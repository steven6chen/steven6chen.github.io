The name doctors use for allergy shots is &quot;allergen immunotherapy.&quot; That's because the shots change the way your immune system reacts to allergens. Allergens are the things that you are allergic to.</p><p>Allergy shots are usually made to order, just for you. They contain tiny amounts of allergens, such as pollen or mold. If you are allergic to stings from bees or other insects, allergy shots can lower your chances of having a dangerous reaction to a sting in the future.</p><p>Allergy shots work for allergies to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pollen from trees, weeds, and grasses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mold spores in the outside air</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cat or dog &quot;dander&quot; (tiny flakes of fur, hair, and skin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dust mites (tiny insects found in dust)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stings from honeybees, yellow jackets, hornets, wasps, and (in some areas) fire ants</p><p/><p>Allergy shots are <strong>not</strong> used to treat allergies to food, latex, or medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552534996\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do I need allergy shots?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have allergies, you should avoid pollen, molds, and other things that cause your allergies. You can also take allergy medicines. But if those treatments don't work well enough, your doctor might recommend allergy shots. Also, in children with nasal allergies, allergy shots can help prevent asthma later in life.</p><p>Your doctor will also recommend allergy shots if you had a serious allergic reaction to a sting from a bee or other insect. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, called &quot;anaphylaxis,&quot; include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing, when your skin turns red and feels hot (especially on your face)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives, which are red, raised, red patches of skin that are very itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema, which is swelling of the face, eyelids, mouth, tongue, hands, and feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73131 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, wheezing, or a change in your voice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throwing up or having diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or passing out</p><p/><p>Allergy shots for insect stings will make you much less likely to get anaphylaxis again if you are stung in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552535059\"><span class=\"h1\">Are allergy shots safe for everyone?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergy shots can be safe for people of all ages. If a woman gets pregnant while she is getting allergy shots, she can keep getting the shots. But pregnant women should wait until after giving birth to start allergy shots for the first time.</p><p>Some medicines, such as beta blockers, can cause problems in people getting allergy shots. Make sure your doctor knows all the medicines you take before starting allergy shots. In some cases, you might need to change your medicines in order to get allergy shots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552535074\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens when I get an allergy shot?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people take an antihistamine before each visit for allergy shots. Common antihistamines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loratadine</a> (sample brand name: Claritin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cetirizine</a> (sample brand name: Zyrtec) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fexofenadine</a> (sample brand name: Allegra).</p><p>When you get to the office, the doctor or nurse might ask you for your name and birth date to make sure you get the right shot and not one made for someone else. You might get just 1 or a few different shots, depending on how many things you are allergic to. Your doctor or nurse will make sure you are healthy enough to get the shot that day. If you have asthma and are having more symptoms than usual, or if you are sick with a fever, you might need to wait and get your shot another day. It is best to call the office before your appointment and check.</p><p>After getting the shot, you will need to stay in the office or clinic for 30 minutes to make sure you do not have a serious reaction to the shot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012874385\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to make my shots as safe as possible?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All medical procedures have risks, and allergy shots do, too. But if you follow your doctor's instructions, allergy shots are very safe. Every time you go to get your shots, the following things should happen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you were told to take an antihistamine, your doctor or nurse will make sure you did this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your doctor or nurse will ask you if you had any reactions after your last shot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your doctor or nurse will ask if anything has changed with your health since your last shot. For example, they need to know if you are taking any new medicines, have any new medical problems, or have gotten pregnant.</p><p/><p>It's important to answer all your doctor or nurse's questions truthfully. Your answers help tell them if you could be at higher risk that day for a serious reaction to the shots.</p><p>After you get your shot, you will need to stay in the office or clinic for 30 minutes. This is so your doctor or nurse can check you for any reactions.</p><p>You should also avoid vigorous exercise for at least a few hours after getting your allergy shots. That's because exercise can make your body absorb the shots faster than it is supposed to. This could put you at risk for an allergic reaction to the shots.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3181370084\"><span class=\"h1\">What type of reactions can happen after an allergy shot?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 types of reactions to allergy shots. The area where the shot was given might turn red, swell, and itch. This is called a local reaction. It can be uncomfortable, but it isn't dangerous.</p><p>In rare cases, people get anaphylaxis from an allergy shot. Anaphylaxis caused by allergy shots can be dangerous. It can even cause death if it's not treated right away. If a person gets anaphylaxis, it usually happens within 30 minutes of getting the shots. If this happens in the doctor's office, it can be treated quickly with a shot of a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a>. This is why it is important to stay in the office or clinic for at least 30 minutes every time you get allergy shots. This is also why allergy shots should always be given in a doctor's office and not at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552535104\"><span class=\"h1\">How often and how long will I need to get allergy shots?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people get allergy shots for 3 to 5 years, although some get them for longer. The first few months, the shots are given 1 to 3 times a week. During this time, the shots get gradually stronger, and allergy symptoms start to improve. After the shots have reached full strength, they are usually given once every 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms then keep improving over the first few years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88390620\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other things I can try besides allergy shots?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There might be. There is a form of treatment that is given as a pill that dissolves under the tongue. This is called &quot;sublingual immunotherapy.&quot; This type of treatment doesn't involve getting shots. But it is only available for a few types of allergies.</p><p>Sublingual immunotherapy is given every day for several months of the year. The first dose is given in the doctor's office, but after that, it is given at home because it's very safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H552535121\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-autoinjectors-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epinephrine autoinjectors (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-avoidance-in-allergic-rhinitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Trigger avoidance in allergic rhinitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic conjunctivitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
