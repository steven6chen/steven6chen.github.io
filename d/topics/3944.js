The presenting symptoms are similar to those of menopause. The condition was previously referred to as &quot;premature menopause&quot; and &quot;premature ovarian failure.&quot; The age-specific incidence of spontaneous POI is approximately 1 in 250 by age 35 years and 1 in 100 by age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In its fully developed form, it is associated with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, symptoms of estrogen deficiency, and gonadotropin levels in the menopausal range before age 40 years.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and evaluation of women with spontaneous POI (focusing on women with a normal karyotype) will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, causes, and management of spontaneous POI, overviews of autoimmune ovarian insufficiency and Turner syndrome, and the evaluation of diminished ovarian reserve in the setting of female infertility are all discussed separately.

It occurs at a median age of 51.4 years in normal women. Menopause is a reflection of complete, or near complete, ovarian follicular depletion, with resulting hypoestrogenemia and high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations. Menopause before age 40 years is considered to be abnormal and is referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The terms &quot;premature menopause&quot; and &quot;premature ovarian failure&quot; were used in the past for POI, but both are inaccurate because many patients with spontaneous POI intermittently produce estrogen and ovulate, a few experience intermittent return of regular menses, and, in 5 to 10 percent of cases, women conceive and have a normal pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

We define occult POI as impaired ovarian responsiveness to exogenous or endogenous gonadotropin stimulation despite the presence of regular and predictable ovulatory menstrual cycles. Overt POI refers to the presence of irregular menses, elevated serum gonadotropins, and reduced fertility.</p><p>Diminished ovarian reserve is not synonymous with POI. It is a term used in the context of female infertility evaluation and treatment. The term refers to women over age 40 years who also have abnormal ovarian reserve testing (including low serum anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone levels), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a poor response to ovarian stimulation during IVF.

The age-specific incidence of spontaneous POI is approximately 1 in 250 by age 35 years and 1 in 100 by age 40 years. (See <a href=\"#H3190334\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>POI is characterized by a change in menstrual function (oligomenorrhea and eventual amenorrhea), elevated serum gonadotropin and low serum estradiol concentrations, and estrogen deficiency symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. However, because intermittent ovarian function occurs in approximately 50 to 75 percent of women with spontaneous POI, the absence of vasomotor symptoms or vaginal dryness should not dissuade one from considering the diagnosis of POI in a woman who presents with menstrual irregularity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F93158\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93158 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3189178\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with POI often experience anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression as a result of their diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3973761571\" class=\"local\">'Emotional health'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is important in order to explain to the patient the variable natural history of the condition, to look for associated diseases, and, most importantly, to treat the hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"#H811668192\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of POI can be made definitively in women younger than 40 years with irregular menses in association with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in the menopausal range levels, as defined by the testing laboratory. The presence of amenorrhea is not required to make the diagnosis, as women frequently have intermittent ovarian function and spontaneous menses even years after their initial presentation.

Despite the fact that early diagnosis of POI is important for osteoporosis prevention (and possibly prevention of later coronary heart disease), many women experience a significant delay in diagnosis after the onset of a disordered menstrual pattern (as long as a five-year delay in 25 percent of women). In addition, over 50 percent of young women with spontaneous POI have reported seeing three or more clinicians before laboratory testing was finally done.
