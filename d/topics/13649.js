Leptin acts on leptin receptors (LEPRs), which are widely distributed and account for its pleiotropic effects on energy homeostasis and neuroendocrine, reproductive, and immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Leptin is produced primarily in fat cells but also in other organs such as the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The physiology of leptin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] and a review of disorders associated with leptin deficiency are reviewed here. The pathogenesis of obesity and lipodystrophy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic contribution and pathophysiology of obesity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipodystrophic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipodystrophic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3889354079\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTION OF LEPTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In humans, the leptin gene is located on chromosome 7q32 and consists of three exons and two introns that span 20 kilobases (kb) of DNA. The mouse and human ob genes have 84 percent homology. The gene codes for a secreted protein of 167 amino acids. Leptin is a member of the cytokine family, and its receptor (LEPR) has similarities to the gp130 group of cytokine receptors.</p><p>There are at least six isoforms of LEPR (LEPR-a to -f) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and all the isoforms are encoded by LEPR gene. The short isoform of the receptor, which is present in several tissues, serves to transport leptin into the brain. There is also a circulating form of the LEPR (LEPR-e) that binds leptin, functions as a leptin-binding protein, and may modulate its action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The LEPR-b receptor is the &quot;longest form,&quot; and in most of the cases, mutations in this isoform cause severe obesity. This form of the receptor is located in several organs but, most importantly, areas of the brain, including hypothalamic and other brainstem nuclei. A number of pathogenic mutations have been reported in both the <em>LEP</em> and LEPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], which can lead to obesity. LEPR-b is also expressed in cells of the immune system and regulates immune function, most importantly, Type <span class=\"nowrap\">1/Type</span> 2 T helper <span class=\"nowrap\">(Th1/Th2)</span> cells balance. It is also expressed in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, where it contributes to the regulation of reproductive function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37639751\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGY OF LEPTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large fat cells produce more leptin than small ones, and serum leptin concentrations are highly correlated with overall body fat content in newborn infants, children, and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Leptin mRNA and secretion by adipocytes declines rapidly during starvation, with circulating leptin levels falling to approximately 50 percent of baseline within a day and to approximately 20 percent of baseline within three days, before any substantial changes in body mass index (BMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899951104\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation of food intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food intake is reduced by exogenous leptin administration at supraphysiologic doses to leptin-deficient or normal-leptin and normal-weight experimental animals, but the response decreases as the animals become obese, with obese animals developing tolerance to both supraphysiologic and pharmacologic doses of leptin. Similar observations have been made in normal-weight or lean human beings who have either normal or low leptin levels. These subjects retain their sensitivity to leptin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] and lose weight (primarily fat) in response to supraphysiologic doses of leptin. Their weight returns to baseline when their leptin levels return to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, obese humans, who are chronically exposed to higher leptin levels (proportional to their fat mass), are resistant or tolerant to exogenous leptin, even when administered in supraphysiologic doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, when leptin is injected directly into the ventricular system of the brain of obese animals, they remain, to a certain extent, responsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Leptin decreases food intake in several ways. In the hypothalamus, it decreases expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most potent stimulators of food intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, the content of anorexigenic neuropeptides such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Lastly, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), produced by posttranslational cleavage of POMC, inhibits food intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2627721581\"><span class=\"h2\">Leptin production in humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BMI and body fat are strongly correlated with both leptin production and circulating concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Under conditions of regular food intake, leptin concentrations communicate the proportion of adipose tissue and status of energy reserves to the brain (and other organs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Overeating increases serum leptin concentrations by nearly 40 percent within 12 hours, long before any changes in body fat stores. Conversely, in normal-weight and obese subjects, fasting reduces serum leptin concentrations by 60 to 70 percent in 48 hours and by approximately 80 percent within three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>], indicating that leptin functions not only as an indicator of long term energy stores but also as a marker of acute changes in energy intake.</p><p>Leptin circulates in the blood stream as both free and bound forms. The binding protein is the extracellular cleaved product of the leptin receptor. Free leptin has unrestricted access to areas of the central nervous system (CNS) not protected by the blood brain barrier, whereas its access to other areas of the CNS depends on expression of the short form of the leptin receptor, which functions as leptin transporter into the CNS and is saturable at high circulating leptin levels.</p><p>In addition to the correlation with body fat content, other characteristics of leptin include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in serum concentrations during childhood (highest in girls and children who gain the most weight). Higher serum leptin concentrations are associated with an earlier onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. After puberty, levels start to decrease in response to rising testosterone in boys, but continue to rise in response to estrogens in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women have higher serum leptin concentrations than men, and pregnant women have higher concentrations than nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-leptin/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Its primary role is to convey information on adequacy of energy reserves to the brain and other peripheral organs. In states of food deprivation, leptin is involved in linking nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune modulation, the regulation of food intake, and energy homeostasis. (See <a href=\"#H37639751\" class=\"local\">'Biology of leptin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum leptin concentrations increase during childhood, with the highest concentrations in children who gain the most weight and in girls. Higher serum leptin concentrations are associated with an earlier onset of puberty, and leptin levels start decreasing in response to rising testosterone in males postpubertally, whereas they continue to rise in response to estrogens in females. (See <a href=\"#H2627721581\" class=\"local\">'Leptin production in humans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (a state of relative leptin deficiency), administration of leptin improves the related immune and neuroendocrine abnormalities, results in resumption of menses in some women, and, over time, leads to improved bone density. Their body weight remains unchanged to the extent that circulating leptin levels are kept within the normal range. (See <a href=\"#H1366482555\" class=\"local\">'Hypothalamic amenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leptin administration in patients with congenital or acquired leptin deficiency (eg, patients with lipodystrophy or hypothalamic amenorrhea) is effective in reversing the neuroendocrine, immune, energy homeostasis, or metabolic abnormalities associated with the deficiency, whereas leptin is ineffective in obese patients with leptin excess (leptin tolerance or resistance).
