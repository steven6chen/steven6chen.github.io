Inhaled glucocorticoid (also called inhaled corticosteroid or ICS) therapy appears to reduce this inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Thus, it has been hypothesized that ICS therapy may also improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>Clinical evidence that ICS therapy is beneficial to patients with COPD is limited. Despite this, 40 to 50 percent of patients with COPD receive ICS therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The likely reason for the widespread use of ICS therapy is the clinician's recognition that COPD can have an asthmatic component and the desire to offer the patient maximal therapy.</p><p>In this topic review, the beneficial and adverse effects of ICS therapy in patients with COPD are discussed. An approach to ICS therapy is also described. Discussions about the management of stable COPD and the role of systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have examined the impact of inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) on lung function, respiratory symptoms, exacerbations, mortality, lung cancer, and airway inflammation. These studies have reported conflicting data for several different outcomes. However, taken together, the data suggest that ICS therapy decreases exacerbations and modestly slows the progression of respiratory symptoms, but has minimal or no impact on lung function and mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of ICS therapy on disease progression, as measured by the annual rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), has been examined in several randomized trials and three meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>]. The largest randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and a meta-analysis found that ICS therapy slightly slowed the decline in lung function, whereas several other studies and a different meta-analysis found no beneficial effect on lung function. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TORCH trial &ndash; The Toward a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) trial randomly assigned 6112 patients with moderate to severe COPD &ndash; mean FEV<sub>1</sub> was 44 percent of predicted &ndash; to one of four treatment arms for three years: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> alone (50 mcg twice daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> alone (500 mcg twice daily), combination therapy (salmeterol plus fluticasone), or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. All active treatments slowed the lung function decline compared with placebo, including fluticasone (-55 versus -42 mL per year). The clinical importance of this small difference is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of trials longer than two years that included the TORCH trial, the mean difference in the rate of decline in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> between ICS and placebo was 6.88 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year</span> (95% CI 1.80-11.96, 4823 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the other hand, a separate calculation in the same report based on pooled difference found a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of decline in post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> with ICS (5.80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/year,</span> 95% CI -0.28 to 11.88; 2333 participants). </p><p/><p>The reason for the conflicting data is uncertain but may be a function of different doses and formulations of inhaled glucocorticoids, length of study, or other confounding factors that influence studies over longer periods of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory symptoms were predetermined secondary outcomes in four out of the five randomized trials and one of the meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/9,11-13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-13,16</a>]. Most demonstrated that ICS therapy slowed the progression of respiratory symptoms modestly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], although one trial found that ICS therapy had no impact on respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life compared with placebo, as measured by a standard respiratory disease questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Exacerbations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid-responsive inflammatory factors appear to play an important role in the initiation and severity of exacerbations of COPD. Thus, it has been hypothesized that ICS therapy may prevent or reduce the severity of COPD exacerbations. Many studies support this theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/11-13,16,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,16,18-22</a>], as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 randomized trials (16,154 participants with COPD) demonstrated that ICS therapy decreased <span class=\"nowrap\">exacerbations/patient/year</span> compared with placebo (-0.26; 95% CI,-0.37 to -0.14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Three other meta-analyses reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/18,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TORCH trial (n = 6112) described above demonstrated that ICS therapy decreased the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.89) and the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic glucocorticoids (RR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.73) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, it did not reduce the rate of severe exacerbations that required hospitalization and its statistical methods have been criticized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial randomly assigned 449 patients with moderate or severe COPD to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a> plus placebo, tiotropium plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, or triple therapy (tiotropium plus <span class=\"nowrap\">salmeterol/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Only triple therapy decreased hospitalizations, implying additive benefit due to the fluticasone.</p><p/><p>However, the notion that ICS therapy decreases exacerbations is not universally accepted. In the Withdrawal of Inhaled Steroids During Optimized bronchodilator Management (WISDOM) trial, 2485 patients with moderate or severe COPD were treated with triple therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>, 500 mcg twice daily) for six weeks and then randomly assigned to withdraw fluticasone over 12 weeks or continue triple therapy with ongoing follow-up for 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Comparing withdrawal of ICS with continuation, the hazard ratio (HR) of a first moderate or severe exacerbation of COPD was 1.06 (95% CI 0.94-1.19). Withdrawal was also associated with a small decrement (mean 38 mL at 18 weeks) in FEV<sub>1</sub>. In our experience, <span class=\"nowrap\">ICS/long-acting</span> beta-agonist (LABA) combinations are often prescribed as first-line therapy for COPD patients who are not in the recommended target group for ICS. The WISDOM trial, along with the availability of newer inhaled bronchodilator treatment options, supports an opportunity for clinicians to reconsider and revise the daily maintenance therapy in selected COPD patients while monitoring for clinical worsening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ICS therapy has not been shown to reduce mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/13,16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,25</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eleven randomized trials (14,426 patients) that included the TORCH trial, long-term ICS therapy had no significant effect on mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.68-1.09) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, the actual effect on mortality may be larger than reported; in the intention to treat analyses, sicker patients in the placebo group may have left trials, seeking active treatment. </p><p>Evidence in support of a modest mortality benefit to the combination of ICS and a LABA comes from a population-based, cohort study that compared 5594 new users of a combination ICS-LABA with 2129 new users of a LABA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. All users were age 66 or older and met a case definition of COPD. New use of LABAs and ICS was associated with a slightly reduced risk of death compared with new use of LABAs alone (HR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective cohort study followed 10,474 patients with COPD for approximately four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. ICS therapy using doses of 1200 mcg per day or higher was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in the incidence of lung cancer (HR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.96). Smaller doses had no effect. These findings require confirmation using controlled trials. Until then, ICS therapy cannot be recommended for the prevention of lung cancer among patients with COPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are conflicting regarding the effect of ICS therapy on airway inflammation. This can be illustrated by the following contrasting studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A double-blinded trial randomly assigned 30 patients with mild chronic bronchitis to receive inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> or placebo, then performed spirometry and bronchoalveolar lavage before and after six weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. ICS therapy improved both spirometry and subjective bronchial inflammation, but placebo did not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (800 mg twice daily) for two weeks to 13 patients with severe but stable COPD did not change the inflammatory indices measured in induced sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These indices included total and differential cell counts, concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, concentrations of eosinophil activation markers (ECP and EPO), and concentrations of neutrophil activation markers (MPO and HNL). In addition, there was no improvement of pulmonary function or symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled glucocorticoid therapy has a few well-described adverse effects in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They include dysphonia, skin bruising, and oral candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/10,12,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,30</a>]. In general, these effects have not been severe enough to alter management, but appear to increase at higher doses and with cumulative exposure. Additional adverse effects, such as subcapsular cataracts, diminished bone density, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, and lung infection, are suspected, but data are conflicting or the occurrence is less common. A more detailed discussion of adverse effects associated with inhaled glucocorticoids is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) are part of the stepwise approach to management of stable COPD, which is intended to control symptoms, decrease exacerbations, and improve patient function and quality of life. COPD patients being considered for treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids will usually have moderate to severe airflow obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ICS therapy is not recommended as monotherapy for patients with stable COPD because inhaled bronchodilators have greater benefits with fewer adverse effects. However, ICS therapy is indicated as an additional therapy for patients with COPD who have symptoms, repeated exacerbations, or severe exacerbations despite an optimal inhaled bronchodilator regimen. This is based on the observation that combination therapy using an ICS and a long-acting beta agonist has greater impact than either agent alone in decreasing the incidence of exacerbations and slowing the progression of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31</a>].</p><p>An optimal inhaled bronchodilator regimen usually includes one or more long-acting inhaled bronchodilators &ndash; a long-acting inhaled beta agonist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a long-acting inhaled anticholinergic. One acceptable approach to initiating ICS therapy is to add an ICS when the existing long-acting inhaled bronchodilator regimen includes a long-acting inhaled beta agonist, or to add the combination of an ICS plus a long-acting inhaled beta agonist when the existing long-acting inhaled bronchodilator regimen does not include a long-acting inhaled beta agonist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An inhaled glucocorticoid may be warranted earlier (ie, at the same time that the long-acting inhaled bronchodilator is initiated) if there are signs of an asthmatic component to the COPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal formulation, dose, and schedule of ICS are unknown. Large clinical trials evaluating the impact of ICS in patients with COPD used relatively high doses of ICS, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> at 400 mcg twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> at 500 mcg twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although small clinical benefits were achieved at these doses, adverse systemic effects were also detected (eg, cataracts, possible pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/13,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32</a>]. In patients with asthma, significantly lower doses of ICS provide most of the obtainable benefits with less toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-inhaled-glucocorticoid-therapy-in-stable-copd/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is unknown if the same is true for patients with COPD. Clinical trials are necessary to compare the benefits and risks of different doses of ICS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Trial of systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been hypothesized that patients with COPD who respond favorably to a trial of systemic glucocorticoid therapy are more likely to benefit from ICS therapy. There is little evidence to support this theory; thus, selection of patients based on their response to a trial of systemic glucocorticoid therapy is not recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282006239\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
