Infections that you can catch during sex are called &quot;sexually transmitted infections,&quot; or &quot;STIs.&quot;</p><p>Both women and men can get trichomoniasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516041\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of trichomoniasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with trichomoniasis have no symptoms. This is true for most men and some women.</p><p>In <strong>women</strong>, the symptoms of the infection include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge that smells bad and might be foamy and greenish-yellow (&quot;vaginal discharge&quot; is the medical term to describe the small amount of fluid that comes out of the vagina)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching of the vagina or the area around the vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or pain during urination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex</p><p/><p>In <strong>men</strong>, the symptoms of the infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge from the penis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or pain during urination</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516056\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you should see your doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms listed above. You should also see a doctor or nurse if any of your sexual partners have had trichomoniasis within the past few months. Even if you have no symptoms, you could be infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516071\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for trichomoniasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. In women, the test involves doing a vaginal exam and taking a sample of vaginal discharge. In men, the doctor might test a sample of urine or discharge from the penis.</p><p>Your doctor might want to test you for other sexually transmitted infections, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516086\"><span class=\"h1\">How is trichomoniasis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trichomoniasis is treated with medicine that comes in pills. There are 2 prescription medicines for trichomoniasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Metronidazole</a> (sample brand name: Flagyl)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Tinidazole</a> (brand name: Tindamax)</p><p/><p>If you learn that you have trichomoniasis, you should contact all the people you have had sex with recently to let them know. That's because they might have trichomoniasis, too. If they have trichomoniasis, they will need treatment even if they have no symptoms. If you are infected, anyone you have sex with should be treated at the same time. Otherwise, your sexual partner could infect you again after you are treated.</p><p>While you are getting treated for trichomoniasis, you should not have sex with anyone. Wait until you have taken all your medicine and have no more symptoms. If you are a woman, your doctor will test you again after you're done taking the medicine to make sure that you haven't been infected again. The repeat test is done between 2 weeks and 3 months after finishing the medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516101\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if I don't get treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you don't get treatment for your trichomoniasis, your symptoms can get worse. Plus, you can keep spreading the infection to your sexual partners. You might also have a higher chance of getting the virus that causes AIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516118\"><span class=\"h1\">Can trichomoniasis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of getting trichomoniasis if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a condom every time you have sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sex when you or your partner has any symptoms that could be caused by an infection. These include itching, discharge, or pain with urination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516133\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
