The disease typically involves the ileum, ileum and cecum, or ileum and entire colon. In some cases, the disease is found only in the colon, making it difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis (UC). Gastritis and upper intestinal tract inflammation are present in 30 percent of patients and may or may not be related to the underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, epidemiology, and risk factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of CD is approximately 5 to 10 new cases per 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">individuals/year</span> and appears to be rising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of these cases are diagnosed in children younger than age 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Although the exact pathophysiology has not been fully defined, there is both a genetic and environmental component. It is likely that inherited gene mutations may predispose individuals with CD to an inflammatory response directed against intraluminal antigens (including intestinal bacteria, dietary antigens, and environmental antigens such as tobacco smoke). Environmental risk factors under investigation include geographic trends, early exposures (breastfeeding, antibiotics), infections, and diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-environmental-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and environmental factors in inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The clinical manifestations of CD in children and adolescents are reviewed here.

Intestinal manifestations are more common. In one of the largest series, which included 891 children ages 6 to 17 years, the most common presenting symptoms were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain &ndash; 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; 39 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; 23 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal bleeding &ndash; 21 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perianal disease &ndash; 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor growth &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouth sores &ndash; 3 percent</p><p/><p>Younger children (&lt;6 years) presenting with CD were somewhat less likely to present with abdominal pain (25 percent), weight loss (8 percent), and more likely to present with rectal bleeding (33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In both age groups, growth failure is frequently present at the time of diagnosis, but may not be recognized by the child or family. The earliest and most subtle form of growth failure is a decrease in height velocity; this may progress to short stature for age, delayed bone age, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pubertal delay.

A small number of children have more diffuse small bowel disease, isolated perianal disease, esophageal or gastric disease,<strong> </strong>or severe orofacial disease. Patients may be classified by age, disease location (ileum only, colon only, ileocolon, or upper gastrointestinal tract), and disease behavior (inflammatory, stricturing, or penetrating), as described in the &quot;Paris&quot; classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89025 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89028 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H1252945866\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H828643533\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Scoring disease activity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372147052\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial proportion of children and adolescents with CD develop intestinal complications, which are an important cause of morbidity. Patients who tend to develop these complications are often categorized as having a <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;stricturing/penetrating&quot;</span> phenotype, present in about 30 percent of pediatric patients, and up to 45 percent of adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The main risk factor for these complications is severe disease (affecting all layers of the intestinal wall compromising luminal and bowel wall integrity), especially in the ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Children diagnosed during adolescence appear to have a higher risk for these complications as compared with those diagnosed at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They are most likely to develop over time in patients with severe or refractory disease, but occasionally are a presenting feature. These complications include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fistulae &ndash; Fistulae may develop between the diseased bowel and a variety of adjacent tissues. Fistulae between different segments of the bowel (enteroenteric) may be asymptomatic, or may cause symptoms because of malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Fistulae from the bowel to the bladder (enterovesicular) tend to present with recurrent urinary tract infection or a sensation of air in the urine stream (pneumaturia). Fistulae from the bowel to the genitalia (enterogenital) tend to present with pain or fecal leakage. Fistulae from the bowel to the skin (enterocutaneous) are most common in the perianal area, and may form subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment may include immunomodulators, biologic agents, antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> with bowel rest; surgery (intestinal diversion) is used for fistulizing disease that is refractory to treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease#H1725477551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;, section on 'Fistulizing disease'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized peritonitis &ndash; Localized peritonitis tends to present with fever, chills, leukocytosis, nausea or vomiting, and focal abdominal pain, often in the right lower quadrant. It is caused by a microperforation of the bowel with containment of the resultant infection by surrounding bowel loops. The initial treatment usually consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease#H3844492305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;, section on 'Localized peritonitis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal abscess &ndash; Abscesses tend to develop adjacent to actively inflamed bowel loops and may develop further into a fistula. As with localized peritonitis, patients tend to present with fever, leukocytosis and focal abdominal pain, often in the right lower quadrant or pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A high index of suspicion is warranted for patients who are immunosuppressed, who may present with more subtle symptoms and without fever or leukocytosis. The onset of symptoms may be gradual or sudden. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The evaluation includes imaging (ultrasonography, computerized tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Initial treatment consists of antibiotics, typically with percutaneous drainage for those that are &gt;2 cm in diameter, and optimization of CD therapy. Because abdominal abscesses result from bowel perforations (typically in the ileum), surgical resection of the diseased bowel is frequently needed. On occasion, these abscesses can be managed by drainage and optimization of medical treatment (eg, adding biologics or immunomodulators), but this approach may result in recurrence of the abscess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-crohn-disease-of-the-small-bowel-colon-and-rectum#H4011010630\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of Crohn disease of the small bowel, colon, and rectum&quot;, section on 'Abscess'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease#H331427493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;, section on 'Abscess'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bowel obstruction &ndash; Severe disease of the small intestinal lumen, with ulceration and transmural inflammation, tends to lead to stricture formation. Depending on the location and severity, this can cause partial or complete intestinal obstruction, presenting with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A stricture often becomes symptomatic because of superimposed inflammation and spasm, so the obstruction may be relieved by conservative management with bowel rest and parenteral glucocorticoids. Acute deterioration (eg, worsening obstruction or bowel ischemia) may require urgent surgery. Elective surgery is frequently required in patients who develop recurrent obstructive episodes from a fibrotic stricture.

In one report, for example, 67 of 230 (29 percent) children and adolescents with CD had significant perianal pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Perianal involvement may be mild (consisting of small skin tags or anal fissures) or more severe (abscesses and fistulae). In a series of pediatric patients with CD, 10 percent had perianal fistulas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscesses at the time of diagnosis, and one-third of these had persistent perianal disease for more than one year despite treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As many as 5 percent of children develop a highly destructive form of perianal disease that is characterized by recurrent perianal abscesses, fistulae involving the genitalia, and the development of rectal strictures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75104 \">picture 1</a>). Such severe disease may be refractory to medical treatment (including antibiotics, biologic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, immunomodulators such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]). Surgical options for perianal fistulas include Seton placement or fistulotomy; a minority of patients may require colonic diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].

These disorders appear idiosyncratically in some patients and not others, but are more often associated with colonic disease; they do not consistently correlate with the degree of intestinal inflammation.

These disorders appear idiosyncratically in some patients and not others, but are more often associated with colonic disease.
