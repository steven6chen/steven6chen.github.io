Melanocytic nevi may be congenital or acquired. Acquired nevi can be classified as common (banal) or atypical, and there are several additional variants, including halo nevi, blue nevi, and Spitz nevi.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The names applied to acquired nevi reflect the location of the nests of melanocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65457\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65457 \">figure 1</a>). In junctional nevi, the nests of melanocytes are at the dermal-epidermal junction. In compound nevi, the nests of melanocytes are at the dermal-epidermal junction and in the dermis. In intradermal nevi, the nests of melanocytes are in the dermis. With progressive migration of melanocytes from the dermal-epidermal junction into the dermis, nevi become more elevated and less pigmented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Predisposing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors related to the development of nevi (with the exception of blue and perhaps Spitz nevi) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heredity, with a familial tendency to have a large number of moles. Germline<em> </em>polymorphisms that impact the number, morphology (eg, raised versus flat), and dermoscopic features (eg, globular versus reticular pattern) of nevi have been identified in several genes, including interferon regulatory factor 4 (<em>IRF4</em>) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (<em>TERT</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of sun exposure during childhood, especially when intense and intermittent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Although the results of studies evaluating the effects of sunscreen use on the development of nevi are inconsistent, in one randomized controlled study, school-aged children who were supplied with and instructed to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen developed significantly fewer new nevi over a three-year period than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Secondary environmental factors that influence development and growth of acquired melanocytic nevi in children include blistering disorders, lichen sclerosus, chemotherapy, systemic immunosuppression, and endocrine conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phenotypic characteristics such as skin type, with higher nevus counts seen in individuals with lightly pigmented skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/3,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-12</a>]. The mean number of nevi in white adolescents is approximately 15 to 30, compared with five or fewer in adolescents of African, Asian, or Native American heritage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].

Less commonly, they occur in acral sites such as the palms, soles, and nail matrix.

Substantial nevus turnover also occurs during the first two decades of life.

Although a changing nevus may raise concern for melanoma in an adult, enlargement and increased elevation occur as part of the normal natural history of nevi in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The clinical and histologic evolution of individual lesions from junctional to compound to dermal nevi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65457\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65457 \">figure 1</a>) can correspond to this cycle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Junctional nevi &ndash; Junctional nevi are macular or minimally raised, have preserved skin markings, and range from brown to black in color, sometimes with darker pigmentation in the center than at the edge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57022 \">picture 4</a>).

Occasionally, they have speckles of brown pigmentation, terminal hairs, or pseudo-horn cysts (ie, accumulations of keratin within invaginations of hyperplastic epidermis). Pseudo-horn cysts occur more frequently in seborrheic keratoses, which typically develop in adults, than in intradermal nevi.

In contrast, a reticular pattern is more common in acquired nevi located on the extremities and in children with darker pigmentation, as well as in nevi that develop during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Histologically, the globular pattern is associated with a prominent dermal component with or without large junctional nests, while the reticular pattern corresponds to a prominent junctional component with lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia with or without small junctional nests. Acquired nevi with a globular pattern are threefold more likely to have an underlying somatic <em>BRAF</em> V600E<sup> </sup>activating mutation than those with a reticular pattern (approximately 90 versus approximately 30 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most acquired nevi remain benign throughout the lifetime of a person and require no treatment other than longitudinal observation. However, having a large number of acquired nevi increases the risk of melanoma, and patients with multiple acquired nevi should be followed with periodic total body skin examinations and counseled regarding sun protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Considerable controversy has surrounded terms such as dysplastic nevus, and the 1992 NIH Consensus Conference recommended the use of the more clinically descriptive term &quot;atypical nevus&quot;. They also recommended that the lesions be described histologically as &quot;nevi with architectural disorder,&quot; with specification of the degree of melanocytic atypia present (ie, none, mild, moderate, or severe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Atypical nevi are associated with a total increased number of acquired nevi (eg, greater than 50). In white populations, the prevalence of atypical nevi is approximately 2 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Atypical nevi often do not appear until puberty and are believed to develop throughout life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Their density is generally greater on areas of the body that receive intermittent sun exposure (eg, the trunk and lower extremities) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78891 \">picture 8</a>) than sites that are not exposed to sun (eg, breast and buttocks).

Somatic genetic alterations underlying Spitz nevi range from activating <em>HRAS </em>mutations to fusions involving genes encoding kinases (eg, <em>ALK, ROS1</em>) that stimulate oncogenic signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, germline mutations in the <em>BAP1</em> gene lead to a rare autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome that features spitzoid neoplasms and an increased risk of uveal as well as cutaneous melanoma and other tumors such as mesothelioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-melanocytic-nevi-moles/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].
