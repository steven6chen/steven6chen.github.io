Mycoplasmas are ubiquitous and are the smallest organisms that can survive alone in nature. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> most commonly causes upper respiratory tract infections but can also cause pneumonia. Many extrapulmonary manifestations have been described, although a causal link has not been established for many of these.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of infections, primarily pneumonia, caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in adults will be reviewed here. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infections in children as well as <em>M. hominis</em> infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325624843\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;mycoplasma&quot; is widely used to refer to any organism within the class Mollicutes that is composed of five genera (<em>Mycoplasma</em>, <em>Ureaplasma</em>, <em>Acholeplasma</em>, <em>Anaeroplasma</em>, and <em>Asteroloplasma</em>). Over 120 named <em>Mycoplasma</em> species exist and 13 <em>Mycoplasma</em> species, two <em>Acholeplasma</em> species, and one <em>Ureaplasma</em> species have been isolated from humans. However, only four species are well-established human pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Mycoplasma hominis</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em></p><p/><p>A subsequently described <em>Mycoplasma</em> species, <em>M. amphoriforme</em>, appears capable of causing relapsing pneumonia through person-to-person spread in both immunocompetent and patients with primary antibody deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living organisms. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> is a short rod, but, due to the lack of a cell wall, it is not visible following Gram staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It grows under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and can be isolated on specialized media supplemented with serum. However, the organism is fastidious, and isolation is not commonly performed in clinical laboratories. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which mycoplasmas produce infection are becoming better understood. Pathogenic organisms for humans and animals possess specialized tip organelles that mediate their interactions with host cells through a P1 adhesin protein that contributes to adherence and gliding motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Host-adapted survival is achieved by surface parasitism of target cells, the acquisition of essential biosynthetic precursors, and, in some cases, cell entry and intracellular survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Certain strains of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> elaborate biofilms that may protect against both antimicrobial penetration and host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Toll-like receptor 2 is believed to be important for binding of <em>Mycoplasma</em> and activation of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The inhaled glucocorticoid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate, reduced inflammation but also decreased concentrations of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in the lung in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><em>M. pneumoniae</em> most commonly exists in a filamentous form, and its adherence proteins attach to epithelial membranes with particular affinity for respiratory tract epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Once attached, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> produces hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, causing injury to epithelial cells and their associated cilia. However, many of the pathogenic features of infection with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> are believed to be immune mediated rather than induced directly by the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In addition, the antibodies produced against the glycolipid antigens of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> may act as autoantibodies, since they crossreact with human brain cells and erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], as manifested in the cold agglutination phenomenon (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cold agglutinins'</a> below).</p><p>Two major strains of clinical isolates, type 1 and type 2, which differ in their adhesin gene sequence, have been described. Type 2 strains exhibit higher expression of community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin, which has been shown to be a virulence factor causing vacuolization and that may play a role in respiratory epithelial destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In addition, type 2 elaborates a more robust biofilm, presumably conferring increased resistance to host defense mechanisms. There does not seem to be a correlation between adhesion type and macrolide resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> is transmitted from person to person by infected respiratory droplets during close contact. The incubation period after exposure averages two to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Infection occurs most frequently during the fall and winter but may develop year round [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Overall, it is estimated that nearly 1 percent of the population is infected annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The cumulative attack rate in families approaches 90 percent, and immunity is not long lasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Recognized outbreaks of mycoplasma infection have been described in military recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], institutions for developmentally disabled individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], long-term care facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and in the community, including periodic epidemics over a number of years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. These epidemics may extend over wide geographic areas, such as the 2011 to 2012 epidemic with <em>M. pneumoniae </em>reported from reference labs in several European countries (Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France). Rates of detection were 10 to 13 percent in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases and then decreased to as low as 1 to 2 percent the following two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>].</p><p>A study of three epidemics involving 779 patients over a 10-year period (2003 to 2012) in one hospital showed a 3 to 4 year periodicity with peaks in the autumn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Presentation and demographics were similar in each epidemic except that the age group peak was younger (1 to 4 years old) in the last outbreak. Outbreaks have occurred with similar periodicity in other locations, but the peak incidence has been variable depending on the location.</p><p>A report of an outbreak in a military unit of 91 trainees illustrates the high attack rate in closed settings and identified risk factors for symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. During a 12-day period, 41 trainees (45 percent) had respiratory illness; 10 (11 percent) developed pneumonia. Multivariate analysis identified two factors associated with symptomatic <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower preexisting immunoglobulin G levels (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.8, 95% CI 1.3-42.5)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking (aOR 5.6, 95% CI 1.5-20.4)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">M. pneumoniae and atypical pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia in series from the United States and other parts of the world. Mycoplasma infection can occur at any age, but infection rates are highest among school-aged children, military recruits, and college students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Atypical pneumonia (due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>, or <em>Legionella</em> spp) has been thought to account for 7 to 20 percent of CAP for which a pathogen can be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. However, the incidence may be higher in patients with milder disease that can be managed without hospitalization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of studies from different parts of the world report on the incidence of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> as a cause of CAP. Most studies, even those that use serologic and molecular techniques, fail to identify any pathogen in nearly 50 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Incidence estimates vary depending upon the techniques used for diagnosis, the age of the patients, and whether the series includes outpatients, hospitalized patients, or both, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study published in 1996 employed careful serologic techniques to establish the etiologic agent for CAP in nonhospitalized patients; <em>M. pneumoniae</em> was identified as the sole agent in 23 percent and was identified along with <em>C. pneumoniae</em> in a further 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective series of 1300 patients with pneumonia requiring hospitalization, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> accounted for 5 percent of all cases and 9 percent in older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings have been noted in series from Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], Switzerland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], Israel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], and Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance study during 2010 to 2012 using polymerase chain reaction detected <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in 43 of 2259 adult patients (2 percent) with CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">M. pneumoniae and asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection may worsen asthma symptoms and can produce wheezing in children who do not have asthma. A separate question, for which there has been some experimental and clinical evidence, is whether <em>M. pneumoniae</em> might have a pathogenic role in asthma. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children&quot;, section on 'Possible relation to asthma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many infections due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> are asymptomatic. When present, the signs and symptoms vary according to the stage of illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59329 \">figure 1</a>). The onset of the illness is gradual and is usually heralded by headache, malaise, and low-grade fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/16,19,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,42</a>]. Chills are frequent, but rigors are rare. Patient complaints usually exceed objective findings since abnormalities on physical examination are often minimal.</p><p>Symptoms and signs due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection may be divided into those due to respiratory tract involvement and those due to extrapulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory tract disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with respiratory infection due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> do not develop pneumonia. In one review, for example, 75 to 100 percent of infected patients had an intractable, nonproductive cough, whereas only 3 to 10 percent developed pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The cough due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection is incessant and ranges from nonproductive to mildly productive, with sputum discoloration occurring late in the disease. Wheezing and dyspnea may occur, although dyspnea is not a common complaint. Chills are common, but rigors are very rare.</p><p>Additional respiratory symptoms include pharyngitis (6 to 59 percent), rhinorrhea (2 to 40 percent), and ear pain (2 to 35 percent). Clinically inapparent sinusitis may coexist with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>There may be no findings on chest auscultation even if pneumonia is present early in the course of disease. However, scattered rales, wheezes, or both may be present later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other respiratory tract findings may include sinus tenderness, mild erythema of the posterior pharynx, erythema of the tympanic membrane, and non-prominent cervical adenopathy. Pleural effusion occurs in about 15 to 20 percent of patients with pneumonia. It is usually serous in nature, and pleuritic pain and empyema are rare. However, chest soreness from persistent coughing is common.</p><p>Although most cases of pneumonia caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> are mild and self-limited, fulminant cases have occurred. (See <a href=\"#H104064217\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrapulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caution must be exercised in attributing extrapulmonary involvement to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection. Many intra- and postinfection manifestations have been attributed to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> because of an intercurrent increase in mycoplasma antibodies in the presence of one of these manifestations. Because <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection is so common, in some of these instances, simultaneous occurrence is probably coincidental. Single-case reports abound in the literature. Some manifestations, however, occur with sufficient frequency to indicate causality. These extrapulmonary abnormalities are an important part of mycoplasma disease and may suggest the diagnosis. They include hemolysis, skin rash, joint involvement, and symptoms and signs indicative of gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system (CNS), and heart disease. None of these manifestations occur in more than 5 to 10 percent of patients with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection. It is not clear whether the pathogenesis of some or all of these entities is due to immune mechanisms or to the direct action of the organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgM antibodies to the I antigen on erythrocyte membranes appear during the course of infection and produce a cold agglutinin response in about 60 percent of patients (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cold agglutinins'</a> below). Cross reaction between mycoplasma antigens and human ones is thought to promote the production of such autoantibodies. Although hemolysis may be severe, especially in patients with sickle cell disease, it is usually not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-cold-agglutinin-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Cold agglutinin disease&quot;</a>). <em>M. pneumoniae</em> organisms have been shown to elaborate hydrogen sulfide, which may contribute to hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermatologic manifestations may range from a mild erythematous maculopapular or vesicular rash (which is most commonly seen accompanying respiratory tract infections) to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In one report, for example, 16 percent of patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome had evidence of mycoplasma infection, which may be the most common infectious agent associated with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. When Stevens-Johnson syndrome is associated <em>with M. pneumoniae</em> infection, patients are more likely to have pneumonia than upper respiratory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Raynaud phenomenon may also be seen in <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection, possibly secondary to cold agglutinin formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Central nervous system involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNS manifestations occur in approximately 0.1 percent of all patients with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infections and in up to 7 percent of those patients requiring hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. CNS involvement occurs most frequently in children, with encephalitis as the most common manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Other manifestations include aseptic meningitis, peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, and cerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can lead to some of the most severe complications associated with mycoplasma infection. In one literature review, 59 percent of patients presenting with spinal cord involvement suffered permanent neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The pathogenesis of the CNS disease is uncertain. Possibilities include direct infection and an immune-mediated reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], in which antibodies to <em>Mycoplasma</em> might cross-react with galactocerebroside. These antibodies have been detected in patients with post-<em>Mycoplasma</em> encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] and may prove helpful in diagnosis.</p><p>In cases of CNS involvement due to <em>M. pneumoniae</em>, a history of an antecedent respiratory illness is usually, but not always, found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In one retrospective review of cases at the Mayo Clinic, 7 percent of patients with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia had CNS involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; the prevalence of neurologic involvement with mycoplasma is likely to be significantly lower in the community.</p><p>Although uncommon, CNS involvement is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Cardiac syndromes include rhythm disturbances, congestive heart failure, chest pain, and conduction abnormalities on the electrocardiogram. Myocarditis has been described in rare autopsy reports since the disease is usually not fatal. There are several case reports of mycoplasma-associated thrombosis involving the heart and other vessels; the suggested pathophysiology is the formation of anticardiolipin antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The FilmArray respiratory panel, a multiplex assay, has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection using nasopharyngeal samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].

The incidence of cold agglutinins is highest in children and decreases with age.

If the disease is encountered late in its course, a fourfold fall in titer is as useful as a fourfold rise. A somewhat inferior surrogate for this change in titer is a single high titer of IgM antibodies (as opposed to IgG), since IgM antibodies rise earlier than IgG antibodies. IgM antibody titers begin to rise approximately seven to nine days after infection and peak at three to four weeks. In the past, the most widely used approach for serodiagnosis was the complement fixation (CF) test, which measured IgM (predominantly) and IgG antibody (to a lesser extent) to <em>M. pneumoniae</em>. High titers of IgG antibodies alone are not diagnostic of current infection and usually represent previous infection that may not relate to the syndrome at hand. More recently, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) techniques have been used with a sensitivity of 97.8 percent and specificity of 99.7 percent. EIAs are more sensitive for detecting acute infection than culture and can be comparable in sensitivity to the polymerase chain reaction, assuming that the duration of infection is sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>A positive EIA result is best determined by comparing acute and convalescent phase sera two to three weeks apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Beta-lactams such as penicillin and other antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis are ineffective because <em>Mycoplasma </em>species do not have a cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>We favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> for five days (500 mg for the first dose, then 250 mg daily for the next four days) for most patients with pneumonia caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em>. Patients treated with other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or a fluoroquinolone) should receive 7 to 14 days of therapy. In the era before extended-spectrum macrolides, relapse was common with less than two weeks of therapy. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because of the organism's ability to reside intracellularly. Few studies have evaluated the therapy of complicated disease, but, in view of the issues outlined above, it would seem prudent to tailor the length of therapy to the resolution of signs and symptoms rather than adhering to a fixed duration for all cases.</p><p>Macrolide resistance has been increasing in frequency in various regions, particularly in Asia. In a surveillance study from Japan from 2008 to 2013, 50 to 93 percent of isolates from children were resistant to macrolides, and the incidence of macrolide resistance increased over the time period assessed in the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Mycoplasma infection can occur at any age, but infection rates are highest among school-aged children, military recruits, and college students. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with respiratory infection caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> may have cough, pharyngitis, rhinorrhea, and ear pain; only 10 percent of patients develop pneumonia. No clinical or radiographic features distinguish mycoplasma pneumonia from pneumonia of any other etiology. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapulmonary manifestations may involve hemolysis (rarely clinically significant), skin rash including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, carditis, and, more common in children, encephalitis and other central nervous system complications. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Extrapulmonary disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic testing for <em>M. pneumoniae</em> remains inadequate since most laboratories do not process cultures of the organism, serology requires paired serum specimens, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing is not widely available. Thus, most treatment is empiric. In 2012, a multiplex PCR assay was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a diagnosis is sought, multiplex PCR is the diagnostic test of choice, if available. Serology should be performed if PCR is not available or as an adjunct to PCR. (See <a href=\"#H346331\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for mycoplasma pneumonia include macrolides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, and fluoroquinolones. We suggest empiric treatment for suspected mycoplasma pneumonia with a five-day course of oral azithromycin (500 mg for the first dose, then 250 mg daily for the next four days) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients treated with other agents (eg, doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone) should receive 7 to 14 days of therapy.
