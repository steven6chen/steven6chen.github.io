In the setting of severe illness, treatment with second-line agents may need to be initiated prior to availability of drug susceptibility results. In such cases, treatment decisions should be based on the drug susceptibility pattern of the source case to whom the patient has been exposed, prior treatment regimens of the patient (ie, agents that have not been used previously are preferred), and the likelihood of cross-resistance based on previous agents used. Dosing and adverse effects for second-line agents are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66493 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Oral medications for treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR)- or extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB should be given daily, not intermittently. In patients with normal renal function, injectable-only agents (aminoglycosides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capreomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capreomycin</a>) are given daily during the initial phase of treatment, then decreased to three times per week during the continuation phase.

In one study including 834 patients with suspected drug-resistant TB, mortality rates among those treated with either moxifloxacin or levofloxacin were half those of participants not treated with any fluoroquinolone or treated only with an earlier-generation fluoroquinolone (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.26-0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Since all fluoroquinolones share a genetic target (DNA gyrase), there is no role for simultaneous use of more than one drug in this class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-18</a>].</p><p>Cross-resistance between fluoroquinolones is common but not universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. When fluoroquinolone resistance is detected by culture-based drug susceptibility testing or molecular testing, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> may be performed to determine whether an increased dose may be considered. Use of &quot;high-dose&quot; moxifloxacin (600 mg or 800 mg orally once daily) may achieve adequate serum concentrations in patients for whom the isolate's MIC to moxifloxacin is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL;</span> however, this approach has not been studied in clinical trials, and the safety of such dose escalations has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The fluoroquinolones are generally well-tolerated. Rare complications include tenosynovitis (including reports of Achilles tendinitis and rupture) and exacerbation of symptoms among patients with myasthenia gravis and peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levofloxacin</a> is less frequently associated with QT interval prolongation than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> (standard dose), so levofloxacin may be preferred for patients on a regimen including other agents associated with QT prolongation (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bedaquiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bedaquiline</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66493 \">table 3</a>).

Kanamycin is no longer available in the United States. There is no role for use of more than one of these injectable agents in a treatment regimen given their common mechanism of action (eg, protein synthesis inhibition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/10,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,18</a>].</p><p>The choice of these injectable agents depends on a patient's previous injectable agent use (if any), risk of adverse events, and in vitro susceptibility data. In general, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> is the preferred agent (due to general availability of the drug and serum concentration monitoring). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capreomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Capreomycin</a> should be reserved for situations in which there is demonstrated resistance to amikacin and for patients with XDR-TB. In addition, it may be associated with less ototoxicity than amikacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> should be avoided given widespread resistance. Use of streptomycin is generally restricted to the setting of known in vitro susceptibility, no history of prior use, and contraindication to amikacin.</p><p>Cross-resistance among the injectable-only agents has been observed and may be helpful in predicting use of alternate agents in the setting of prior injectable exposure (pending definitive susceptibility data) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/1,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25-29</a>]. Cross-resistance between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capreomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capreomycin</a> is incomplete, while streptomycin-resistant isolates are often susceptible to other aminoglycosides or capreomycin (unless they have been used previously).</p><p>Aminoglycosides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capreomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capreomycin</a> can be given either intramuscularly or intravenously. For patients who cannot tolerate repeated intramuscular injections, intravenous therapy may be administered. They are typically given five days per week; they should be administered seven days per week for patients who are severely ill. The initial duration of daily therapy (referred to as the &quot;intensive phase&quot; of treatment) is administered until culture conversion is documented (at least two to three months and can be up to six months). After culture conversion, three-days-per-week dosing can be used for the remaining duration (referred to as the &quot;continuation phase&quot; of treatment [normally through at least 6 months and up to 18 months beyond culture conversion]).</p><p>Serum drug concentration monitoring is warranted for all aminoglycosides and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capreomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capreomycin</a> given their potential for nephrotoxicity and consequent electrolyte disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antituberculous-drugs-an-overview/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
