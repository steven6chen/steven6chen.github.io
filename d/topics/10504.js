Prosthetic heart valves may be mechanical or bioprosthetic (the latter including heterografts and homografts).</p><p>Mechanical heart valves are associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events during pregnancy. Therapeutic anticoagulation throughout pregnancy is essential to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but given the absence of adequate prospective controlled trials and the differing maternal and fetal risks associated with various anticoagulants, the optimum anticoagulant regimen is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Bioprosthetic valves typically do not require anticoagulation (unless there are other thromboembolic risk factors). However, bioprostheses have a significantly higher incidence of valve failure than mechanical valves. This is an important concern for young women, who must consider the potential for future valve surgery if they have a bioprosthesis.

A review of early publications reporting LMWH use in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves (16 studies, 1996 to 2003) found thromboembolic complications occurred in 12.3 percent of 81 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Publication bias in part contributes to these rates, with the higher rate of thromboembolic events in the second review due to inclusion of a greater number of single case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. In several cases, thrombotic events were related to use of subtherapeutic doses of LMWH, suboptimal anti-Xa activity, and poor patient compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/10,28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28,30</a>]. </p><p>Studies suggest the rate of thromboembolic events in pregnant women with mechanical valves may be lower when therapeutic LMWH is managed with intensive anti-Xa monitoring, followed by dose adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/10,11,28,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,28,29,31</a>]. In these small cohorts, a total of 109 pregnancies treated with twice-daily, dose-adjusted therapeutic LMWH have been reported.

In the remaining 95 pregnancies, thromboembolic complications occurred in 9.5 percent of women with mechanical valves treated with therapeutic range LMWH. In eight of the nine pregnancies with thromboembolic complications, there was subtherapeutic dosing, poor compliance, or low anti-Xa activity. There was one maternal death related to valve thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These data suggest that if therapeutic LMWH with dose adjustment to maintain anti-Xa activity of 1.0 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> is achieved, the risk of thromboembolic complications is low, probably less than 5 percent. When translated into clinical practice, however, the failure rate is likely to be on the order of 5 to 10 percent due to issues such as patient compliance. In a systematic review, studies that used subtherapeutic, unadjusted, or unclear anticoagulation regimens were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-for-a-prosthetic-heart-valve-during-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In making this recommendation, we are placing high value on reducing maternal risk. Pregnant women with mechanical valves who place a high value on minimizing fetal risk may reasonably choose dose-adjusted twice daily subcutaneous (SC) LMWH (target anti-Xa level 1.0 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for mitral valve and 0.8 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for aortic valve replacements at four to six hours post-dose, with trough activity checked as well) during the first trimester.

A plan should be made prior to conception as to how this change in therapy will be arranged ideally before five weeks gestation. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4273873921\"><span class=\"h4\">During the second and third trimesters</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VKA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) is the anticoagulant option associated with the lowest maternal risk for pregnant women with a mechanical valve. After the first trimester, the risk of warfarin associated fetopathy declines although there remains a risk of fetal loss and fetal hemorrhagic complications. (See <a href=\"#H2663499058\" class=\"local\">'Evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women with mechanical valves, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (adjusted to INR goal) during the second and third trimesters until 36 weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

SC LMWH is dosed twice per day with the dose adjusted to achieve target anti-Xa activity of 1.0 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for mitral valve prosthesis and 0.8 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> for aortic valve prosthesis at four to six hours post-dose and ensuring adequate trough activity as well.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3748288194\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripartum management for mechanical valves</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To minimize the risks of maternal and fetal hemorrhage, the following changes in antithrombotic therapy for pregnant women with mechanical valves should be made as the time for delivery approaches. A plan for anticoagulation in <span class=\"nowrap\">labor/peripartum</span> should be agreed to by obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and hematologists and documented clearly. The risks of valve thrombosis and obstetric hemorrhage as well as the desire to use regional anesthesia need to be balanced and the patient fully informed of the rationale for the individualized plan. (See <a href=\"#H1774597690\" class=\"local\">'Approach for planned delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At approximately 36 weeks, VKA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) should be switched to dose-adjusted SC LMWH administered at least twice per day. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We prefer to continue low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> up until planned delivery. This should be discussed with the anesthesiologist, as aspirin with concurrent early postpartum anticoagulation may increase the risk of spinal epidural hematoma. (See <a href=\"#H324632545\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women treated with SC LMWH can be switched to either dose-adjusted IV UFH (target aPTT at least twice control) prior to the induction of labor or cesarean delivery, in order to provide tighter control of anticoagulation throughout the peripartum period as detailed above, or receive prophylactic doses of LMWH. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On rare occasions, urgent delivery is necessary for a woman with a mechanical valve while she is still receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Management involves balancing the risk of life-threatening maternal hemorrhage against the potentially catastrophic risk of thromboembolism or valve thrombosis if anticoagulation is reversed and the fetal consequences of not performing an urgent delivery. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Approach for urgent delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of significant bleeding, anticoagulation for women with mechanical valves should be resumed shortly after delivery.
