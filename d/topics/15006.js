Although ACE inhibitors are relatively ineffective as monotherapy in black patients, the addition of even a low dose of a thiazide diuretic to an ACE inhibitor leads to a fall in blood pressure that is comparable with that seen in white patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-blacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in blacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The utility of ACE inhibitors with diuretics is not limited to black patients, since these drugs have a synergistic effect, attaining goal blood pressure in up to 85 percent of patients with mild hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The antihypertensive response to diuretics is often limited by the hypovolemia-induced increase in renin release and subsequent angiotensin II production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; this effect is prevented by converting enzyme inhibition, leading to a more prominent reduction in blood pressure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of thiazide diuretics in patients with primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>). For similar reasons, dietary sodium restriction can also enhance the response to an ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>ACE inhibitors minimize some of the metabolic changes induced by diuretic therapy. Hypokalemia, for example, is less prominent because the reduction in angiotensin II formation induced by the ACE inhibitor leads to decreased secretion of aldosterone. ACE inhibitors also do not induce glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, or hyperuricemia; may increase insulin sensitivity; and may minimize or prevent diuretic-induced elevations in serum glucose, cholesterol and uric acid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Apart from diuretics, calcium channel blockers can be used effectively with ACE inhibitors, and, as shown in the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial, may have clinical advantages over diuretics when achieved blood pressure is similar. Combination of an ACE inhibitor with a beta blocker may be less useful because of inferior antihypertensive activity compared with other ACE inhibitor combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This relative lack of efficacy may be due in part to similar mechanisms of action, as angiotensin II formation and renin secretion are respectively reduced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'ACCOMPLISH trial'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other antihypertensive agents, proper dose can minimize the incidence of side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64770\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64770 \">table 1</a>). To minimize the risk of first-dose hypotension due to an abrupt decline in angiotensin II levels, the patient should not be volume depleted. The initial dose can be reduced by one-half in older adult patients or those with heart failure who are at higher risk for hypotension. Side effects other than those related to hypotension can occur with ACE inhibitors, the most common being cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], less commonly hyperkalemia, and rarely angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. ACE inhibitors are <strong>contraindicated</strong> during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Some ACE inhibitors can be given once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trandolapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trandolapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benazepril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benazepril</a>). The use of longer-acting agents once daily should improve patient compliance, reduce costs, maintain smoother control, and ensure that the abrupt rise in pressure upon awakening in the early morning is blunted, hopefully thereby reducing the incidence of serious cardiovascular events at this time.</p><p>After the initiation of therapy, the patient should be reexamined in a few weeks to allow the full antihypertensive effect to occur. If there is no or little fall in blood pressure with an adequate dose, the drug can be stopped and different class of drug started, a concept called &quot;sequential monotherapy.&quot; Alternatively, another drug may be added, such as a calcium channel blocker. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Sequential monotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>If the patient's blood pressure is reduced by the ACE inhibitor but the goal pressure is not achieved, the dose can be gradually increased to the maximum levels noted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64770\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64770 \">table 1</a>). However, the addition of a second drug from a different class will provide much greater antihypertensive effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In patients with extensive atherosclerosis or renal insufficiency who are more likely to have renovascular stenoses, a repeat plasma creatinine concentration should be obtained within one to two weeks of ACE inhibitor or ARB initiation to ensure that renal perfusion has been maintained. However, a modest and nonprogressive increase in the plasma creatinine in such patients should <strong>not</strong> prompt discontinuation of therapy.

Blockade of the action of angiotensin II leads to elevations in plasma levels of renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II. However, this build-up of precursors does not overwhelm the receptor blockade, as evidenced by a persistent fall in both blood pressure and plasma aldosterone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences between ACE inhibitors and ARBs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are substantial pharmacologic differences in the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), but few clinical differences have been documented.

Thus, inhibiting this enzyme, which normally degrades bradykinin, with an ACE inhibitor leads to increased kinin levels, an effect not seen with an ARB.

The effect of the angiotensin II produced by this reaction can be inhibited by the ARBs but not by ACE inhibitors.

However, several studies have shown that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a>, when given once daily, does not control blood pressure to the same magnitude as other ARBs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=irbesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irbesartan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telmisartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telmisartan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. On the other hand, losartan produces a slight fall in plasma uric acid that does not occur with the other ARBs, an effect that is due to enhanced uric acid excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This appears to be mediated at least in part by direct inhibition of the proximal urate-anion exchanger that is responsible for urate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The antihypertensive efficacy of ARBs appears to be roughly equivalent to that of the ACE inhibitors. A meta-analysis of 61 studies that directly compared angiotensin II receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors reported no difference in the antihypertensive effects of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In addition, the effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular events appear similar.

Aliskiren lowers blood pressure to a degree comparable with most other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A number of studies have evaluated the blood pressure-lowering effect of aliskiren in combination with other antihypertensive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. In one report, the combination of maximum doses of aliskiren and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> decreased blood pressure more than maximum doses of either agent alone but not more than would be expected with dual therapy using drugs from different classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

However, this effect on proteinuria did <strong>not</strong> translate into a clinical benefit. In the Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiorenal Endpoints (ALTITUDE), 8600 patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease already taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) were randomly assigned to additional therapy with aliskiren or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The ALTITUDE trial was stopped early because of futility (no benefit on the primary cardiovascular and renal outcomes) and because aliskiren therapy produced a nonsignificantly higher rate of adverse events (ie, nonfatal stroke, hypotension). The ALTITUDE trial is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy#H16004841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Aliskiren plus angiotensin inhibition'</a>.)</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aliskiren-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aliskiren</a> on progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in patients with controlled hypertension was examined in the Aliskiren Quantitative Atherosclerosis Regression Intravascular Ultrasound Study (AQUARIUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this trial, 613 patients with a systolic blood pressure between 125 and 139 mmHg (most of whom were treated with antihypertensive medications) and two other cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned to aliskiren (300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo. After 18 months, the atherosclerotic burden and progression of atherosclerosis (measured by coronary intravascular ultrasound) was similar between the groups. In a secondary analysis based upon a small number of events, aliskiren appeared to reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. However, this analysis excluded diabetic patients who were treated with angiotensin inhibitors (approximately 15 percent of the study population), as such patients were removed from the study after publication of the ALTITUDE trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of settings in which ACE inhibitors are the antihypertensive drugs of choice because of possible benefits in addition to lowering the blood pressure (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Specific indications for use'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proteinuric chronic kidney disease, both diabetic and nondiabetic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After a myocardial infarction in most patients, particularly those with heart failure or reduced systolic function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper dose of ACE inhibitors can minimize the incidence of side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64770\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64770 \">table 1</a>). The duration of action varies with different ACE inhibitors. Some ACE inhibitors can be given once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trandolapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trandolapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benazepril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benazepril</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are pharmacologic differences in the actions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Except for the cough associated with ACE inhibitors, these pharmacologic differences are not associated with clinically meaningful differences in therapeutic effects. At least three factors may contribute to the pharmacologic differences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55726 \">figure 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differences between ACE inhibitors and ARBs'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ACE is a <strong>kininase</strong>. Thus, inhibiting this enzyme, which normally degrades bradykinin, with an ACE inhibitor leads to increased kinin levels, an effect not seen with an ARB. This is likely responsible for the cough that may be seen with ACE inhibitors (but not with ARBs), although high bradykinin levels may also provide additional vasodilation and other benefits not observed with ARBs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By decreasing angiotensin II production, ACE inhibitors reduce the effect of both AT1 and AT2 receptors; only the former are inhibited by the ARBs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the heart, kidney, and perhaps the blood vessels, the production of angiotensin II may be catalyzed by enzymes other than ACE, such as chymase. The effect of the angiotensin II produced by this reaction can be inhibited by the ARBs but not by ACE inhibitors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ARBs have an effect similar to that seen with monotherapy with other antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64770\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64770 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antihypertensive effect of both ACE inhibitors and ARBs is enhanced by concomitant administration of low doses of a diuretic and by a reduction in dietary sodium intake. Both drugs also appear to minimize the hypokalemia and hyperuricemia induced by diuretic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs are generally well tolerated. Side effects other than those related to hypotension can occur with both drugs, including hyperkalemia and rarely angioedema, as well as acute kidney injury in patients with low effective arterial blood volume (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, and heart failure). Cough is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are <strong>contraindicated</strong> during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined therapy with both an ACE inhibitor and ARB is <strong>not</strong> recommended for the treatment of hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'ACE inhibitors plus ARBs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first effective oral direct renin inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aliskiren-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aliskiren</a>, lowers blood pressure to a degree comparable with most other agents. In combination with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, aliskiren increases the risk of adverse effects and does not lower the risk of cardiovascular event. Thus, aliskiren should <strong>not</strong> be combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
