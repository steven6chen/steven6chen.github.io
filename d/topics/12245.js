A total of 60 patients (8 percent) had underlying immunosuppression. It appears that the period of greatest risk for the development of fungal meningitis was during the first six weeks (42 days) after receiving an epidural or paraspinal injection with contaminated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although early in the outbreak the majority of patients presented with meningitis, the percentage of patients presenting with epidural abscess, phlegmon, discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, or arachnoiditis at or near the site of injection increased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,13</a>]. Of 91 cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between November 4<sup> </sup>and November 19, 2012 (more than one month after the outbreak was recognized), 26 (29 percent) had meningitis and 61 (67 percent) had an epidural abscess or vertebral osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In a cohort analysis that included 66 patients from Tennessee affected by the outbreak, using a univariate analysis, the risk of infection was increased with exposure to one of the three implicated lots of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (lot #06292012@26), older vials, higher doses, multiple procedures, and translaminar approach to epidural injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a multivariate analysis that was confined to patients who received methylprednisolone with a known case status and that excluded time periods of potential lot overlap, risk factors for infection included age older than 60 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.01, 95% CI 1.95-8.24), female sex (aOR 2.56, 95% CI 1.29-5.12), and increasing cumulative dose of lot #06292012@26 injected 45 to 60 days after production (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.63) and more than 60 days after production (aOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.11).</p><p>The overall attack rate (ie, the rate for any fungal infection meeting the case definition) as of July 1, 2013, was 5.5 cases per 100 persons potentially exposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The attack rate for meningitis, stroke due to presumed meningitis, and spinal or paraspinal infections was 5.9 cases per 100 persons potentially exposed but varied widely by state (range 0 to 18 cases per 100 exposed persons).</p><p>A disproportionate number of patients in Michigan developed paraspinal or spinal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. Only 13 percent of potentially contaminated vials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> were shipped to Michigan, yet as of September 6, 2013, 214 of 477 cases (45 percent) of paraspinal or spinal infections and 19 of 64 deaths (30 percent) occurred in Michigan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. The reasons why Michigan has had more reported cases of paraspinal or spinal infections remain unclear. One possible reason is that St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, the hospital at which most cases in Michigan were treated, implemented an expanded diagnostic approach, which involved offering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every two to three weeks to all individuals who had received injections with potentially contaminated methylprednisolone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This approach might have resulted in increased case finding. Other variables that could potentially account for this difference include varying concentrations of fungus in specific drug lots and different injection techniques; the latter possibility remains speculative.</p><p>It has been estimated that public health actions averted 3150 injections with contaminated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, 153 cases of meningitis or stroke, and 124 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176154162\"><span class=\"h2\">Case counts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As of October 2015, 753 cases, including 64 fatal cases, had been reported in 20 states in association with the outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The following types of infections were reported to the CDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis only &ndash; 234 patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis and paraspinal or spinal infection &ndash; 152 patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke (without lumbar puncture only) &ndash; 7 patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraspinal or spinal infection only &ndash; 325 patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral joint infection only &ndash; 33 patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraspinal or spinal infection and peripheral joint infection &ndash; 2 patients</p><p/><p>More information about case counts can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis-map-large.html&amp;token=plq+heGYDvDdssSP0w8SLWpnf9Toe3Z1sAWZHWR0F/ieqaDNYrqO1u56Gvdzp0nhjb4v50jiqKM9+n3LEo86HA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=86766\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1215467\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common pathogen identified in patients affected by the outbreak has been <em>Exserohilum rostratum</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86772\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86772 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. Many patients affected by the outbreak have had negative microbiologic studies despite having evidence of disease. As an example, among 799 specimens (including cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], synovial fluid, and abscess tissue) submitted to the CDC from 469 case patients, a fungus was detected in 213 specimens from 166 patients, which represents only 35 percent of patients from whom specimens were submitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. <em>E. rostratum</em> was the predominant organism identified, although it was confirmed in only 150 (32 percent) of total cases. The types of specimens from which <em>E. rostratum</em> was detected included CSF (90), fresh frozen tissue samples (37), formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples (10), synovial fluid (4), abscess fluid (1), and epidural fluid (1). In addition, 48 isolates sent from local microbiology laboratories were identified as <em>E. rostratum</em>. Thirteen other mold species were also identified among case patients and four other mold species were isolated from the implicated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> vials; these species included <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, <em>Alternaria </em>spp, <em>Cladosporium </em>spp, <em>Penicillium </em>spp, and others. The importance of these other species is not known.</p><p><em>Exserohilum</em> spp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86772\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86772 \">picture 1</a>) are dematiaceous (also termed brown-black, darkly pigmented, or melanized) fungi that rarely cause infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Their dark color is due to the presence of melanin. Three <em>Exserohilum</em> species have been described (<em>E. rostratum</em>, <em>E. longirostratum</em>, and <em>E. mcginnisii</em>), but molecular studies have suggested that they are likely to be the same species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Prior to this outbreak, phaeohyphomycosis, or infection by dematiaceous fungi, was rarely caused by <em>Exserohilum</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. In immunocompetent persons, most infections are localized and are secondary to inoculation of soil or plant material or inhalation into the upper respiratory tract. <em>Exserohilum</em> has been reported as a cause of allergic fungal sinusitis, keratitis, and cutaneous and subcutaneous infections.

Compounding pharmacies are not regulated by the FDA, and state pharmacy boards provide inconsistent oversight. Unlike pharmaceutical manufacturers, compounding pharmacies are not required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of their products or adhere to manufacturing or labeling standards. In response to this outbreak, the FDA has offered the opportunity for compounding pharmacies to voluntarily register with the organization as &quot;outsourcing facilities,&quot; which entails adherence to current good manufacturing processes (including batch sterility testing and surveillance and quality control measures) in addition to other requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/outbreak-of-fungal-central-nervous-system-and-osteoarticular-infections-in-the-united-states-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].
