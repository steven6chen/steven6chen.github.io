These characteristics distinguish stridor from typical wheezing due to diffuse airflow limitation (asthma or bronchiolitis), which tends to consist of multiple sounds that start and stop at different times. The term is derived from the Latin verb <em>stridere</em>, meaning to make a harsh noise or shrill sound, as to creak. </p><p>Stridor is caused by the oscillation of a narrowed airway, and its presence suggests significant obstruction of the large airways. The acoustics of stridor may be explained as a result of Bernoulli's Principle, which states that as the speed of a moving fluid increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases. In an application in which airflow is forced through a narrowed tube, a local area of low pressure creates a vacuum effect distal to the narrowing. The focal area of low pressure distal to a narrowed airway causes the airway walls to collapse and vibrate, generating the squeak characteristic of stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A commonly encountered presenting symptom in the pediatric population, stridor is an important physical finding that requires prompt evaluation and occasionally requires emergency intervention. The pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and clinical management of stridor will be reviewed here.

The walls supporting this region are made of soft tissue and muscles, and lack cartilaginous support. Therefore, airway collapse and obstruction can occur easily and progress rapidly in this area. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glottic and subglottic area</strong> &ndash; This portion of the airway extends from the vocal cords to the extrathoracic segment of the trachea, just before it enters the thoracic cavity. The glottic area has some cartilaginous support (ie, cricoid cartilage and incomplete tracheal rings), which makes it less vulnerable to collapse than the supraglottic area. The subglottis, surrounded by the cricoid cartilage, is the narrowest part of the trachea. The diameter of the subglottis is 5 to 7 mm at birth and steadily increases to an average diameter on 20 mm in adults. In the narrow airway of an infant, a small decrease in diameter dramatically increases the airway resistance (because resistance is inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power [r<sup>4</sup>]). As an example, a narrowing by 1 mm in the subglottic area in an infant will decrease the cross-sectional area by approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and increase airway resistance 16-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p>Classic diseases that cause obstruction at extrathoracic level include laryngomalacia, laryngotracheitis (croup), retropharyngeal abscess, epiglottitis, and craniofacial malformations. (See <a href=\"#H732228960\" class=\"local\">'Causes of stridor'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrathoracic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intrathoracic region includes the portion of the trachea that lies within the thoracic cavity, as well as the mainstem bronchi. Compression of the proximal trachea can result in expiratory stridor, whereas compression of the more distal intrathoracic airways tends to cause typical polyphonic wheezing rather than stridor. Congenital disorders are a prominent cause of obstruction at this level (eg, vascular rings and webs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Foreign bodies and compression by enlarged lymph nodes or tumors can also occur at this level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H732228981\" class=\"local\">'Chronic/recurrent'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Auscultatory clues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stridor is a high-pitched monophonic sound made during breathing, which is usually inspiratory and is heard best over the anterior neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114053\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114053 \">movie 1</a>). Its presence suggests significant obstruction of the large airways. These acoustic characteristics of stridor distinguish it from typical wheezing due to asthma or bronchiolitis, which tends to consist of multiple sounds that start and stop at different times, and is caused by diffuse airflow limitation of the distal intrathoracic airways.</p><p>In normal individuals, during inspiration, the extrathoracic pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure and exceeds the intratracheal pressure. This produces some collapse of the airway, which is not clinically relevant. By contrast, in patients with a non-rigid airway obstruction, the increased Bernoulli effect results in a substantial drop in the airway pressure beyond the obstruction, leading to the collapse of the airway walls and an increase in the obstruction. This in turn limits the airflow and causes turbulence and vibration of the airway walls, thus generating the monophonic squeak characteristic of stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with minor degrees of airway narrowing the stridor may occur only during activity (eg, crying or exercise).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inspiratory stridor</strong> &ndash; In general, stridor originating from obstruction in the <strong>extrathoracic</strong> region is more pronounced during inspiration, when the pressure inside the airway falls below atmospheric pressure, causing airway collapse<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65386%7EPEDS%2F101485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65386 graphicRef101485 \">figure 1A-B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expiratory stridor</strong> &ndash; In contrast, stridor originating from obstruction in the <strong>intrathoracic</strong> region is more pronounced on exhalation, since intrathoracic pressure rises on expiration and causes airway collapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55931 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biphasic</strong> <strong>(inspiratory and expiratory) stridor</strong> &ndash; A <strong>fixed</strong> (rather than dynamic) central airway obstruction usually produces noise on both inspiration and expiration. The stridor may be more evident in either phase of breathing, depending on the effort the child makes on inspiration compared with expiration. Fixed central and upper airway obstructions may sound similar regardless of location in the intra- and extrathoracic locations. Conditions causing fixed airway obstruction include external compression, intraluminal airway masses (eg, hemangioma or foreign body), and mural changes in the airway, such as subglottic stenosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Stridor caused by obstruction at the glottis (vocal cords) may occur during inspiration only, or during both inspiration and expiration, since the shape and size of this part of the airway change little during the process of respiration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stertor or snoring</strong> &ndash; If airway narrowing originates from the nasal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal areas (ie, adenoid hypertrophy, micrognathia, macroglossia, and tonsil hypertrophy), the noise generated is typically low pitched. It may be referred to as snoring if it occurs when the patient is sleeping, and stertor if it is present when the patient is awake. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732228960\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF STRIDOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stridor may result from a variety of conditions that can be either congenital or acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62718%7EPEDS%2F101526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62718 graphicRef101526 \">table 1A-B</a>).

Symptoms develop within minutes or a few hours, and may progress rapidly. The main considerations are listed here, and a general approach to management is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Foreign body aspiration</strong> &ndash; Foreign body aspiration should always be suspected in an infant or toddler who presents with sudden or intermittent onset of stridor, with or without respiratory distress, and without other physical findings. Its incidence peaks around two to three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If an infant is in an environment with older children, foreign body aspiration can occur at an earlier age. A history of a witnessed choking episode is common, but may not be recalled by the caregiver because it appeared to resolve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Anaphylaxis (most commonly caused by food or medications) is a common cause of acute-onset stridor, and may be severe and life-threatening, particularly when edema involves the retropharynx <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larynx. Common manifestations include respiratory symptoms (change in voice quality, choking, stridor, wheezing, drooling, or cough), skin symptoms (hives, itching, and mouth swelling), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 2</a>). Presenting symptoms in infants are similar but can be more difficult to recognize (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64957 \">table 3</a>).

Most patients have prodromal symptoms and signs suggestive of viral respiratory tract infection for one to three days before more severe signs of illness develop, including stridor and respiratory distress, often with cough and a preference to lie flat. Although uncommon, it is among the most frequent pediatric airway emergencies requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Without treatment, it can progress rapidly to life-threatening airway obstruction. Young children classically present with respiratory distress, anxiety, and fever, often with dysphagia, drooling, and muffled speech, and reluctance to lie flat. In the past, epiglottitis commonly occurred between two and seven years of age. Since the introduction of the H. influenzae type B (HIB) vaccine, the incidence of epiglottitis has dropped dramatically; however, there are still case reports of HIB epiglottitis occurring despite immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The peak age of epiglottitis is now greater than seven years, but epiglottitis can occur at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The clinical presentation of thermal epiglottitis injuries in children may be similar to that of acute infectious epiglottitis, and should be managed as an emergency airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Airway burns also should always be considered in any child with body scald burns who presents with stridor or respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Smoke or steam inhalation can cause direct thermal injury to the upper respiratory tract.

Accompanying symptoms of vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and oropharyngeal swelling may resemble anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caustic esophageal injury in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults#H865108365\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis in children and adults&quot;, section on 'Caustic ingestion (young children)'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732228974\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following disorders typically present with respiratory symptoms that progress gradually to stridor (eg, over the course of a few days):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngotracheitis (croup)</strong> &ndash; Croup accounts for more than 90 percent of all cases of stridor in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It most commonly occurs in children 6 to 36 months of age. It is also seen in younger infants (as young as three months) and in preschool children, but is rare beyond age six years. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, beginning with nasal irritation, congestion, and coryza, and progressing to inspiratory and sometimes expiratory stridor. Symptoms generally progress over 12 to 48 hours to include fever, hoarseness, barking cough, and stridor. Croup is usually a mild and self-limited disease, but occasionally causes significant respiratory distress and can be life-threatening. A spasmodic form of croup is characterized by brief recurrent episodes of stridor, occurring at night. For children with a typical presentation of croup, confirmation of a viral cause is not necessary, since croup is a self-limited illness that usually requires only symptomatic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Retropharyngeal abscess</strong> &ndash; Most retropharyngeal abscesses occur in children between two and four years of age. Early in the disease process, the findings may be indistinguishable from those of uncomplicated pharyngitis. As the disease progresses, symptoms include fever, dysphagia and drooling, unwillingness to move neck, muffled or &quot;hot potato&quot; voice, and inspiratory stridor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peritonsillar abscess</strong> &ndash; Peritonsillar abscess generally arises as a complication of tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Its incidence peaks in children older than 10 years of age, when streptococcal pharyngitis becomes more common. The typical clinical presentation is a severe sore throat (usually unilateral), fever, muffled or &quot;hot potato&quot; voice, sometimes with inspiratory stridor, drooling, trismus, or neck swelling.

It typically presents during the neonatal period and progresses during infancy, but resolves by 12 to 18 months. The stridor is inspiratory and tends to be worse in the supine position and during feeding and sleeping.

Most lesions are intrathoracic, causing airway collapse and stridor during expiration, often with a croup-like cough. Most affected infants improve spontaneously by 6 to 12 months of age as airway caliber increases and cartilage develops.

Infants with bilateral paralysis typically present with stridor and respiratory insufficiency, and may have normal cry. Those with unilateral paralysis tend to present with hoarseness and are at risk for aspiration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular ring</strong> &ndash; Vascular rings (including a pulmonary artery &quot;sling&quot;) cause stridor due to external compression of the trachea. The presentation varies from marked respiratory distress in neonates to intermittent stridor in infants and young children. Because the compression is intrathoracic, the stridor usually is loudest in the expiratory phase. In some cases, the esophagus is also compressed, leading to dysphagia, hyperextension of the head during feeding, or other feeding difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Associated anomalies are common, especially cardiac defects.

It is characterized by papillomatous growth of the epithelium of the airways (larynx and trachea). RRP has a bimodal age distribution and manifests most commonly in children younger than five years (juvenile-onset) or in persons in the fourth decade of life (adult-onset). The larynx is frequently affected. Patients can present with chronic or progressive stridor, hoarseness of voice or weak cry, choking episodes, cough, and wheezing if trachea is also involved.

The pattern of onset may be acute, subacute, or intermittent, depending on the cause. Children with bilateral paralysis typically present with stridor and respiratory insufficiency, and may have normal <span class=\"nowrap\">voice/cry</span>.

Most reports are in infants with vitamin D deficiency and rickets secondary to dietary insufficiency, but some cases have occurred in the setting of other metabolic and endocrine disorders that lead to severe hypocalcemia, such as renal failure and hypoparathyroidism. The associated stridor can be chronic or intermittent but also may present with acute severe onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tumor</strong> &ndash; Any tumor that compresses the airway may present with stridor.

Key steps are to evaluate upper airway patency, the degree of respiratory effort, evidence of hypoxemia and fatigue, and to monitor closely for the possibility of rapid deterioration. Diagnostic testing may need to be delayed to provide appropriate supportive care. In an acutely ill patient, diagnostic testing should only be performed in a controlled setting and with close supervision by a clinician who can intervene if the patient's respiratory function deteriorates. The rapid assessment and stabilization of such patient is detailed in a separate topic.

The timing of symptom onset (congenital, gradual, or after an acute event) and associated symptoms help to distinguish among these possibilities. Intermittent episodes of stridor or wheezing in which the onset and cessation are abrupt may indicate vocal cord dysfunction.

However, patients with a serious bacterial infection occasionally are afebrile on presentation to the physician. Fever is also common among children with laryngotracheitis (croup) but tends to be lower than in bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental status &ndash; Alteration in mental status (lethargy, anxiety) with increased work of breathing can point to an impending airway obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooling &ndash; Drooling and a muffled voice usually suggest that the obstruction is supraglottic, including retropharyngeal abscess and epiglottitis. Drooling and dysphagia can occur with epiglottis, a foreign body in the trachea, or a mass compressing the anterior esophageal wall. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough &ndash; A barking cough is almost always present in laryngotracheitis (croup), and typically absent in children with acute epiglottitis, foreign body aspiration, and anaphylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voice tone &ndash; A change in the voice tone (hoarseness or pitch) suggests a laryngeal lesion such as vocal cord injury due to inflammation (eg, croup) or paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A muffled voice suggests supraglottic obstruction, such as in retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess or epiglottitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stridor during feeding &ndash; Respiratory distress and stridor related to feeding can be caused by aspiration either secondary to swallowing dysfunction, certain types of tracheoesophageal fistula, or gastroesophageal reflux. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives &ndash; Presence of rash, hypotension, and wheezing with acute onset of stridor indicates an allergic reaction with angioedema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset during sleep &ndash; If a patient develops airway obstructive episodes during sleep, it is most likely that the origin of the stridor arises from the pharynx, in which case, the tonsils and adenoids should be evaluated. Spasmodic croup also tends to present episodically during sleep.

Any significant surgical history (patent ductus arteriosus ligation, cardiac, or neck surgery) should be reviewed. It is important to learn whether there have been previous admissions secondary to respiratory diseases, and whether the patient ever required prolonged intubation.

However, it can be a useful tool in evaluating a child with severe or atypical features, or other suspected causes of stridor, including foreign body aspiration. Prior to obtaining any radiographs, the clinician should evaluate the child and assess the risk of developing complete airway obstruction during the procedure. If any life-threatening situation is suspected, the patient must be accompanied to the radiology suite by appropriate medical personnel with the equipment necessary for airway management, including emergency tracheotomy or cricothyroidotomy. For children with suspected epiglottitis and stable respiratory status, radiography usually can be performed safely with close supervision.

More than one airway abnormality may be present in the same child, and a thorough evaluation of the upper and lower airways may be warranted. </p><p>Airway visualization with the intention of intubation should be promptly performed if the underlying cause of stridor in an acutely ill child is thought to be epiglottitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74563\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74563 \">picture 3</a>) or bacterial tracheitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55364\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55364 \">picture 4</a>). Patients with suspected or known foreign body aspiration also require examination of the airway, usually as part of a procedure to remove the foreign body. These procedures should be performed by clinicians with experience in intubation and manipulating pediatric airways. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasopharyngoscopy is appropriate for the patient with a stable airway and can be performed in an unsedated and awake child at the bedside. Nasopharyngoscopy is useful in the diagnosis of laryngomalacia and anatomic defects between the nose and pharynx, as well as in the assessment of vocal cord movement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible or rigid laryngoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bronchoscopy are appropriate for the patient with an unstable airway, or for those with suspected foreign body aspiration. These procedures should be performed in the operating room, with anesthesia, sedation, and continuous monitoring. In cases of suspected epiglottitis, direct laryngoscopy usually can be performed safely by experienced interventionists with little risk of complications such as laryngospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-stridor-in-children/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Airway visualization is also indicated for many patients with chronic or intermittent stridor, to evaluate the airway and establish a diagnosis. Rigid laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are the gold standards for evaluation and diagnosis of subglottic, tracheal, and central airway lesions. The rigid bronchoscope allows the clinician to take biopsy samples, remove foreign bodies, and dilate stenosed airways, if necessary. If a foreign body is not suspected, a flexible bronchoscope is usually used, and the examination is performed during spontaneous breathing to help identify abnormalities in airway dynamics, including laryngomalacia.

It is typically inspiratory, but occasionally heard on expiration or throughout the respiratory cycle. The sound is caused by narrowing of the upper or central airway. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stridor originating from the extrathoracic area is more pronounced during inspiration and tends to abate during exhalation. Stridor caused by obstruction at the glottis (vocal cords) may occur during inspiration only, or during both inspiration and expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101485\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101485 \">figure 1B</a>). Critical and fixed airway obstruction typically results in biphasic inspiratory and expiratory stridor. Compression of the proximal trachea can result in expiratory stridor, but most other types of intrathoracic airway compression usually give rise to coarse wheezing rather than stridor. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Auscultatory clues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stridor may result from a variety of conditions that can be either congenital or acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62718%7EPEDS%2F101526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62718 graphicRef101526 \">table 1A-B</a>). The timing, acuity of onset, and associated symptoms help to narrow the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common cause of stridor in children is laryngotracheitis (croup), which tends to have gradual onset of symptoms with associated congestion, hoarseness, barking cough, and stridor, with or without fever. (See <a href=\"#H732228974\" class=\"local\">'Subacute onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe or rapidly progressive symptoms with fever suggest epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis. These disorders are rare but may be life-threatening. Acute onset of symptoms without fever suggests foreign body aspiration, airway burns, or anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H732228967\" class=\"local\">'Acute onset'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Congenital anomalies can cause stridor through intrinsic or extrinsic obstruction of the upper airway. Most present during the first few weeks of life, but symptoms may be intermittent, and some anomalies such as bronchogenic cysts and laryngeal clefts may present later in infancy or childhood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62718 \">table 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H732228981\" class=\"local\">'Chronic/recurrent'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of children with stridor must begin with a rapid assessment to identify patients who need intervention or are in danger of imminent decompensation. Key steps are evaluation of upper airway patency, the degree of respiratory effort, and the effectiveness of respiratory function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children#H324322281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the clinical history and physical examination narrow the diagnostic possibilities, radiographic studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct examination of the airway are selected for further evaluation. The diagnosis of laryngotracheitis (croup) is clinical; radiography and laboratory studies usually are not needed for patients with typical features.
