In the United States, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed visceral cancer; in 2018, there are expected to be approximately 165,000 new prostate cancer diagnoses and approximately 29,000 prostate cancer deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prostate cancer is second only to nonmelanoma skin cancer and lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer and cancer death, respectively, in United States men. Worldwide, there are an estimated 1,600,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 366,000 prostate cancer deaths annually, making it the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the seventh leading cause of male cancer death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>For an American male, the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer is 16 percent, but the risk of dying of prostate cancer is only 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Many more cases of prostate cancer do not become clinically evident, as indicated in autopsy series, where prostate cancer is detected in approximately 30 percent of men age 55 and approximately 60 percent of men by age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These data suggest that prostate cancer often grows so slowly that most men die of other causes before the disease becomes clinically advanced.</p><p>Prostate cancer survival is related to many factors, especially the extent of tumor at the time of diagnosis. The five-year relative survival among men with cancer confined to the prostate (localized) or with just regional spread is 100 percent, compared with 29.3 percent among those diagnosed with distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While men with advanced stage disease may benefit from palliative treatment, their tumors are generally not curable.</p><p>Thus, a screening program that could accurately identify asymptomatic men with aggressive localized tumors might be expected to substantially reduce prostate cancer morbidity, including urinary obstruction and painful metastases, and mortality.</p><p>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing revolutionized prostate cancer screening. Although PSA was originally introduced as a tumor marker to detect cancer recurrence or disease progression following treatment, it became widely adopted for cancer screening by the early 1990s. Subsequently, professional societies issued guidelines supporting routine prostate cancer screening with PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. PSA testing led to a dramatic increase in the incidence of prostate cancer, peaking in 1992 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75684 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of these newly diagnosed cancers were clinically localized, which led to an increase in radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, aggressive treatments intended to cure these early-stage cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>Prostate cancer screening is controversial, with conflicting data as to efficacy. Thus, professional society guidelines (American College of Physicians [ACP], American Cancer Society [ACS], American Urological Association [AUA], US Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO]) uniformly recommend supporting men to make informed decisions about screening that reflect their personal preferences and values. In 2009, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) reported a small absolute survival benefit with PSA screening after nine years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; however, 48 additional patients would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer to prevent one prostate cancer death. Longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC subjects showed increasing benefit of screening in reducing risks for prostate cancer mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At the same time, the large randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial in the United States reported no prostate cancer mortality benefit, even after 15 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], but these negative results have been largely discounted due to methodological flaws, including a high contamination rate (PSA testing in the control arm of the study). Investigators now describe the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial as a comparison between organized versus opportunistic screening.</p><p>This topic reviews the screening tests that are available for prostate cancer, the efficacy of screening, and the recommendations of major medical associations and societies regarding screening for prostate cancer. Risk factors and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of prostate cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein produced by prostate epithelial cells. PSA levels may be elevated in men with prostate cancer because PSA production is increased and because tissue barriers between the prostate gland lumen and the capillary are disrupted, releasing more PSA into the serum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-prostate-specific-antigen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of prostate-specific antigen&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies have estimated that PSA elevations can precede clinical disease by 5 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] or even longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, PSA is also elevated in a number of benign conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79754 \">table 1</a>), particularly benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Measuring PSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the PSA elevations seen with BPH, there are transient causes of PSA elevation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79754 \">table 1</a>), some of which are significant enough to affect the performance of PSA measurement as a screening test.</p><p>We describe PSA values in <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> throughout this topic, but this is equivalent to the SI units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L;</span> that is, 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> = 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-prostate-specific-antigen#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of prostate-specific antigen&quot;, section on 'Causes of an elevated serum PSA'</a>.)</p><p>PSA has a half-life of 2.2 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and levels elevated by different benign conditions will have variable recovery times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. PSA testing should be deferred accordingly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digital rectal examination (DRE) has minimal effect on PSA levels, leading to transient elevations of only 0.26 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and PSA can be measured immediately after DRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ejaculation can increase PSA levels by up to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> though levels return to normal within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. We do not usually ask men to abstain from sexual activity prior to PSA measurement. However, if an initial measurement is high enough to potentially prompt an intervention (ie, biopsy), but close to a threshold value, it is appropriate to repeat the PSA measurement after having the man abstain from ejaculation for at least 48 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial prostatitis may elevate PSA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but they generally return to baseline six to eight weeks after symptoms resolve. Asymptomatic prostatic inflammation can also elevate PSA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but this diagnosis is made on biopsy and so cannot generally be used to defer screening tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate biopsy may elevate PSA levels by a median of 7.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> within 4 to 24 hours following the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Levels will remain elevated for two to four weeks. Similarly, a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can elevate PSA levels by a median of 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Levels will remain elevated for a median time of approximately three weeks. A screening PSA test should not be performed for at least six weeks following either of these procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute urinary retention or recent urethral instrumentation may elevate PSA levels, but the levels can be expected to decrease by 50 percent within one to two days following resolution. A screening PSA test should not be performed for at least two weeks following an episode of acute urinary retention.</p><p/><p>The five-alpha reductase inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dutasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dutasteride</a> lower PSA levels. Finasteride lowers PSA levels by a median 50 percent within six months of use, though the effects can vary widely, ranging from -81 percent to +20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]; dutasteride has been reported to reduce PSA levels by 48 to 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Some experts recommend doubling the measured PSA value before interpreting the result for patients on finasteride or dutasteride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Longitudinal results from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggest that PSA values be corrected by a factor of 2 for the first two years of finasteride therapy, and by 2.5 for longer-term use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Results from the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial suggested that a rise in PSA levels while on dutasteride is associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Test performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the accuracy of PSA testing has been difficult because most men with normal PSA values will not undergo biopsy unless their DRE is abnormal. This workup bias tends to overestimate sensitivity and underestimate specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Performance can also be overestimated because PSA often detects clinically unimportant cancers. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Overdiagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Another problem in assessing the accuracy of PSA is that the transrectal needle biopsy is not a perfect gold standard. Investigators have suggested that the false-negative rate can range from 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], though the trend towards obtaining 12 samples has increased the detection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Additionally, protocols that use large numbers of biopsies to evaluate patients with an elevated PSA may be detecting incidental cancers that were not the etiology of the PSA elevation. One review that assumed that nonpalpable cancers smaller than 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup> would not cause elevated PSA levels estimated that approximately 25 percent of cancers detected by PSA screening were too small to have accounted for the PSA rise that prompted a biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic performance of PSA ideally needs to be calibrated against clinically important cancers. However, there is no consensus on defining such cancers. Although many experts consider tumors with Gleason scores &ge;7 and volumes &gt;0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> to have a greater risk for progression, there is no certainty that these cancers will lead to early death or reduce quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensitivity and specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional cutoff for an abnormal PSA level in the major screening studies has been 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. The American Cancer Society (ACS) systematically reviewed the literature assessing PSA performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a pooled analysis, the estimated sensitivity of a PSA cutoff of 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> was 21 percent for detecting any prostate cancer and 51 percent for detecting high-grade cancers (Gleason &ge;8). Using a cutoff of 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> increased these sensitivities to 32 and 68 percent, respectively. The estimated specificity was 91 percent for a PSA cutoff of 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and 85 percent for a 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> cutoff. PSA has poorer discriminating ability in men with symptomatic BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive predictive value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The test performance statistic that has been best characterized by screening studies is the positive predictive value: the proportion of men with an elevated PSA who have prostate cancer.</p><p>Overall, the positive predictive value for a PSA level &gt;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is approximately 30 percent, meaning that slightly less than one in three men with an elevated PSA will have prostate cancer detected on biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/45,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,51,52</a>].

The proportion of organ-confined cancers is lower, less than 50 percent, for PSA values above 10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7597682\"><span class=\"h3\">Negative predictive value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, which biopsied men with normal PSA levels, estimated a negative predictive value of 85 percent for a PSA value &le;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer#H98462141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemoprevention strategies in prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Finasteride: PCPT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of lowering PSA cutoffs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some investigators have suggested using a lower PSA cutoff because some men with PSA levels below 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and normal digital rectal examinations are found to have prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>].</p><p>In a subset analysis from the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, 449 of 2950 men (15.2 percent) ages 62 to 91 years who had consistently normal PSA levels and digital rectal examinations during the seven years of annual screening had prostate cancer on an end-of-study biopsy; overall, seven (1.6 percent of cancers) had high-grade prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 8 or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Among the 675 men with a PSA concentration between 2.1 and 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> 167 (24.7 percent) had prostate cancer, and four (3.5 percent of cancers) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 8 or higher.</p><p>These observations indicate that there is not a clear cutpoint between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; PSA levels. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial found that for biopsies performed during follow-up in the control group even a PSA cutoff of 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> would miss 17 percent of cancers, including 5 percent of poorly differentiated cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Thus, any choice of PSA cutoff involves a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. While lowering the PSA cutoff would improve test sensitivity, a lower PSA cutoff would also reduce specificity, leading to far more false-positive tests and unnecessary biopsies. It has been projected that if the PSA threshold were to be lowered to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> the number of men defined as abnormal would double, to up to six million in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Additionally, many of the cancers detected at these lower levels may never have become clinically evident, thereby leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Serial PSA measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both detection rates and positive predictive values decline substantially with serial testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-65</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During four rounds of annual PSA screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, the number of cancers detected per 1000 men decreased from 14.2 to 9.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

The investigators selected an optimal cutoff of 25 percent as a criterion for biopsy, which would have reduced the number of unnecessary biopsies by 20 percent in their study cohort. However, men with a normal free-to-total PSA ratio still had an 8 percent probability of having cancer, which may not be low enough to convince patients and clinicians to forego biopsy. A meta-analysis came to similar conclusions that free-to-total PSA ratio is generally only clinically helpful at extreme values of the ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>A separate meta-analysis of free PSA noted considerable variability in free PSA assays, specimen handling, cutoffs, and patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

This study used different recruiting and randomization procedures across seven centers in Europe. The study used PSA cutoffs between 2.5 and 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (most centers used a cutoff of 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> as indications for referral for biopsy, variably supplemented with digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasonography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> measurements of free PSA levels. The overall rate of prostate cancer screening in the control group was not reported, though 31 percent of cancers were categorized as stage T1c (diagnosed based on elevated PSA level).

The absolute rates of prostate cancer mortality were 0.43 versus 0.54 per 1000 person-years (absolute rate difference of 0.11 fewer deaths per 1000 person-years; 781 (95% CI 490-1929) men needed to be invited for screening to prevent one prostate cancer death over 13 years). Prostate cancer was diagnosed more frequently in the screening group (9.6 versus 6.2 cases per 1000 person-years), such that 27 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be detected by screening to prevent one death from prostate cancer after 13 years. All-cause mortality in the core group was not reduced with screening (18.6 versus 18.9 deaths per 1000 person-years; rate ratio 1.00, CI 0.98-1.02). Prostate cancer mortality was also reduced in the entire cohort of men ages 50 to 74 (rate ratio 0.83, CI 0.73-0.94).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the absolute mortality benefit for screening was low, several factors could have biased the results toward no effect. Approximately 24 percent of subjects invited for screening did not undergo PSA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While not definitively characterized, a substantial proportion of the control group likely received PSA testing (31 percent of cancers were screening-detected). A subsequent analysis of the Rotterdam site data used patient surveys and linkages with a central national laboratory to estimate contamination. Adjusting for contamination and non-adherence with screening, investigators estimated that prostate cancer screening could reduce prostate cancer mortality by as much as 31 percent (95% CI 8-49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Additionally, at least 25 percent of cancers detected in the screening group did not receive curative treatment with either surgery or radiation. Finally, given the indolent course of prostate cancer and the 5- to 10-year lead time associated with PSA testing, follow-up duration may have been insufficient to accurately estimate the survival benefit. However, the absolute rate difference has dropped only from 0.06 fewer prostate cancer deaths per 1000 person-years after nine years of follow-up to the 13-year rate of 0.11 fewer deaths per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, while the prostate cancer survival benefit from screening was not initially realized until nine years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], the burdens of screening and treatment, including harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment, occur immediately and potentially have lifelong consequences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several biases could also have favored the screening group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. A higher proportion of high-risk cancers diagnosed in the screening group were aggressively treated (surgery or radiation) compared with the control group, so some of the outcome differences could be related more to improved treatment than screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Among Rotterdam Site men treated with radical prostatectomy, those in the screening group were less likely than those in the control group to experience biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.83), and metastasis (HR 0.18, CI 0.06-0.59); prostate cancer mortality was also reduced, but the finding was not statistically significant with only 12 men dying from prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Additionally, the committee adjudicating cause of death was aware of cancer treatments. Previous studies have suggested that cause of death is less likely to be attributed to prostate cancer for patients who received aggressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

In 2014, investigators reported 18-year follow-up data for what they called a study of &quot;organized&quot; PSA screening compared with &quot;opportunistic testing&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Cumulative prostate cancer mortality rates were still lower in the screening group than in the control group (0.98 versus 1.5 percent, reflecting 43 fewer deaths). The G&ouml;teborg study, which used population registries to randomly allocate men to either the screening or control groups, could plausibly be more likely to demonstrate benefit than the other ERSPC sites because it offered screening every two years (versus every four years). Additionally, the G&ouml;teborg results were based on a cohort of men ages 50 to 64 compared with ages 55 to 69 in the combined ERSPC report. This suggests that screening may be less beneficial for men &ge;65 years, consistent with the finding that radical prostatectomy did not confer a survival benefit compared with watchful waiting for men in this age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. However, experts have questioned these explanations because mortality rates among younger ERSPC subjects were very low, as was the rate of interval cancers, suggesting that including younger subjects and screening more frequently would not account for the observed mortality differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The Goteborg finding could also be due to chance; the 95% CI for the rate ratio overlapped the 0.79 rate ratio reported by ERSPC.

Over 40 percent of study subjects had undergone PSA testing within three years before enrolling in the trial, and subsequent analyses estimated that more than 80 percent of control subjects underwent PSA testing during the study (contamination) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to the ERSPC, after seven years of follow-up there was no reduction in the primary outcome of prostate cancer mortality (50 versus 44 deaths in the screening and control groups, respectively; rate ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.75-1.70) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cancer detection in the screening group was significantly higher than in the control group (2820 versus 2322, rate ratio 1.22, CI 1.16-1.29). A subsequent publication looking at longer-term follow-up within the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial found similar prostate cancer mortality results (RR 1.04, CI 0.87-1.24) with no suggestion of reduced overall mortality in the patients followed for a median of 14.8 years (RR 0.98, CI 0.95-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This suggests that the differences in results between the ERSPC and the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial were not related to the duration of follow-up. Additionally, the investigators found no evidence that screening could be beneficial in any subgroups defined by comorbidity, age, or pretrial PSA testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The negative results are most likely attributable to the very high rate of PSA testing in the control arm, which has been estimated as high as 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>], and to the high proportion of subjects with recent PSA testing at baseline (because serial testing is associated with finding fewer and less aggressive cancers). An earlier PLCO Cancer Screening Trial publication also indicated that substantial proportions of men with abnormal PSA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DRE results had not undergone biopsy within three years following the positive screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Screening with PSA with or without DRE compared with no screening did not reduce death from prostate cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.71-1.09). However, screening significantly increased the probability of cancer diagnosis (RR 1.46, CI 1.21-1.77). In a 2011 Cochrane meta-analysis that had similar findings, the estimated prostate cancer-specific mortality difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.07), but cancer was diagnosed significantly more often in men randomized to screening (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence from observational studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before publication of the randomized trials, other data had been cited to support the effectiveness of screening.

However, treatment advancements may have also contributed to the declining mortality rates.</p><p>The ERSPC investigators used simulation models based on their data and observational studies reporting quality of life outcomes to project lifetime numbers of cancer diagnoses, treatments, deaths, and quality-adjusted life years gained after PSA screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. Overall, annual screening between ages 55 to 69 would result in nine fewer prostate cancer deaths per 1000 men followed for an entire lifetime, with a total of 73 life-years gained. Investigators projected that 98 men would need to be screened and five cancers detected to prevent one prostate cancer death. However, after adjusting for the adverse effects of screening, PSA screening resulted in a gain of only 56 quality-adjusted life-years, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 97 life-years gained to 21 life-years lost.

ESMO further states that there is inconsistent evidence on screening men younger than 50 and between 70 and 75 years of age, and evidence that the harms of screening outweigh the benefits for men over age 75.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians (ACP) produced a &quot;guidance statement&quot; in 2013 based on their rigorous review of guidelines developed by other United States organizations, including the American College of Preventive Medicine, the ACS, the AUA, and the USPSTF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>]. The ACP guidance statement recommends that clinicians inform men ages 50 to 69 about the limited potential benefits and substantial harms of prostate cancer screening and only screen men who express a clear preference for being screened. The guidance statement also recommends against screening for prostate cancer in average-risk men under the age of 50 and against screening in men over the age of 69 or with a life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend discussing the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening beginning at age 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. PSA testing should be offered to men willing to be screened; a baseline DRE could also be considered, particularly for men with elevated PSA values.

Given limitations in the design and reporting of the randomized trials, there remain important concerns that the benefits of screening are outweighed by the potential harms to quality of life, including the substantial risks for overdiagnosis and treatment complications. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because individual patient preferences for specific health outcomes are a deciding factor in determining whether to screen for prostate cancer, men who are potential candidates for screening should be engaged in discussions or decision-making processes that inform them and evoke these preferences. Using decision aids may help ensure that patients receive consistent, complete, and objective information and may optimize time. Summary points suggested by the American Cancer Society (ACS) are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Informed decision-making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care providers should periodically discuss prostate cancer screening with men who are expected to live at least 10 years and are old enough to be at significant risk for prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Age to begin screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In average-risk men, we suggest that discussions begin at age 50 years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In men at high risk for prostate cancer, we suggest that discussions begin at age 40 to 45 years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). High-risk men include black men; men with a family history of prostate cancer, particularly in relatives younger than age 65; and men who are known or likely to have the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutations. While these men who are at increased risk may be more likely to benefit from screening, there is relatively little evidence addressing this and these men should be informed that the potential benefits and risks of early screening are uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a decision is made to screen, we suggest that screening be performed with PSA tests at intervals ranging from every two to four years (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest not performing digital rectal examination (DRE) as part of screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Frequency and method of screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a decision is made to screen, we suggest that screening stop after age 69 or earlier when comorbidities limit life expectancy to less than 10 years, or the patient decides against further screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Stopping screening at age 65 may be appropriate if the PSA level is less than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men with an abnormal DRE (if performed) or PSA level above 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> should be referred, without further testing, to a urologist who can evaluate them for a prostate biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Referrals to urology to evaluate abnormal results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that men with a PSA level between 4 and 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> undergo repeat testing several weeks later (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Prior to repeat PSA testing, men should abstain from ejaculation and bike riding for at least 48 hours. Men with symptomatic prostatitis should be treated with antibiotics before retesting. Men with a repeat PSA level above 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> should be referred to a urologist who can evaluate them for a prostate biopsy.
