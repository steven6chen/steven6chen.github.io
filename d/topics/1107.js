It happens when the brain is damaged in some way, usually because of a stroke.</p><p>There are different types of aphasia. Some types affect a person's ability to understand speech or to read. Other types affect a person's ability to form speech or to write. There are many different types of aphasia. Just a few examples are listed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Broca's aphasia</strong> (also called &quot;non-fluent aphasia&quot; or &quot;expressive aphasia&quot;) &ndash; People with this type of aphasia can understand a lot of what is said but they have trouble speaking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wernicke's aphasia</strong> (also called &quot;fluent aphasia&quot;) &ndash; People with this type of aphasia can form speech but have trouble understanding it. They produce a lot of speech that doesn't make sense and sometimes use made-up words. Doctors sometimes call this &quot;word salad.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Global aphasia</strong> &ndash; People with global aphasia cannot speak or understand written or spoken language.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anomic aphasia</strong> &ndash; People with this type of aphasia have trouble naming specific objects. They might still be able to speak and use verbs, but they cannot recall what different things are called.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alexia</strong> &ndash; People with this type of aphasia lose the ability to read. They cannot understand written words. Most people who have this problem have other problems understanding language, too. Alexia does not usually happen on its own.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5631449\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes aphasia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of aphasia is a stroke. But other types of brain damage can cause aphasia, too. For example, people can develop aphasia after a head injury or because of a brain tumor. There is also a disorder that gradually damages the brain over time and causes a type of aphasia called &quot;primary progressive aphasia.&quot;</p><p>The type of aphasia a person develops depends a lot on which portion of the brain is damaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5631464\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have aphasia, your doctor will do tests to find out exactly what parts of language you have trouble with. He or she will test your ability to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speak and understand speech</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read and write</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat tricky words or phrases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solve riddles or word problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Describe scenes or name objects</p><p/><p>You might also need imaging tests, such as MRIs or CT scans, to check what parts of your brain were affected by your stroke (or whatever is causing your aphasia). Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5631479\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I regain my ability to use or understand language?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with aphasia can often re-learn how to speak or at least how to communicate to some degree.</p><p>If you develop aphasia, you will probably need to work with a speech and language therapist. He or she can give you exercises to do to help you recover.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5631494\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the chances of a full recovery from aphasia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chances of making a full recovery depend on a lot of factors, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much of the brain was damaged and what caused the damage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What part of the brain was damaged</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How soon the person was treated following the damage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5631509\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=recovery-after-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Recovery after stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysarthria-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysarthria (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lowering-the-risk-of-having-another-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lowering the risk of having another stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-an-ischemic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after an ischemic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-ischemic-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Transient ischemic attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
