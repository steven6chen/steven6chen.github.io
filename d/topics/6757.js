The deficits must represent a decline from previous level of function and be severe enough to interfere with daily function and independence.</p><p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in older adults, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of cases. As the population ages, the overall burden of dementia is increasing worldwide. With an aging population and growing awareness of AD and other late-life dementias, primary care clinicians should be equipped to test for cognitive impairment and ask about functional decline to avoid failure to recognize cases of AD and related dementias. Clinicians will need to accurately diagnose and manage the early cognitive manifestations of AD and other dementias. They should also be prepared to answer questions about current treatments, noting that currently available treatments have had generally disappointing results in actually improving cognition in patients with AD and related dementias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia. An approach to diagnosis and evaluation of early-onset dementia (ie, adults younger than 65 years of age) is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-onset-dementia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early-onset dementia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical, diagnostic, and pathologic aspects of specific dementia syndromes and the treatment, risk factors, and prevention of dementia are also discussed separately.

According to DSM-5, released in 2013, the criteria for dementia (now called major neurocognitive disorder) include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence from the history and clinical assessment that indicates significant cognitive impairment in at least one of the following cognitive domains:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Learning and memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Language</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Executive function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complex attention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perceptual-motor function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Social cognition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impairment must be acquired and represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cognitive deficits must interfere with independence in everyday activities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the case of neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer disease (AD), the disturbances are of insidious onset and are progressive, based on evidence from the history or serial mental-status examinations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disturbances are not occurring exclusively during the course of delirium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disturbances are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (eg, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia)</p><p/><p>Prior versions of the DSM definition have had good to very good reliability for the diagnosis of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The DSM-5 definition differs substantively from prior versions in that the cognitive domains have been renamed and expanded to include social cognition and complex attention; in addition, the centrality of memory dysfunction as a sine qua non has been deemphasized, with all six cognitive domains given equal weight in the criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276 \">table 1</a>). All previous DSM definitions of dementia listed memory as an essential feature for the diagnosis. The change from DSM-IV to DSM-5 presumably reflects the problem that some individuals with dementia due to causes other than AD did not meet definitional criteria because memory function was intact or at least relatively intact compared with norms. That being said, for the most common forms of dementia, memory and language dysfunction are generally always present. The performance of the DSM-5 criteria in relation to prior versions is not yet known, but it is likely that the changes will have some impact on research and possibly clinical practice in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detecting dementia is a common problem in routine, day-to-day medical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. One study found that the diagnosis was missed in 21 percent of demented or delirious patients on a general medical ward, while 20 percent of nondemented patients were misjudged as demented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nonetheless, the clinical diagnosis of dementia is reasonably accurate for those with experience in the evaluation of this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63701 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most patients with dementia do not present with a complaint of memory loss; it is often a spouse or other informant who brings the problem to the clinician's attention. Self-reported memory loss does not appear to correlate with the subsequent development of dementia, while informant-reported memory loss is a much better predictor of the current presence and future development of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Nevertheless, family members are often delayed in recognizing the signs of dementia, many of which are inaccurately ascribed to &quot;aging.&quot;</p><p>The normal cognitive decline associated with aging consists primarily of mild changes in memory and the rate of information processing; these are generally not very progressive and usually do not affect daily function before onset of progression to actual dementia. In a study of 161 community-dwelling, cognitively normal individuals ages 62 to 100 years, learning or acquisition performance declined uniformly with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, delayed recall or forgetting remained relatively stable. Similarly, a second report found that aging was associated with decline in learning of new information but not in memory retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Patients with dementia may have difficulty with one or more of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retaining new information (eg, trouble remembering events)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Handling complex tasks (eg, balancing a checkbook)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reasoning (eg, unable to cope with unexpected events)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spatial ability and orientation (eg, getting lost in familiar places)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language (eg, word finding)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior</p><p/><p>Patients and informants are often uncertain about the onset of symptoms since the appearance of dementia is insidious. By the time the patient has stopped driving or managing finances, the disease has often been present for a few years. Useful questions for the patient and informant are, &quot;When did you first notice the memory loss?&quot; and &quot;How has the memory loss progressed since then?&quot;</p><p>The diagnosis of dementia must be distinguished from delirium and depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51421 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of late-life unipolar depression&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delirium is usually acute or subacute in onset and is associated with a clouding of the sensorium; patients have fluctuations in their level of consciousness and have difficulty maintaining attention and concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F103327\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103327 \">table 4</a>). Delirium and dementia can overlap, making the distinction difficult and sometimes impossible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with depression are more likely to complain about memory loss than those with dementia; the latter are frequently brought to clinicians by their families, while depressed patients often present by themselves. Patients with depression may have signs of psychomotor slowing and give poor effort on testing (&quot;I just can't do this&quot;), while those with dementia often try hard but respond with incorrect answers. It is important to ask the test administrator to estimate the effort given by the patient. Depression and dementia may occur in the same patient.</p><p/><p>The pretest probability of dementia and of various causes of dementia depends upon patient characteristics such as age and race. Realizing that 5 percent of individuals over age 65 years and 35 to 50 percent of persons over age 85 years have dementia, the pretest probability of dementia in an older person with reported memory loss is estimated to be at least 60 percent.</p><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for dementia in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

The prevalence of VaD is relatively high in blacks, hypertensive persons, and patients with diabetes; some of the reversible dementias (eg, metabolic dementias) tend to occur in younger individuals. DLB may be as prevalent as VaD in older cohorts of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. FTD is much less common than AD or VaD.</p><p>Less common etiologies include alcohol-related dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other central nervous system illnesses (eg, prion diseases, HIV infection).

In addition, medical illnesses and comorbidities exacerbating poor cognition are common in older adult patients with dementia. The bedside evaluation combined with historical information from a reliable informant provides most of the information needed to ascertain the cause of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, even with the addition of information from imaging studies, current clinical criteria for VaD have relatively poor sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], likely because of so-called &quot;mixed dementias.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial appointment in a patient with suspected dementia should focus upon the history. Family members or someone who knows the patient well must be available to give an adequate history of cognitive and behavioral changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In some cases, it may be necessary to interview the informant alone to get a complete story, but in general, the key is to have an informant to learn the complete history. A drug history is particularly important; use of drugs that impair cognition (eg, analgesics, anticholinergics, psychotropic medications, and sedative-hypnotics) should be sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>A full dementia evaluation probably cannot be completed in a routine 30-minute visit; adequate time should be arranged in a follow-up appointment. The initial step at the follow-up visit is an assessment of cognitive function. This should be followed by a complete physical examination, including neurologic examination. The subsequent work-up may include laboratory and imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV and DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Identification of the underlying etiologic subtype (eg, Alzheimer dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], etc) is discussed within separate topics, as summarized above. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dementia syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cognitive complaints should undergo a careful mental status examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Agreement between the history and the mental status examination is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of dementia. When the history suggests cognitive impairment but the mental status examination is normal, possible explanations include mild dementia, high intelligence or education, depression, or, rarely, misrepresentation on the part of the informants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Conversely, when the mental status examination suggests cognitive impairment but the family and patient deny any problems, possible explanations include an acute confusional state, very low intelligence or education, or inadequate recognition by the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Neuropsychological assessment (psychometric testing) may be useful in difficult situations; repeated clinical assessments over time are often the most helpful tool.</p><p>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and other brief screening tests for dementia have a pooled sensitivity of 75 to 92 percent and a specificity of 81 to 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although the proprietary MMSE is the most widely studied, many other screening tests have similar performance and are freely available. Importantly, any selected test must be considered in the context of an individual patient and knowledge of their previous baseline &quot;normal&quot; function; no single cutpoint applied to all patients will perform well in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Mini-Mental State Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MMSE has been the most widely used cognitive test for dementia in United States clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], although patent protection has led to increased use of other bedside exams. The MMSE takes approximately seven minutes to complete. It tests a broad range of cognitive functions including orientation, recall, attention, calculation, language manipulation, and constructional praxis. While not designed specifically to assess late-life neurodegenerative dementias, it has become a common language for clinicians until a better, simpler, or shorter test is developed.</p><p>The maximum score on the MMSE is 30 points. A score of less than 24 points is suggestive of dementia or delirium. Using a cutoff of 24 points, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 87 percent and a specificity of 82 percent in a large hospital-based sample (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63701 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the test is not sensitive for mild dementia, and scores may be influenced by age and education, as well as language, motor, and visual impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one community-based study, for example, the median MMSE score was 29 for individuals with at least nine years of schooling, 26 for those with five to eight years of schooling, and 22 for those with four years of schooling or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The pattern of missed questions can be as important as the overall score; if the clinical deficit is memory loss, a person may miss all three objects on delayed recall and score 27, which for that individual would be a false-negative result if a cutoff of 24 is being used.</p><p>The use of higher cutoff scores on the MMSE improves sensitivity but lowers specificity. For research purposes, some investigators use a cutoff score of 26 or 27 in symptomatic populations in order to not miss many true cases, while lower cutoffs would be necessary in populations where the expected prevalence is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Age-specific norms also have been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; some groups have developed tools that incorporate age, gender, and education level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79818\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79818 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>The MMSE also has utility in assessing decision-making capacity but is not a substitute for an assessment of capacity. While low scores (eg, &lt;16 out of 30 points) in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) are highly correlated with impaired capacity, higher scores may or may not correlate with full capacity to make decisions.

Changes of two points or less are of uncertain clinical significance as they may represent measurement error, regression to the mean, or a practice effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2232652445\"><span class=\"h3\">Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief screening test designed to detect cognitive impairment in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Neuropsychological instruments that emphasize memory function were considered most useful.

However, no single item on the panel has high discriminatory ability, and the pattern of performance on various domains must be interpreted in conjunction with the history, neuroimaging studies, and other testing to arrive at a presumptive etiologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Follow-up testing generally provides more helpful information than a single study, particularly when results are equivocal, in that evidence of decline can predict future decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

A number of guidelines on the clinical evaluation of dementia have been published, many of which do not recommend imaging studies routinely, but include clinical prediction rules to identify patients who might have reversible causes of dementia that can be diagnosed with imaging studies (eg, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus, treatable cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/2,65,70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,65,70-76</a>]. The prediction rules vary, including factors such as younger age (&lt;60 years), focal signs, and short duration of symptoms (less than two years), among others.

Our practice is to order imaging when patients present with unusual or atypical findings or when imaging findings may be reassuring for patients and families. Such differences in practice may be attributable to the context in which the patient is seen. Neurologists, who may only see a person once or for a very limited time period, will usually obtain imaging on a patient referred from primary care, whereas clinicians in primary care usually have the advantage of serial observations over time in patients known to them and will more frequently look for atypical signs or symptoms before ordering structural imaging.</p><p>MRI findings in AD include both generalized and focal atrophy as well as white matter lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].
