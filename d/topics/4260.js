Sleep deficiency arising from any cause results in reduced alertness, impaired performance, and compromised health. Acute and chronic sleep deficiency result in measurable changes in cognitive performance, alertness, behavioral function, and emotional regulation, and these effects are particularly apparent in children. Susceptibility to such changes varies among individuals and is based on multiple factors including age, circadian preference, and genetic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. More recently, the range of sleep durations required by children at different ages was reviewed and summarized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Slow-wave sleep (SWS) appears to be the most &quot;restorative&quot; form of sleep and thus is preferentially preserved in the face of insufficient total sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep also plays fundamental roles, and is involved in cognitive functions such as the consolidation of memory and learning of new tasks. Both forms of sleep appear to play an integral role in the growth and development of the central nervous system. </p><p>This topic review will describe the clinical consequences of sleep deficiency and their manifestations in specific sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia.

Many studies have demonstrated that sleep restriction impairs children's ability to respond quickly and accurately on neuropsychological measures of attention, including computerized performance tests, and leads to errors both of omission (failing to respond when a signal is present) and commission (responding when a signal is absent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The ability to work both accurately and efficiently is compromised, as individuals operating under conditions of sleep loss may arrive at the correct answer, but take a longer amount of time to do so, significantly impairing tasks that require speed and accuracy (eg, taking a standardized test, driving a car, or crossing a busy street). Moreover, the more complex the task, the greater the impact of sleep disruption. For example, children with fragmented sleep or with sleep loss experienced under experimental conditions show more performance deficits on more complex cognitive tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Conversely, extending sleep above baseline by as little as 30 minutes in healthy children has been found to result in significant improvement on computerized tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053954\"><span class=\"h2\">Executive functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep loss selectively impairs complex cognitive or &quot;executive&quot; functions (eg, time management, decision making, organization, selective attention, judgment, motivation, self-monitoring and modifying behavior, predicting outcomes, problem-solving, planning, multitasking, impulse control, and emotional regulation). This is suggested by functional neuroimaging studies in adults and children, which indicate that sleep loss selectively impacts the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where these executive functions reside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similarly, numerous experimental studies over more than 30 years have documented the effects of short-term sleep restriction and deprivation on executive functions in adults. More recently, studies in young children, school-aged children, and adolescents have shown similar findings of impairments in executive functions under conditions of experimental sleep manipulation, and also documented the impact on related complex tasks such as classroom performance and simulated driving. In addition to short-term impact of insufficient or poor quality sleep on attention and executive functions, there may be longer-term consequences as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For example, studies have shown that parent-reported sleep problems in school-aged children are associated with lower scores on neuropsychological tests and specifically on executive functions in adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053960\"><span class=\"h2\">Memory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep is now known to be an active process that is crucial for organizing and selectively retaining salient information; in particular, reactivation and reorganization of memory after learning occurs during sleep. Both SWS and REM sleep play active and important roles in regard to memory, particularly memory consolidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. REM sleep may be particularly important for emotional memory processing and consolidating motor skills, while SWS has an important role in consolidating learning about facts and knowledge.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that a period of sleep after learning a new task facilitates memory consolidation in children, and that parent-reported &quot;poor&quot; sleep and decreased sleep duration are associated with memory consolidation deficits, particularly poorer verbal working memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, day-to-day memory and other cognitive performance measure fluctuations in children may be linked to changes in sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">quality/quantity</span> and daytime sleepiness. Finally, several studies have documented the salutary effect of a daytime nap in young children on cognitive performance, including memory consolidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053966\"><span class=\"h2\">Academic performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the consequences listed above on a variety of cognitive functions, it is no surprise that disrupted sleep is associated with an overall decline in academic functioning; this relationship has been described in a number of studies assessing the impact of sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H16053990\" class=\"local\">'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a> below). There also appears to be a relationship between the degree of sleep restriction and worse academic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some evidence suggests that higher sleep <strong>efficiency</strong> (time <span class=\"nowrap\">asleep/time</span> in bed), a measure of sleep consolidation, rather than sleep <strong>duration</strong>, is associated with better academic performance in typically developing school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Moreover, studies have suggested that good sleep quality is associated with ancillary domains related to school performance in students, such as greater receptivity to the teacher, improved student self-image, and enhanced motivation to achieve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053972\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotional regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala (which is sometimes called the &quot;emotional brain&quot;) participate in generating and regulating emotional responses. The neural connections between the PFC and amygdala are also vital. As an example, neuroimaging studies suggest that both anxiety disorders and depression in adolescents are characterized by dysfunctional and low levels of connectivity between these two brain regions. </p><p>Sleep loss appears both to impair emotional regulation in the amygdala and PFC and to disrupt the connections between these regions. This has been shown by functional neuroimaging studies in which sleep-restricted (adult) volunteers viewed emotional images and demonstrated an increased uptake (response) in the amygdala combined with a weaker connection between the amygdala and the PFC, implying a heightened emotional response with less emotional control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Sleep loss impacts the level of emotional reactivity, the ability to regulate both positive and negative emotions, and the ability to accurately assess emotional reactions in others. These are obviously very important functions in children and adolescents as they learn to navigate increasingly complex emotional and social situations. REM sleep may play a particularly important role in emotional functioning and in the processing and retention of emotional memories. </p><p>Sleep loss is associated with mood disturbances, including complaints of moodiness, irritability, emotional lability, increased negative emotions, depression, and anger. As examples, numerous studies in adolescents have reported a correlation between sleep loss and self-reported feelings of unhappiness, sadness or depression, hopelessness about the future, anxiety, a negative view of life, and self-harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. This relationship is bidirectional, in that poor sleep is more common in children and adolescents who are diagnosed with anxiety and mood disorders. An association has been reported in several studies of adolescents between suicidal thoughts and disrupted sleep. </p><p>In addition to sleep loss, disruption of normal circadian rhythms (eg, by &quot;all-nighters&quot; or early high school start times), is also related to mood dysregulation. Interventions that result in increased sleep duration, such as delaying middle and high school start times, are also associated with improvements in mood as well as increased academic engagement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Similarly, intrinsic circadian rhythm &quot;preferences&quot; or orientation, specifically a tendency towards &quot;eveningness&quot; (later bedtimes and wake times) versus &quot;morningness&quot; (earlier bedtimes and wake times), is associated with greater risk of depression and mood disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053978\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motor hyperactivity is one of the most consistently reported symptoms in a number of sleep disorders, particularly in younger children, and may be construed as a behavioral compensation for an internal sense of sleepiness (in an attempt to remain awake), compounded by behavioral dysregulation. Accordingly, there is an overlap between sleep disorders including OSA and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as noted below. (See <a href=\"#H16053990\" class=\"local\">'Sleep-related breathing disorders'</a> below.) </p><p>Sleep loss promotes risk-taking and sensation-seeking behavior. A number of studies, including some in adolescents, have suggested that insufficient sleep is linked to changes in reward-related decision-making, so that sleep-deprived individuals tend to take greater risks and are less concerned about the potential negative consequences of their behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. These effects are mediated through the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens), which is part of the basal ganglia and is particularly important for motivation and reward-related function. Risk behaviors during adolescence, such as using drugs, driving while impaired, or self-harm behaviors, depend on a complex relationship between risk perception, assessment of the <span class=\"nowrap\">cost/benefit</span> ratio of risky behaviors, and reward salience. &#160;</p><p>Daytime behavioral disinhibition, including oppositional, defiant and aggressive behavior, and noncompliance as reported by teachers and parents, has been associated with disordered sleep in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Sleepy school children more often show bullying behavior and receive discipline referrals compared with their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, it is important to recognize that while children with poor quality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insufficient sleep demonstrate more problematic behavior, the converse may also be true. For example, an average of 30 minutes of sleep extension in school-aged children was reported to be associated with improvements in students' emotional lability and <span class=\"nowrap\">restless/impulsive</span> behavior as rated by their teachers, and with decreased aggressive and oppositional behavior in school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The behavioral effects of sleep loss may be further exacerbated by &quot;weekend oversleep.&quot; This phenomenon is common among teens who are exposed to chronic sleep loss during the week and who attempt to compensate by shifting bed and wake times later and extending sleep on weekends, causing progressive disruption of circadian rhythms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053984\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC SLEEP DISORDERS THAT MAY AFFECT COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence and types of sleep problems that occur throughout childhood must be understood in the context of normal development. As examples, separation anxiety in toddlers may be associated with increased bedtime problems; normal fears in preschoolers may result in nighttime fears and night wakings; and the relative prominence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy in early childhood is partly responsible for the relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this age group. Parental perception and reporting of sleep problems in children also varies across childhood, with caregivers of infants and toddlers more likely to be aware of sleep concerns than are caregivers of school-aged children and adolescents. Indeed, the very definition of a &quot;sleep problem&quot; by parents is often highly subjective and is commonly influenced by the amount of disruption caused to parents' sleep. </p><p>Data are sparse regarding the impact of interventions for pediatric sleep disorders on cognitive, mood, and behavioral outcomes, with the exception of studies focused on OSA and on behavioral insomnia in young children. Interventions for these disorders demonstrate a positive impact on sleep parameters. In addition, treatment for these disorders appears to have a positive impact on behavioral function and mood regulation, as well as academic performance, as discussed in the following sections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053990\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep-related breathing disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) are common in children and encompass nocturnal breathing abnormalities ranging from habitual snoring to OSA. The term OSA refers to periodic episodes of nocturnal airflow restriction (hypopneas) or obstruction (apneas). A polysomnogram (PSG) is required for a definitive diagnosis of OSA. Behavioral comorbidity was included in some of the first descriptions of pediatric OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], and is also emphasized in the consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10538280\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral and cognitive manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The behavioral and academic consequences of sleep loss described above, including problems with inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and irritability, may be the primary presenting complaints in children with SRBD, including primary snoring and OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Because parents may not associate these problems with sleep disorders, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion: children who present with behavioral, mood, attentional, or academic concerns should be systematically screened for nocturnal breathing symptoms suggestive of OSA, and risk factors for OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>OSA in children has been associated with neurobehavioral symptoms, with fairly good consistency over many studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. &quot;Externalizing&quot; behaviors are particularly frequent, including aggression, impulsivity, hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, and conduct problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. As an example, among two cohorts of children scheduled to undergo adenotonsillectomy exclusively or almost exclusively for suspected OSA, inattentive and disruptive behaviors were common; about 30 percent met diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Oppositional-defiant disorder and conduct disorder or related disruptive behavior such as bullying are also common comorbidities in pediatric SRBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/22,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,41</a>]. Other alterations include emotional dysregulation and &quot;internalizing&quot; behaviors such as irritability, mood instability, low frustration tolerance, <span class=\"nowrap\">depression/anxiety,</span> social withdrawal, and increased somatic complaints. &quot;Classic&quot; symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (eg, difficulty waking in the morning, falling asleep at inappropriate times, or increased napping) are common in adults with OSA. These symptoms tend to be less obvious in children, except among those who are obese or have severe SRBD, but symptoms can often be identified when families are asked directly about sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Sleepiness in children with OSA, as compared with controls, can also be documented objectively on Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>The evidence regarding the effect of OSA on cognition is less robust than for behavioral manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. A number of studies have suggested associations between OSA and impaired executive functions such as tasks involving reaction time, vigilance, and sustained and selective attention, including in otherwise healthy pediatric samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>], obese children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and those with underlying neurocognitive deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, other areas of impairment are not necessarily consistent across studies. Most studies have failed to find a dose-dependent relationship between pediatric OSA severity and the degree of cognitive (or behavioral) impairment. Some cognitive deficits, such as language delays and impairments in visual perception, motor functions, and memory, have been identified in very young children with only mild SRBD. For example, infants with persistent habitual snoring have been found to have lower scores on a standardized measure of <span class=\"nowrap\">infant/toddler</span> development (Bayley scores) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>It is likely that the association between OSA and behavioral or cognitive dysfunction in many studies may have been confounded by other factors that also increase the risk of cognitive impairment, including comorbid conditions (prematurity, asthma, obesity and co-occurrence with other sleep disorders); environmental and sociocultural influences (short sleep duration, exposure to secondhand smoke, and economic disadvantage); and genetic susceptibility (individual genetics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> African American race). In cross-sectional studies, the observed association between low levels of academic achievement and OSA may represent the combined influence of a number of these risk factors for impaired learning and attention. This makes confirmation in longitudinal studies, and especially randomized controlled trials, all the more important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10538286\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, there is robust evidence that treatment (adenotonsillectomy) for OSA has a positive impact on sleep parameters as measured by PSG. There is also moderate quality evidence that treatment in otherwise healthy school-aged children diagnosed with mild to moderate OSA has a significant and sustained impact on behavioral function, quality of life, and SRBD symptoms as rated by caregivers. In contrast, a sizeable randomized clinical trial of adenotonsillectomy versus watchful waiting with supportive care found little or no evidence, at seven months, that objective measures of attention and cognitive performance benefitted from adenotonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], and a systematic review that included this trial reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Observational studies have reported postoperative improvements in objective measures of sleepiness, impulsivity, inattention, cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/39,40,42,44,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,42,44,55</a>], or behavior as reported by parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The following studies of children who underwent adenotonsillectomy for OSA are illustrative: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a comparison of 78 school-aged children scheduled for adenotonsillectomy to 27 children scheduled for unrelated surgical care, the former showed higher baseline scores on measures for hyperactivity, inattention, and objectively assessed daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One year after adenotonsillectomy, no significant differences persisted between groups in these neurobehavioral measures. Twenty-eight percent of the children scheduled for adenotonsillectomy met diagnostic criteria for ADHD at baseline, and half of these no longer met ADHD criteria at follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent cohort of 81 children, 35 percent met diagnostic criteria at baseline for either ADHD or oppositional-defiant disorder, and the disruptive behavior disorder resolved after adenotonsillectomy in about two-thirds of these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Two months after adenotonsillectomy, the mean score had improved significantly. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are now a handful of studies suggesting that alternative treatment modalities for OSA in children, such as positive airway pressure therapy, may also have positive impacts on sleep parameters, sleepiness, executive function, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. These treatments are sometimes offered to children who are not eligible for, or only partially responsive to adenotonsillectomy, including some children with syndromic or neurodevelopmental disabilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Contrasting results were reported in a longitudinal study of 35 preschool-aged children diagnosed with SRBD, of whom 57 percent underwent adenotonsillectomy and the others were managed conservatively. Cognitive performance (intelligence quotient [IQ] and language comprehension) decreased or remained unchanged during follow-up, irrespective of whether SRBD resolved (either after adenotonsillectomy or spontaneously) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>Some of the most compelling evidence about neurobehavioral effects of OSA in children comes from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT), in which 464 children with OSA (mostly of mild to moderate severity) were randomized to receive early adenotonsillectomy versus watchful waiting for seven months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Though it was not designed as a population-based epidemiological study, CHAT did not show baseline differences in measures of attention and executive function between enrolled subjects and population means. These cognitive measures, which were the designated primary outcomes for the trial, also did not improve to different extents in the two study arms at follow-up. One reason for this finding may be that there was relatively little behavioral pathology at baseline. More detailed analysis of the wider range of secondary cognitive variables tested in CHAT has not yet been published.</p><p>In contrast, CHAT did confirm robust and significant improvements in several other key secondary outcomes, including parent- and teacher-reported measures of behavior, quality of life, OSA symptoms, and PSG findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Normalization of PSG findings was observed in 79 percent of children in the adenotonsillectomy group, with lower rates of normalization in African American and obese children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In the watchful waiting group, PSG normalization was also found in almost half (46 percent) of the subjects after seven months, but spontaneous resolution of symptoms such as inattention, hyperactive behavior, and sleepiness was much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. These findings indicate that adenotonsillectomy does have important benefits on behavioral symptoms associated with OSA. However, the improvement in controls also raises important questions about the indications for and efficacy of adenotonsillectomy for OSA. Careful observation without immediate surgical intervention may be warranted in some children. This study had the strengths of a randomized design and large, multicenter sample. It also had potential limitations due to overrepresentation of obese and minority children, whose surgical response may differ from that of other children; the limited duration of follow-up (seven months); and exclusion of children with severe OSA or with ADHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>An important unanswered question is whether children who snore, but do not qualify for a diagnosis of OSA based on PSG findings (ie, those with primary snoring), may still experience neurobehavioral consequences of their sleep-disordered breathing and potential benefits from adenotonsillectomy. Some children with primary snoring who do not meet PSG criteria for OSA undergo adenotonsillectomy because otolaryngologists often proceed to surgery for habitually snoring children without obtaining PSG first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], and as many as half of such children would not have OSA if tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/42,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,53</a>]. Cross-sectional data suggest that children with PSGs negative for OSA often still have the neurobehavioral morbidity seen in OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/42,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,65</a>]. These children experience neurobehavioral improvement after surgery, similar to the improvement seen in children with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/39,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,66</a>]. A randomized multicenter trial (Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Study [PATS]), is commencing to address these questions about children with primary snoring.</p><p>Other key questions relate to the long-term effects of OSA on behavior and cognition, and the efficacy and ideal timing of intervention to prevent such long-term effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that snoring very early in life is associated with behavioral symptoms or cognitive impairment later in childhood. As an example, one prospective cohort study found that snoring at baseline predicted new development of hyperactive behavior four years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective case-control study found that children in 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grades who performed poorly, compared with those who performed well, more often had a parent-reported history of snoring in early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Finally, in a large cohort study, children who snored or had other parent-reported symptoms of OSA during infancy or early childhood, and then had no such symptoms thereafter, still showed increased probability of having hyperactive behavior at ages four and seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. These findings raise the possibility that the earliest possible detection and treatment of OSA might be beneficial, but questions of when and how to accomplish this remain largely unanswered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patient selection could require a better understanding of the variability in the natural history of OSA or SRBD in untreated or partially treated children, and of potential variation among children in genetic susceptibility to neurobehavioral effects of these sleep disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16053996\"><span class=\"h2\">Restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restless legs syndrome (RLS; also called Willis-Ekbom disease, WED) is a common, complex, and treatable neurological condition that affects children as well as adults. A substantial body of literature about pediatric <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED</span> has emphasized its impact on sleep onset and sleep maintenance, as well as frequent co-occurrence with ADHD, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by clinical sleep disturbance and by repetitive limb jerking in sleep (known as periodic limb movements of sleep, PLMS). PLMD appears to be closely related to RLS, and often co-occurs with <span class=\"nowrap\">RLS/WED,</span> although they are distinct diagnostic entities.

Explicit symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (eg, difficulty waking in the morning or drowsiness) are relatively uncommon. The difficulty falling asleep and frequent nighttime awakenings associated with these disorders may also promote mood dysregulation and behavior problems, including mood problems, anxiety, and disruptive behavior. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a close association between ADHD or attentional difficulties and symptoms of RLS or PLMD. More than 40 percent of clinical samples of children with ADHD have RLS symptoms, and about 25 percent of pediatric patients with RLS have ADHD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. In children with both ADHD and RLS, the ADHD symptoms are typically more severe than in children with ADHD alone. Although the association between ADHD and sleep problems may reflect a reporting bias by caregivers, a meta-analysis of PSG studies in children with ADHD confirmed an increase in periodic limb movements of sleep in children with ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. There is also an increased risk for depression and anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents with RLS. One study found that 64 percent of pediatric patients with RLS had one or more comorbid psychiatric disorders: mood disturbances in 29 percent of patients, anxiety disorders in 12 percent of patients, and behavioral disturbances in 11 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Moreover, for children with ADHD it is helpful to inquire about symptoms of RLS, even if the child has no overt sleep complaints. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10538554\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a few studies in children and adolescents include any assessment of the impact of treatment of RLS on behavior, cognitive function and mood, and none of these were randomized clinical trials. Clinical case series and chart review studies have suggested that treatment with either supplemental iron, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a>, or dopaminergic agents may result in improved mood, and may reduce or eliminate ADHD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Preliminary results have suggested that there may be an important relationship between properties of psychotropic medication and pharmacogenomic factors in children and adolescents with symptoms of RLS, which may in turn impact treatment efficacy. For example, in children with RLS and comorbid depression and anxiety, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bupropion</a> is the preferred choice of antidepressant, rather than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which may exacerbate RLS.

In children, the sleep disturbance may manifest as resistance to going to bed at the appropriate time or difficulty sleeping without caregiver intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-insomnia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of insomnia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-disorders-resulting-in-problem-sleeplessness-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical disorders resulting in problem sleeplessness in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86998314\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral and cognitive manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insomnia in young children and adolescents has well-established effects on function and quality of life, and also places a significant burden on caregivers and the parent-child relationship. The clinical manifestations typically include observable alterations in behavior, mood, and cognitive functioning. A wealth of empirical evidence demonstrates that insufficient or interrupted sleep causes daytime sleepiness with significant impairment of performance and mood dysregulation (irritability, mood lability, more negative mood). As noted above, higher-level cognitive or &quot;executive&quot; functions such as decision making and problem solving appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of disturbed, insufficient, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> irregular sleep-wake patterns (see <a href=\"#H16053954\" class=\"local\">'Executive functions'</a> above). In addition, these types of sleep problems appear to be an important precursor and potential early indicator of later mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders (see <a href=\"#H16053972\" class=\"local\">'Emotional regulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16053978\" class=\"local\">'Behavior'</a> above). For example, insomnia seems to increase the risk of developing symptoms of conduct and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), major depressive disorder (MDD), ADHD, and social phobia in young school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>The association between sleep and cognitive and behavioral outcomes is bidirectional, in that sleep problems appear to exacerbate cognitive or behavioral symptoms, and vice-versa. This bidirectional causality is seen in several different groups of patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodevelopmental conditions &ndash; Children with underlying neurodevelopmental conditions, including intellectual disabilities, may be particularly vulnerable to developing sleep problems including insomnia, with accompanying impairments in mood, behavior, and cognition, compared with typically developing children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. For example, some of the core behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, eg, repetitive stereotypic behaviors, emotional dysregulation, self-stimulatory and self-injurious behaviors, poor communication skills, sensory integration deficits, unresponsiveness to social cues) may contribute to the genesis of sleep problems. Moreover, a number of psychosocial and environmental factors are likely to contribute to the high prevalence of severe sleep problems in these children, including learned maladaptive sleep patterns, inadequate parent limit setting, and increased parental awareness of sleep issues. Children and adolescents with ASD are also particularly prone to anxiety; thus, sleep problems related to separation anxiety, nighttime fears, and perseverative behaviors are commonly observed. Conversely, deficient sleep likely interferes with cognitive and behavioral function in these children, as it does in typically developing children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical approaches to sleep disturbance in individuals with ASD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Pharmacologic interventions&quot;, section on 'Sleep disturbance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental Health concerns &ndash; Virtually all psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents may cause sleep disruption, and sleep disruption can cause or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms. As a result of these bidirectional relationships, there is considerable overlap between symptoms of mental health disorders, such as mood dysregulation, inattentiveness, and disruptive behaviors, and features common to a wide range of sleep disorders, including sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-insomnia-in-adults#H513644283\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Psychiatric disorders'</a>). As examples: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ADHD appears to cause sleep problems, particularly difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Conversely, many of the most common behavioral consequences of insufficient or disrupted sleep in children mimic or exacerbate symptoms of ADHD (ie, problems with attention and focusing, hyperactivity, poor impulse control, irritability and disturbed mood, and disruptive behaviors such as oppositionality and aggression). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depression and anxiety disorders are commonly associated with insomnia. Conversely, insomnia is also a risk factor for the later development of these conditions. The interaction between sleep disturbances and symptoms of mood dysregulation and anxiety may pose a diagnostic dilemma because of the similarities in presenting symptoms. Studies suggest that 40 to 50 percent of these children have night wakings, nightmares, and difficulty waking in the morning, as reported by their parents. At the very least, poor sleep can exacerbate mood disorders, which may lead to additional sleep disturbances in a negative downward spiral. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10538513\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For typically developing young children, the positive impact on sleep from behavioral interventions for bedtime resistance and problematic night awakenings is well-established. In a number of these studies, improvements in mood and daytime behavior have been demonstrated as well. It is possible that some of these apparent improvements may reflect improvement in the caregivers' sleep and stress levels, which impact both caregivers' perceptions of their child's behavior and their parenting effectiveness. In addition, similar positive outcomes have been observed with behavioral interventions in special pediatric populations (eg, children with ADHD, anxiety and mood disorders, autism spectrum disorder [ASD], intellectual disabilities), demonstrating the robustness of behavioral interventions such as modified and unmodified extinction and positive routines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children#H3450031314\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;, section on 'Young children with behavioral insomnia'</a>.)</p><p>There is also an emerging literature on pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. Most of these studies are in children with neurological and developmental disorders and are focused on melatonin, usually in combination with behavioral interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. In general, melatonin seems effective in reducing sleep onset latency and is well-tolerated in children with ASD and ADHD, as well as typically-developing children; the vast majority of these studies have only assessed sleep parameters, although a handful have reported concomitant improvements in daytime variables such as behavior and parenting and family stress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-disorders-resulting-in-problem-sleeplessness-in-children#H11018979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical disorders resulting in problem sleeplessness in children&quot;, section on 'Neurologic and neurodevelopmental disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Pharmacologic interventions&quot;, section on 'Sleep disturbance'</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in adults is well established, but only a very few studies have assessed the impact of this strategy in typically-developing children and adolescents. Results thus far indicate that CBT-I can have positive effects on cognitive functions in adolescents, with notable improvements in visuospatial processing and phonological working memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Other studies have reported anecdotal improvements in daytime functioning, coping, and sense of well-being. CBT-I may also result in a decrease in symptom severity in children with psychiatric disorders such as depression who also have insomnia. Finally, in adolescents with sleep onset insomnia in the context of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, CBT-I plus bright light therapy has been shown to improve daytime functioning, including daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and depression symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16054008\"><span class=\"h2\">Narcolepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by excessive and irresistible sleepiness often associated with cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid dream-like imagery at sleep onset), and sleep paralysis (a momentary inability to move the body as one is drifting off to sleep or waking up). Although relatively rare in comparison to chronic insomnia or OSA, narcolepsy is one of the more common causes of disabling daytime sleepiness beginning in adolescence or early adulthood. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of this disorder are discussed in detail in separate topic reviews.

Patients with narcolepsy are more likely to have behavioral disturbances, depression, and problematic peer relationships. In a study of Swedish children developing narcolepsy after an H1N1 vaccination, over 40 percent of patients had at least one psychiatric comorbid condition, including ADHD in 29 percent, major depression in 20 percent, generalized anxiety disorder in 10 percent, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Behavioral dysregulation (ie, temper tantrums) were reported in the overwhelming majority (94 percent). Increased levels of depressive symptoms, largely associated with fatigue, have been reported to affect some 25 percent of children with narcolepsy, with girls older than 10 years of age being especially vulnerable, and depression also seems to be a major contributor to the decrease in overall quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>While most studies have found that children with narcolepsy do not have significant impairments in overall cognitive functioning (ie, IQ is within the normal range), specific learning and academic deficits have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In the Swedish study cited above, children with narcolepsy were found to have decreased verbal comprehension and working memory on neuropsychological tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cognitive-and-behavioral-consequences-of-sleep-disorders-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Due to the propensity for falling asleep in school and the attentional difficulties associated with narcolepsy, childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy represents a risk factor for subtle and heterogeneous cognitive impairments, which may result in academic failure.

Overt difficulty waking or drowsiness are relatively less common in children compared with adults. Treatment for OSA has a positive impact on sleep parameters as measured by polysomnography (PSG) and quality of life, and a number of studies have found that treatment has a significant and sustained positive impact on behavioral function and mood regulation, with potential, though less clearly demonstrated, benefit on cognitive functioning as well.

The relationship between sleep and cognitive and behavioral outcomes is inherently bidirectional. This is particularly apparent in children with neurodevelopmental conditions (eg, autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability) or mental health concerns (ADHD, depression, or anxiety). There is considerable empirical evidence that behavioral interventions for insomnia are effective for both typically-developing children and those with comorbid psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders, although in the latter group adjunctive pharmacotherapy may be warranted.
