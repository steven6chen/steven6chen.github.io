AIS encompasses a clinical continuum of decreased to absent androgen effects,<strong> </strong>varying from a completely female phenotype to a male phenotype with undervirilization or infertility. In contrast to the variability in phenotypic expression, the disorders have similar endocrine, pathophysiologic, and genetic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathophysiology will be reviewed here, while diagnosis and therapy are discussed separately.

Similar findings were described in patients with the less severe phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Involvement of the AR in these disorders was confirmed when the encoding gene was cloned and specific molecular defects were defined. The AR gene is located on chromosome Xq11-12. X-linkage of the AR gene was established when the human cDNA was cloned from an X-chromosome library [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The AR is a member of the steroid-thyroid-retinoid superfamily of nuclear receptors with a C-terminal region containing hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains and an N-terminal region important in transactivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61536 \">figure 1</a>). Specific mutations of the AR gene have been identified in many patients with androgen insensitivity syndromes (AIS). Most mutations today have been localized in the hormone-binding domain and, to a lesser extent, in the DNA-binding domain and the transactivation domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mutations in the 5' untranslated region of the AR gene have also been described, which impair AR function by reducing AR protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Androgen action via the AR leads to long-term programming effects by implementing stable functional and structural androgen-dependent traits. These occur during defined androgen-sensitive time windows of individual ontogenesis. Therefore, the AR acts in concert with many other co-factors to induce individual effects within each cell and organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], including the brain (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below). The AR is a transcriptional regulator, and cell-specific transcriptomes have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, a distinct class of AR mutation-negative patients with AIS have been described, in whom the AR-responsive target gene apolipoprotein D (APOD) is diminished in genital skin fibroblasts. The exact molecular defect in these patients has not been identified yet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21622961\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) may be as high as 1 in 20,000. In one study, it was the third most frequent cause of primary amenorrhea (after gonadal dysgenesis and congenital absence of the vagina) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. CAIS often presents in an adolescent or young adult woman seen for primary amenorrhea and found to have little or no axillary and pubic hair.</p><p>The clinical presentation may also be at birth or during infancy for inguinal masses (containing testes) or hernias in an otherwise healthy female child. More recently, female newborns have been diagnosed with CAIS when prenatal karyotyping identified a 46,XY karyotype. The labia and clitoris are unambiguous, and the vagina is short and blind ending (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91851 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Other features include normal-appearing testes, an absent uterus, and a 46,XY karyotype. In the newborn and infant, the laboratory diagnosis is quite difficult. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone basal levels may be low, and testosterone only increases after stimulation with exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. After puberty, if gonadectomy has not been performed, serum testosterone concentrations are in the high-normal to slightly elevated range for postpubertal boys, and estradiol levels are in the upper normal male reference range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The urogenital tract is characterized by absence or near absence of m&uuml;llerian structures; rarely, uterine remnants are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Epididymides and vasa deferentia are usually absent, but in one study, the epididymis and vas deferens were identified histologically adjacent to the testes in 10 of 33 affected children (average age six years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Germ cell tumors may develop in the cryptorchid testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but the risk of tumor development nowadays is seen as rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and early prophylactic gonadectomy is not recommended at this time. However, there is a risk of increasing tumor formation with age, so that patients should be followed closely and gonadectomy be performed postpubertally on an individualized basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Breast development is that of a typical woman, and overall body habitus is female. Axillary and pubic hair is markedly decreased or absent. Gender identity is mostly female; however, male gender identity has been described, demonstrating that gender identity only partially depends on early endocrine effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Many patients do not need any surgical procedures.

The various phenotypes were originally thought to be separate syndromes, and the recognition that they are due to defects of varying severity in androgen receptor (AR) function came from family studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

The external genitalia can exhibit partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clitoromegaly. As in CAIS, the vagina is short and ends blindly because m&uuml;llerian structures are absent. The testes are similar to those in CAIS in location and histology, but the Wolffian duct derivatives (epididymides, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts, as well as prostate) can be incompletely developed due to prenatal androgen effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346304813\"><span class=\"h3\">Predominantly male phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAIS with predominantly male phenotype is also referred to as mild androgen insensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91851 \">table 1</a>).

In adulthood, most males will be infertile due to impaired spermatogenesis. Axillary and pubic hair can be sparse to normal, and chest and facial hair are usually sparse or absent.

This mildest form of PAIS has been termed the infertile male syndrome. The external genitalia and internal urogenital tract are those of typical men. The overall body habitus is male, and facial and body hair growth is usually fully masculine. The testes are usually descended, and testicular histology varies from complete absence of germinal elements to maturation arrest of spermatogenesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91851 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346304830\"><span class=\"h3\">Undervirilized fertile male syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the clinical syndromes described above, it was assumed that infertility might be a consistent manifestation of AR disorders.

This X-linked disorder is characterized by progressive degeneration of anterior motor neurons and is associated with late-onset gynecomastia, defective spermatogenesis, and a hormonal profile consistent with androgen resistance. The AR gene in these men contains an expansion in the number of glutamine repeats in the N-terminal region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61536 \">figure 1</a>) from the usual 20 glutamines to more than twice that number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In 8 of 30 families, de novo mutations were identified, some present in mosaic form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Although loss of function mutations of the AR can be identified in most women with CAIS, mutations of the coding sequence of the AR are found in only approximately 20 percent of the individuals with the diagnosis of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) and a negative family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The diagnosis should be reconsidered in these patients, and novel genetic approaches with next-generation sequencing might reveal a different genetic origin of disorders of sex development (DSD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/16,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,58</a>]. In addition, mutations outside of the coding region of the AR gene should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype correlations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major deletions or premature termination codons have been found only in patients with CAIS. Amino acid substitutions can cause the entire spectrum of phenotypes from infertile men to CAIS. Approximately 80 percent of the amino acid substitutions are in the hormone-binding domain, and many of the remaining 20 percent are in the DNA-binding domain. DNA-binding domain mutations are usually associated with normal androgen binding but defective ability to activate androgen-responsive genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Understanding how one amino acid substitution leads to a greater impairment in receptor function than another will require knowledge of the crystal structure of the androgen-AR complex. Interestingly, mutations in exon 1 turn out to be more common than originally thought, indicating that this exon needs to be sequenced routinely in a diagnostic setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The mutations characterized in patients with the infertile male syndrome and the undervirilized fertile male syndrome cause amino acid substitutions mostly in the hormone-binding domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>], although in this patient group mutations have also been described in the N-terminal domain, whose functional properties remain largely unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In some patients with PAIS due to amino acid substitutions in the hormone-binding domain, the hormone resistance can be overcome in part by supraphysiological doses of androgen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the androgen receptor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is more difficult to understand why, in some families, affected individuals with the same mutation have different phenotypes and how the same mutation can produce different phenotypes in different families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In one study, phenotypic variation was seen in three of nine families with PAIS but in none of the families with CAIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Variable timing of receptor expression or differences in testosterone synthesis or metabolism could have an impact on the expression of a mutation in a given patient. Alternatively, variations in unidentified proteins, such as other members of the transcription regulatory complex, may alter the activity of the AR. Similarly, differences in the lengths of the polyglutamine and polyglycine repeat sequences in the N-terminal domain of the protein can influence the effect of given mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p>Patients with AIS, as well as all patients with DSD, should be registered in the <a href=\"http://www.i-dsd.org/&amp;token=/nbC+bE0g9alZ1bYvv5qWMom+VtLyIizPModgfXC/z8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7458\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">international DSD database</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H904842\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders of androgen action are one common form of 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss-of-function mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) lead to variable defects in virilization or infertility in 46,XY males with testes and normal testosterone formation.
