This results in the &ldquo;sicca complex,&rdquo; a combination of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca [KCS]) and dry mouth (xerostomia). Additional disease manifestations may also be present, including dryness of the skin and other mucosal surfaces. Systemic extraglandular features include arthritis, renal, hematopoietic, and pulmonary involvement, and vasculitis. Neurologic manifestations include peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, and cognitive disturbances. These extraglandular manifestations may result from vasculitis, autoantibody-mediated mechanisms, or lymphocytic infiltration of the target organs. There is a marked increased risk of lymphoma in comparison with other autoimmune disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-exocrine-gland-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Exocrine gland disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of SS includes multiple genetic and nongenetic interacting factors. There is involvement of innate and adaptive immunity, as well as neuroendocrine and neuropathic processes. Biopsies of glandular and extraglandular sites are characterized by lymphocytic infiltration, with immunohistologic evidence for involvement of numerous elements of innate and adaptive immune responses. Further, cellular adhesive molecules, metalloproteinases, and neural transmitters show alterations in the affected target organs. Thus, SS represents an interface of autoimmunity with lymphoma, and of autoimmunity with neuroendocrine disorders.</p><p>Many aspects of SS are shared with other systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including a female preponderance (9:1 female to male), distinctive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations, familial clustering with other autoimmune conditions, the presence of characteristic autoantibodies, and the existence of shared clinical features (eg, arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, serositis) with other autoimmune connective tissue diseases. There are strong similarities to the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but important differences between these disorders exist. Despite the areas of overlap between SS and SLE, differences include the autoantibody profiles (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">-La/SSB</span> are not criteria for SLE), the intraglandular lymphoid infiltrates, and the frequency of lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other well-defined autoimmune diseases and in a secondary form associated with other well-defined autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, progressive systemic sclerosis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Pathophysiologic distinctions between primary and secondary SS have been demonstrated in the genetic associations, serology, and histology of the salivary gland biopsies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of SS is reviewed here.

The findings suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies of twins have shown that although Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (SS) is more common in the monozygotic twins, the concordance rate is only about 20 percent, suggesting the importance of epigenetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genome-wide association screens and molecular analyses of salivary gland biopsies from SS patients suggest important roles for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules, homing receptors, and genes encoding elements of both innate and acquired immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The genome-wide associations in SS differ from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in that only SS shows association with homing receptors and a locus associated with increased lymphoma risk. (See <a href=\"#H10314717\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigenetic factors, such as gene recombination, noncoding RNA transcripts, and histone methylation, may all play a role through the modulation of gene expression. These factors have been the subject of only very limited study in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] but are involved in the pathogenesis of other related systemic rheumatic disorders and are likely to also participate in the pathogenesis of SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental triggers remain poorly understood, but there is particular interest in viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) based upon findings from genome sequencing and microRNA (miRNA) expression in the affected glands.

(See <a href=\"#H250762032\" class=\"local\">'HLA genes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H250762045\" class=\"local\">'Non-HLA genes'</a> below.)</p><p>A familial tendency to develop SS has been well-documented, along with an increased risk of a variety of autoimmune disorders in relatives of patients with SS. As an example, definite or probable SS (by California criteria) occurred in 4.4 percent of first-degree relatives of patients with SS in one series; all of the affected relatives were women who were older than the probands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Family members in another study were more likely to have autoantibodies but without development of clinical SS with follow-up for up to 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Multiple polymorphisms have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of patients with SS in cohorts of European [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and Han Chinese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] descent, many of which involved genes associated with innate or adaptive immune responses. The majority of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) identified were not located in protein coding regions but may involve distant promoters or non-translated RNA that might act as &ldquo;scaffolding&rdquo; to hold or direct other proteins in their activity. Limitations inherent in GWAS of a multigenic disease such as SS include the inadequacy of typical sample sizes, given the large number of genes involved in autoimmune diseases such as SS and the large number of alleles at each gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250762032\"><span class=\"h3\">HLA genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strongest associations are with MHC genes, including those in the HLA-DR region, but there is considerable heterogeneity across different ethnic groups.

As an example, one study found that all 106 subjects with SS or SLE who produced <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> antibodies had glutamine at position 34 of DQA1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leucine at position 26 of DQB1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A gene dose effect is suggested by evidence of an association of increasing risk of producing <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> antibodies with the presence of a greater number of such DQA and DQB alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250762045\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-HLA genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genes other than those of the HLA loci may also be associated with an increased risk of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; those with the strongest associations on GWAS include <em>IRF5</em> and <em>TNIP1</em>, which are both involved in innate immunity; and <em>BLK</em>, <em>STAT4</em>, <em>IL12A</em>, and <em>CXCR5</em>, which are involved in adaptive immunity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F94597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94597 \">table 1</a>). A variety of other genes have been identified in such studies, but their degrees of association do not reach genome-wide significance; these include some involved in innate immunity, such as <em>MBL2</em>, <em>FCGR2B</em>, <em>LTA </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], <em>TNF</em>, <em>NCR3</em>, and <em>NFKBIA</em>, and others that have a role in the adaptive immune response, including <em>TAP2</em>, <em>EBF1</em>, <em>PTPN22</em>, <em>TNFRSF4</em>, and <em>IL10</em>.</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-10 promoter polymorphisms are of interest, as there is strong sequence homology of IL-10, an antiinflammatory cytokine and a factor in B-cell proliferation, with the EBV-encoded protein BCRF1. <em>TNIP1</em> encodes an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling through interference with A20 (<em>TNFAIP3</em>), which is important in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signalling and lymphogenesis in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><em>PTPN22</em> is the gene for a tyrosine protein phosphatase that plays a role in T-and B-cell receptor signalling; polymorphisms in this locus are associated with decreased responses among smokers to biologic agents.</p><p>A possible role for maternal=fetal microchimerism in patients with primary SS was suggested by the finding of DNA sequences derived from the Y chromosome in biopsy material from labial salivary glands of 36 percent of female patients with SS, but in none of 10 patients with other disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, subsequent studies have not supported these initial observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10314723\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential role of viral infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A role for viruses in the pathogenesis of SS is suggested by a number of observations, but no single virus has been clearly implicated. Evidence of ongoing or past viral infection can be detected in many patients, but no virus has been found at high levels in target tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is possible that low levels of virus-infected cells may be sufficient to break tolerance to autoantigens. Observations supporting a viral etiology include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain viruses, particularly EBV, the ubiquitous herpes-type virus that causes infectious mononucleosis, frequently infect the salivary glands. EBV is spread to non-infected individuals via the saliva; primary EBV infections progress to lifelong latent infection with periodic reactivation; and the site of latency for EBV is in the salivary gland. EBV can induce strong immune responses by T cells and activate B-cell production of autoantibodies. (See <a href=\"#H10314735\" class=\"local\">'Epstein-Barr virus'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span> antigens, targets of autoantibody production in SS, were first identified as &ldquo;chaperones&rdquo; for viral RNA after infection with either adenovirus or EBV (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-anti-ro-ssa-and-anti-la-ssb-antigen-antibody-systems\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antigen-antibody systems&quot;</a>). It is intriguing to realize that autoantibodies in SS precede symptom onset with up to 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least three viruses (human T-lymphotropic virus [HTLV] type I, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and hepatitis C virus [HCV]) are associated with clinical syndromes that share many features of SS. (See <a href=\"#H250762577\" class=\"local\">'Viruses causing SS-like disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10314735\"><span class=\"h3\">Epstein-Barr virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV, with its site of infection in the salivary glands and latency in these sites, has received the greatest attention among viruses postulated as having a role in the etiopathogenesis of SS, but the findings are mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Initial interest also focused on cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6).</p><p>The high level of infection with EBV within the general population complicates studies, and serologic data regarding EBV, CMV, and HHV-6 have been conflicting. Some reports have found raised antibody titers to all three viruses in patients with SS, compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], while other studies have not found such differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Similarly, genetic material from EBV can be detected in SS salivary tissue by DNA hybridization, but similar findings can also be seen in normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, even when EBV is detected in salivary tissue, less than 1 percent of cells are infected, and there may be a delay of many years between primary infection and the development of SS.</p><p>There has been a renewed interest in the role of EBV with the detection of several viral-encoded miRNA, including miR-146a and BART155, in salivary gland biopsies of patients with SS, and there is evidence that some extracellular miRNAs may stimulate the innate immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other studies have also shown conserved stable intronic EBV sequences that may generate functional RNA and RNA structures, and a genome-wide survey identified at least four different EBV strains that may have latency or inserted introns that play a role in autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Another aspect of the relationship of EBV to SS is the finding that the EBV-encoded <em>BCRF1</em> gene product (viral IL-10) has strong sequence homology to IL-10 and encoded miRNA detected in SS salivary gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/5,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,34</a>]. Other viruses of interest in SS based upon on miRNA sequences include adenoviruses, other herpes viruses, and polyoma viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Attention has become focused on the detection of unusual virus genomes or atypical immune responses to virus by the host, because a causal link between these ubiquitous viruses and disease is difficult to prove. As an example, a study of Chinese patients with SS found that genetic material from EBV was detectable but differed from normal EBV in that the DNA contained an unusual genomic deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, it is possible that the EBV in patients with SS differs structurally or antigenically from that in controls or that some subjects have an HLA-restricted inability to clear EBV-infected cells, thereby predisposing these individuals to persistent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250762504\"><span class=\"h3\">Coxsackie virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coxsackie virus infection has been proposed as having a role in primary SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In one study, coxsackie virus RNA was identified in extracts of tissue from minor salivary gland biopsies in seven of eight patients with primary SS, but from none of those with secondary SS nor from control tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Immunohistochemical evidence of viral protein revealed reactivity in 11 of 12 samples from the patients with primary SS and one of eight with secondary SS, but not in controls. However, a report from another center failed to confirm these observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although the observation of coxsackie viral nucleic acids has not been replicated, subsequent studies have demonstrated antigenic cross reactivity between particular coxsackie peptides and <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> 60 kD peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Thus, molecular mimicry between cell encoded autoantigens and exogenous agents must be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H250762577\"><span class=\"h3\">Viruses causing SS-like disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several viruses can cause disorders that strongly resemble SS in many respects but which are distinct from primary or secondary SS. These include retroviruses, such as HIV and HTLV-1, and HCV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10314741\"><span class=\"h4\">Retroviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two retroviruses, HIV and HTLV-I, cause SS-like syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/37,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,43</a>]. However, there is no convincing evidence for retroviruses as a causal agent in SS itself as usually seen in Caucasian populations, and the role of retroviruses remains to be elucidated. Retroviruses can disrupt the immune system by infecting immune cells, potentially leading to suppression, destruction, or stimulation of T cells; increased production of antibodies; and development of malignancies such as lymphomas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HTLV-I</strong> &ndash; Two groups reported the presence of the Tax gene from the HTLV-I genome in salivary gland tissue from patients with SS, although other HTLV-1 genes were not detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. A hypothesis to explain these findings is that these results represented infection with a defective virus in which all genes other than Tax had been deleted. This theory would explain the lack of easy vertical transmission that would be expected in complete virus infection, and it is consistent with findings in other diseases in which defective HTLV-I proviruses are thought to play a role, such as mycosis fungoides and HTLV-I-associated T-cell leukemia. In both studies, no patient had serum antibodies to HTLV-I, in marked contrast with earlier reports suggesting an increase in antibodies to HTLV-I in patients with SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. It is unclear whether some subgroups of SS patients are able to produce antibodies to HTLV-I while others are not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional support for a role for HTLV-I came from a transgenic mouse model into which the Tax gene had been inserted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Tissue injury occurs through the activation of these immune pathways by lymphocytes within the glandular tissues or extraglandular sites, leading to the release of cytokines, including interferon (IFN) gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and others, and the production of characteristic autoantibodies. Apoptosis of glandular cells and dysfunction of residual glandular cells and tissues occurs due to cytokines and metalloproteinases that interfere with salivary gland organization and function.

These immune complexes were able to bind to TLR3 that have been detected in SS glands in epithelial, dendritic, and B cells.

Engagement of these TLRs results in the activation of multiple signaling pathways that culminates in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and type I IFN (IFN-alpha and -beta).

A proposed explanation for this observation emphasizes the importance of the functional circuit of the lacrimal gland, which may be considered to start at the corneal mucosal surface, and includes the lacrimal gland structures and the connecting innervation in the corneal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. These afferent nerves from the mucosal surfaces travel to the midbrain (particularly cranial nerve V regions of the lacrimatory and salvatory nuclei) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/144-146\" class=\"abstract_t\">144-146</a>]. A similar type of circuit may be involved in symptoms arising at the oral mucosal surface. The innervation in the eye includes myelinated A-delta fibers that run parallel to the corneal surface within the basal cell layer and unmyelinated C fibers that turn upward from the epithelial plexus toward the surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>]. A-delta fibers are large-diameter, straight nerves that respond primarily to mechanical stimuli, whereas C fibers are small-diameter, beaded nerves that respond to thermal and chemical stimuli. One study has also led to the surprising finding that a class of receptors associated with thermoregulation may be responsible for &ldquo;sensation of dryness&rdquo; sensed by the patient, presumably due to neural stimulation by evaporative loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].</p><p>The stimulus that induces the activation of these cells activates neural mechanisms responsible for perception of acute pain, with consequent behavioral adaptation aimed to give protection from the irritating stimulus. Persistent C fiber input can easily lead to the summation (wind-up) of stimuli, resulting in augmented responses of the spinal trigeminal nuclei neurons and final central sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/149,150\" class=\"abstract_t\">149,150</a>].</p><p>Inflammation will also activate the parasympathetic innervation of the lacrimal glands and conjunctival goblet cells, resulting in increased secretion. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions such as SS, summation of peripheral input may occur, since C fiber activity starts to dominate the A-delta fiber activity, resulting in inhibition of the parasympathetic system at the central level of the periaqueductal grey area of the limbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/151,152\" class=\"abstract_t\">151,152</a>]. This results in further peripheral sympathetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasympathetic dysfunction in SS.</p><p>The afferents of these corneal nerves travel to trigeminal ganglion neurons. In animal models, the inflammatory process affects microglial cells in these midbrain nuclei and subsequently influences production of neurokines and neural efferents to the brain cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. The microglial cells are specialized in the preferential detection of various modalities of physical (mechanical, thermal) and chemical (exogenous) irritants. These microglial cells influence the local neurons to encode the spatial and temporal characteristics (intensity and duration) of the inflammation in a discharge of nerve impulses that are ultimately transmitted to the cortex.</p><p>Most trigeminal ganglion neurons belong to the general group of nociceptive sensory neurons whose peripheral nerve endings are activated by injurious or near-injurious stimuli that initiate normal pain sensations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. The glial cells and neurons in trigeminal nerve V are affected by the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>], and type 1 interferon (IFN), that may serve to interfere with the neural innervation or hormonal receptors of the end-organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/155-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">155-157</a>].</p><p>However, a series of additional cytokines and neurotransmitters may play a role at the level of cranial nerve V, which receives afferents from the mucosal surface and sends efferent signals to cortical regions of the brain that &ldquo;register&rdquo; sensations of pain or dryness. These complex interactions of inflammatory cytokines and <span class=\"nowrap\">cholinergic/sympathetic</span> signals have been evaluated in animal models for SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/148,158-160\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,158-160</a>].</p><p>The projections from the trigeminal nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F94554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94554 \">figure 1</a>) go to specific regions of the somatosensory cortex that have been mapped by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allowing for studies indicating that SS patients with chronic ocular pain exhibit a characteristic fMRI stimulation pattern at a lower level of noxious stimulation than patients with early-onset SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].</p><p>Other neuropathic changes may include abnormalities in gastrointestinal and bladder motility, which have been attributed to autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>].

Molecular genetic analyses suggest important roles for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules, homing receptors, and genes encoding elements of both innate and acquired immunity. The strongest associations are with genes in the HLA-DR region, but there is considerable heterogeneity across different ethnic groups. Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (SS) genetically differs from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in that only SS shows an association with homing receptors and a locus associated with increased lymphoma risk. Epigenetic factors may play a role through modulation of gene expression.

Tissue injury occurs through the activation of these immune pathways by lymphocytes within the glandular tissues or extraglandular sites, leading to the release of cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, and B-cell activating factor. Salivary and lacrimal gland epithelial cells, as well as the local vascular adhesive molecules, play important roles in the early steps of lymphocyte homing and inflammation (see <a href=\"#H337541640\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of immune-mediated injury'</a> above). An explanation might be that the viral trigger took place years before development of SS. (See <a href=\"#H10314777\" class=\"local\">'Ro/SSA and La/SSB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SS is characterized by the presence of certain autoantibodies, which by some criteria are required for the diagnosis; these include <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span>.

The infiltrates consist of focal aggregates (50 or more cells) of lymphocytes, beginning around the ducts and spreading to involve the entire lobule. Migration of the lymphocytes occurs to the gland in response to chemokines, adhesion to specific vascular adhesion molecules, and entry into the glandular cells where they interact with dendritic cells and epithelial cells.
