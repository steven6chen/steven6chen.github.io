LGLs comprise 10 to 15 percent of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The absolute number of LGLs in the peripheral blood of normal subjects is 200 to <span class=\"nowrap\">400/microL</span>.</p><p>LGLs arise from two major lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. About 85 percent of normal LGLs have an NK cell phenotype, and only 15 percent are derived from T cells. The phenotypes of LGLs in LGL leukemia, however, are just the opposite:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD3 positive T cell lineage &ndash; Approximately 85 percent of circulating LGLs are CD3 positive, CD57 positive, CD56 negative T cells, representing in vivo antigen-activated effector-memory cytotoxic T cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD3 negative NK cell lineage &ndash; The remaining 15 percent of circulating LGLs are CD3-, CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells. It had been postulated that such NK cells mediate non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity. It is now established that NK cells possess specific receptors for MHC class I molecules named &quot;killer-cell Ig-like inhibitory receptor&quot; (KIR) and &quot;killer-cell activating receptor&quot; (KAR). Interactions between these receptors and MHC class I molecules on target cells may inhibit or activate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><p/><p>LGL leukemia can arise from the clonal proliferation of LGLs of T cell or NK cell lineage. The management of LGL leukemia will be discussed here. The etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of T cell LGL leukemia and the diagnosis and management of NK cell LGL leukemia are discussed separately.

Active treatment is typically reserved for patients with symptomatic disease. This is principally because most cases have an indolent clinical behavior with a median survival over 10 years, and because LGL leukemia cannot be cured by current treatment options. Spontaneous remission of LGL leukemia has been documented very rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The main goal of treatment for patients with LGL leukemia is the relief of symptoms, and especially a reduction in infections associated with neutropenia. Although intuitively sensible, it remains unclear whether achievement of hematologic improvement prolongs survival.</p><p>Among newly diagnosed patients with asymptomatic LGL leukemia, we suggest observation rather than immediate treatment. Treatment is indicated for relief of symptoms or life-threatening peripheral blood cytopenias:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1000/microL)</span> with recurrent infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic or transfusion dependent anemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL),</span> which is a very rare event</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated autoimmune conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) requiring therapy</p><p/><p>Some patients with severe neutropenia as their only symptom may be reluctant to start treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Most experts in the field would suggest initiating immunosuppressive therapy in such patients. A less attractive alternative is the intermittent use of antibiotics and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) during febrile episodes. G-CSF can result in a transient partial correction of the neutropenia in such settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1147328348\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, immediate treatment is indicated for patients with symptomatic disease. Otherwise, a period of observation is suggested. During the observation period, we perform a complete blood count with differential every 6 to 12 months, along with a clinical examination. Patients are encouraged to contact their health care providers sooner if they have symptoms worrisome of disease progression (eg, recurrent infections, fatigue, dyspnea, bleeding).</p><p>Approximately 70 percent of patients ultimately require therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], most commonly because of recurrent infection secondary to severe neutropenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1147328356\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the initiation of active therapy for patients with symptomatic disease, patients with LGL leukemia should undergo a pretreatment evaluation to determine the extent of disease, patient performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785%7EHEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 graphicRef72901 \">table 1A-B</a>), and assessment of comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options.</p><p>In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with LGL leukemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is recommended if the diagnosis is uncertain.

Although experts in the field prefer different specific regimens, there is general agreement that immunosuppressive therapy (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) is the cornerstone of initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The various immunosuppressive treatments have not been directly compared with one another in a prospective fashion, and data come primarily from small, retrospective case series. These series have used different response criteria and provide little information regarding time to response, response and treatment duration, and time to treatment failure. </p><p>The most promising results have been reported following the use of low-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, either as single agents or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/2,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-11</a>]. Prednisone may quicken the initial response when administered as adjunctive therapy with another first-line immunosuppressive agent. However, single agent therapy with prednisone is not recommended because it has a low response rate and does not reduce LGL clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A choice among immunosuppressive treatments is primarily made based upon the clinical setting and physician experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutropenia</strong> &ndash; We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for patients with neutropenia as their primary symptom. For patients with an absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> oral prednisone (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) is administered in addition to the methotrexate for the first month and tapered off by the end of the second month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune disorders</strong> &ndash; We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly) with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for patients with an associated autoimmune disorder (eg, rheumatoid arthritis).

As an example, prednisone may help control joint pain related to rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia</strong> &ndash; We prefer either oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly) or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (100 mg daily) for patients with anemia. While both of these agents have demonstrated activity in this setting, some clinicians prefer cyclophosphamide for patients with anemia at least partially due to its demonstrated activity in patients with pure red cell aplasia, and its activity in patients with LGL leukemia who progress despite treatment with methotrexate. Other clinicians prefer methotrexate because it can be continued indefinitely as long as it is tolerated, whereas treatment with oral cyclophosphamide is limited to no more than 6 to 12 months.</p><p/><p>Response rates with the regimens are described in the following sections. The initial immunosuppressive regimen is continued until disease progression or until the maximum length of treatment is reached.

When compiling all the results reported in the literature, responses are seen in approximately half of patients, with a time to response ranging from 2 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The median duration of response ranges from two to four years.</p><p>The following are the largest studies investigating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in this population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial prospective study evaluated the efficacy of oral low-dose pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in 10 patients with T-LGL leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-large-granular-lymphocyte-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Methotrexate was started at a dose of 5.0 to 7.5 mg PO, given once per week in split AM and PM doses, and gradually increased to 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per week) over one to three months. In patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> prior to starting methotrexate (in doses of 20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> PO), the addition of methotrexate allowed reduction of the daily dose of prednisone to as low as 0 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> without losing its effectiveness on reversal of neutropenia.

Plasma creatinine is adequate for follow-up of the renal function; an increase above baseline by more than 30 percent (even if it is still in the normal range) requires a decrease of the dose or a temporary discontinuation of the drug. Similarly, hypertension during therapy should prompt reduction in dosage or initiation of anti-hypertensive therapy.

LGL leukemia can arise from the clonal proliferation of LGLs of T cell or NK cell lineage. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all patients with LGL leukemia require treatment at the time of diagnosis. Among newly diagnosed patients with asymptomatic T-LGL, we suggest close observation rather than immediate treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment is reserved for patients with symptoms due to neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, and for patients with associated autoimmune conditions requiring therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1147328340\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1147328348\" class=\"local\">'Management of asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no agreed upon standard treatment regimen for symptomatic LGL leukemia, but there is general agreement that immunosuppressive therapy (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) is the cornerstone of initial treatment.

For patients with an absolute neutrophil count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> oral prednisone (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) is administered in addition to the methotrexate for the first month and tapered off by the end of the second month.
