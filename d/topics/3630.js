In general, criteria for the classification of the idiopathic arthritides of childhood are intended to subdivide childhood-onset arthritides in a manner that allows better understanding of their pathogenesis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Many nomenclature systems include further &quot;descriptors&quot; within each category that are expected to result in additional subclassifications over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The purpose of these strict and sometimes confusing subtypes is to stratify patients entered into studies into homogeneous groups. Unfortunately, the intended restriction of these criteria for use only in enrolling in standardized trials never materialized. Use as diagnostic categories has resulted in additional misunderstanding.</p><p>Several changes in the terminology of juvenile arthritis have been proposed. The older terms juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA, used commonly in the United States) and juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA, preferred in Europe) were replaced by the term juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) at meetings of the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) in the late 1990s. JIA incorporates all of what was called JRA in the past and also includes all other forms of &quot;idiopathic&quot; arthritis in childhood. This change, while well intentioned, has led to confusion since many clinicians assume that JIA is the same as JRA and that the new name was put in place solely in order to distinguish arthritis in children from rheumatoid arthritis in adults. It is important for clinicians to remember that all of the children within the various systems may be diagnosed accurately as having juvenile arthritis. Beyond that, all nomenclature, including the JIA classification, has shortcomings. Systems will remain imperfect until enough is known to allow classification based upon pathophysiology and genetics rather than superficial phenotypes. Nonetheless, it is necessary for clinicians to communicate with a common frame of reference. Thus, clinicians who diagnose and treat children with arthritis should at least be familiar with the JIA nomenclature, which is broadly used in textbooks and journal articles. It has become increasingly clear that many of these forms of arthritis have a distinct etiology, pathogenesis, and natural history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Until a better classification system is devised, it is important for clinicians to recognize that this nomenclature was not intended for broad clinical use and that consensus treatment recommendations applied to all children with JIA cannot be relied upon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28169068\"><span class=\"h1\">JRA SUBSETS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The previously used juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) classification divided childhood arthritis into three subsets based upon associated symptoms and the number of joints involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56224 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic JRA (formerly called Still's disease) referred to patients with rash and intermittent fever, in addition to arthritis of any number of joints. It is responsible for approximately 10 to 15 percent of JRA cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoarticular JRA includes those patients with involvement of fewer than five joints after six months of illness. It accounts for approximately 50 percent of cases of JRA. However, it is now recognized that this disease consists of several distinct subgroups with varying prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyarticular JRA is defined by the involvement of more than four joints after six months of illness. It is responsible for 30 to 40 percent of cases of JRA. As with oligoarticular JRA, it is now recognized to contain many distinct subgroups with varying prognosis.</p><p/><p>Although this classification serves to categorize patients into subsets with differing disease course and prognosis, it has long been recognized that subgroups exist within these distinctions and that many children cannot be adequately categorized within this limited taxonomy. To further divide according to genetic predispositions, initiating agents, and response to therapy, it is necessary to recognize the distinct subgroups of childhood arthritis. Further, because JRA is indeed distinct from adult-onset arthritis, it was decided to remove the term &quot;rheumatoid&quot; to emphasize that childhood arthritis most often has no relationship to seropositive rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SUGGESTED CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria for classification of the idiopathic arthritides of childhood are intended to define the separate childhood-onset arthritides in a manner that allows better evaluation of etiologic mechanisms and newer therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Division into these nonoverlapping categories, however, led to an increase in the number of &quot;unclassifiable&quot; cases meeting inclusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exclusion criteria for more than one category. In addition, some children change categories over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is not a manifestation of the child changing from one disease to another but simply failure of the classification system initially to categorize the child's disease properly. While this system is now used the most widely in the rheumatologic literature, it must be remembered that each category most likely represents more than a single distinct disease. Subsequent reports have reinforced the idea that many of the children classified as having juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in fact have early manifestations of what are recognized to be distinct diseases in adults (eg, systemic JIA and adult Still&rsquo;s disease, polyarthritis [rheumatoid <span class=\"nowrap\">factor-positive/rheumatoid</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">factor-negative]/extended</span> oligoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">oligoarthritis/enthesitis-related</span> arthritis and spondyloarthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The &quot;ILAR criteria&quot; categories include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyarthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoarthritis (persistent and extended)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis-related arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoriatic arthritis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic arthritis (systemic JIA) defines the subset of patients that were previously labeled with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) or Still's disease.

Children with clearly identifiable syndromes associated with fever and arthritis, such as polyarteritis nodosa, are considered separately.

These children clearly have arthritis, but they cannot be adequately categorized using the other JIA categories. It includes some children previously diagnosed with spondyloarthropathies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spondyloarthritis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spondyloarthritis in children&quot;</a>), as well as some children likely to develop psoriatic arthritis who lack sufficient criteria at the time of diagnosis. In fact, classification of spondyloarthropathies in the adult literature is advancing rapidly with the clear recognition that these diseases are unrelated to other forms of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the absence of another widely used nomenclature system for children, clinicians may explain to families that their child has a spondyloarthropathy, while mentioning that the condition falls into a broader category of &quot;enthesitis-related arthritis&quot; according to the ILAR criteria.</p><p>At present, children with a variety of findings such as ANA, rheumatoid factor, or underlying inflammatory bowel disease are specifically excluded from clinical studies and do not &quot;fit&quot; into the classification system. Often they are referred to as &quot;unclassifiable.&quot; However, they are unclassifiable only for purposes of entry into clinical studies. These children clearly have juvenile arthritis and require appropriate treatment despite the fact that they are not candidates for entry into drug trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Psoriatic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psoriatic arthritis includes two groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with arthritis and psoriasis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with arthritis and a positive family history of psoriasis in a first-degree relative, plus dactylitis or appropriate fingernail abnormalities (eg, pitting or onycholysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p>Descriptors include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pattern of arthritis (eg, symmetry)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease course (pauciarthritis or polyarthritis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of ANA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uveitis</p><p/><p>In the past, seronegativity for rheumatoid factor has been a requirement for the diagnosis. However, more than 10 percent of patients with uncomplicated psoriasis and up to 15 percent of the normal population have rheumatoid factor present in their serum. As a result, the term &quot;usually seronegative&quot; arthritis is most suitable for psoriatic arthritis.

Eighty percent of the children could be categorized.

There are children who do not fit into any category or who overlap more than one category. The nomenclature should therefore be regarded as a &quot;work in progress.&quot; Over time, this nomenclature will be further refined to allow better characterization of patients. The inability to properly distinguish different causes of arthritis significantly impairs our ability to determine optimal therapy. With improving genetic and pathophysiologic understanding of arthritis, trials will contain increasingly homogeneous collections of children with biologically distinct illnesses. In the interim, it is important for clinicians to recognize that this nomenclature was not intended for broad clinical use and that consensus treatment recommendations applied to all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) cannot be relied upon.</p><p>When dealing with children who fail to fit neatly into any of the categories delineated above, we must be careful not to confuse either parents or caregivers. The inability to satisfactorily place the patient into one of these categories does not exclude the presence of arthritis or the ability to make a diagnosis. Rather, these children should be told that they have juvenile arthritis. It is not important that their illness does not fit neatly into any of the subtypes defined thus far. As noted above, it is important to have well-defined groups of patients for investigational trials but to not produce unnecessary confusion for patients, parents, and clinicians.</p><p>Overall, it is important that every clinician recognize that childhood arthritis is not a homogeneous entity. Thus, there is no single best:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic appearance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criterion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uniform prognosis</p><p/><p>Many of the publications describing the natural history of juvenile arthritis and the efficacy of therapeutic modalities are based on trials which included all children with juvenile arthritis. These manuscripts are of questionable scientific value, since it is clear that such a large and diverse group of children includes diseases with myriad causes, prognoses, and responses to therapy. Unfortunately, even manuscripts which carefully categorized children into groups based on previous juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) or juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) criteria may not be directly applicable to children diagnosed according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) system. Hopefully, as the pathophysiologic bases of subsets of juvenile arthritis are better understood, more precise classification of children with arthritis will be possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2825842239\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Thomas JA Lehman, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-juvenile-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fink CW.
