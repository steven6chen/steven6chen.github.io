This syndrome is associated with an increased risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a characteristic life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia also known as torsades de pointes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2A-B</a>). The primary symptoms in patients with LQTS include palpitations, syncope, seizures, and sudden cardiac death.</p><p>LQTS may be either congenital or acquired. These two primary syndromes (congenital and acquired LQTS) may be related, as some patients who develop acquired LQTS may have an inherited predisposition with abnormalities in repolarization that represent the forme fruste of LQTS. Acquired LQTS usually results from drug therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>), although hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia can increase the risk of drug-induced LQTS. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Mutations in LQTS genes'</a> below.)</p><p>The definition, causes, and pathophysiology of acquired LQTS will be reviewed here.

Overall, the average QTc in healthy persons during infancy is 400&plusmn;20 milliseconds and increases slightly after puberty to 420&plusmn;20 milliseconds. In general, the 99th percentile QTc values are 460 milliseconds (prepuberty), 470 milliseconds in postpubertal males, and 480 milliseconds in postpubertal females. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H1298033160\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'ECG findings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Torsades de pointes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined as a ventricular rhythm faster than 100 beats per minute with frequent variations of the QRS axis, morphology, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a form of polymorphic VT that occurs in the setting of acquired or congenital QT interval prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In the specific case of TdP, these variations take the form of a progressive, sinusoidal, and cyclic alteration of the QRS axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2A-B</a>). The peaks of the QRS complexes appear to &quot;twist&quot; around the isoelectric line of the recording; hence the name torsades de pointes or &quot;twisting of the points.&quot;</p><p>Typical features of TdP include an antecedent prolonged QT interval, particularly in the last heart beat preceding the onset of the arrhythmia, a ventricular rate of 160 to 250 beats per minute, irregular RR intervals, and a cycling of the QRS axis through 180 degrees every 5 to 20 beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. TdP is usually short-lived and terminates spontaneously. However, most patients experience multiple episodes of the arrhythmia, and episodes can recur in rapid succession, potentially degenerating to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2468464986\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the absolute and comparative risk of the many drugs associated with QT prolongation is difficult, since most available data come from case reports or small observational series. Additionally, the incidence of QT prolongation without torsades de pointes (TdP) is likely much higher than the incidence of TdP itself. In one retrospective review of all hospital admissions to a single center over a six-month period, 293 out of 41,649 patients (0.7 percent) were noted to have a QTc &ge;500 milliseconds, but less than 6 percent of those with severe QT prolongation experienced syncope or a life-threatening arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In an observational study of 500,000 persons in the Netherlands, from which 775 cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD) were identified over a period of slightly less than nine years (with each case matched to up to 10 controls), 24 of 775 patients with SCD (3.1 percent) were currently using a QT-prolonging drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Current use of any noncardiac QT-prolonging drug was associated with a significantly increased risk of SCD (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.7), and the highest risk was associated with antipsychotic drugs (adjusted OR 5.0).</p><p>Although these results suggest that drug-induced TdP may be more common than documented cases suggest, the absolute number of events is still low and represents a small proportion of SCD events (24 of 775 patients with SCD [3.1 percent] were currently using a QT-prolonging drug).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proposed mechanism for drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) is the development of early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity resulting from prolonged repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The pathophysiology of LQTS is described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of the long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are thought to be pathophysiologic differences between the acquired and congenital forms of LQTS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the acquired form of LQTS is most commonly precipitated by short-long RR intervals. This interval typically is caused by a ventricular premature beat followed by a compensatory pause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2B</a>). Polymorphic VT also can occur in association with bradycardia or frequent pauses; as a result, the acquired form of LQTS is sometimes called &quot;pause-dependent&quot; LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The association between bradycardia and antiarrhythmic drug-induced TdP is thought to be related to a property of some of these drugs called &quot;reverse use dependence,&quot; which is defined as the inverse correlation between the heart rate and QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a result, the QT interval decreases as the heart rate increases and lengthens as the heart rate slows. This explains why drug-induced TdP is more commonly seen with bradycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Reverse use dependence may be mediated at least in part by changes in the extracellular potassium concentration. Virtually <strong>all of the drugs</strong> that produce LQTS act by blocking the outward IKr current, which is mediated by the potassium channel encoded by the <em>KCNH2</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/9-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-28</a>]. Lower heart rates result in less potassium moving out of the cell during repolarization (before subsequent reuptake by the Na-K-ATPase pump), since there are fewer repolarizations. The associated reduction in extracellular potassium concentration enhances the degree of drug-induced inhibition of IKr, increasing the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the association with bradycardia and pauses seen in acquired LQTS, arrhythmias in some forms of congenital LQTS tend to follow a sudden adrenergic surge (due, for example, to exercise or arousal), particularly congenital LQTS type 1 and, to a lesser degree, type 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64239 \">figure 1</a>).

This was illustrated in an observational study of 15 patients with congenital LQTS in which &quot;pause-dependent&quot; TdP, which is more characteristic of the acquired form, was noted in 14 of 15 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
