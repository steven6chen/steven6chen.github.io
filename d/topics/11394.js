Lyme disease is now the most common vector-borne illness in North America and Europe. Arthritis is the most common manifestation of late Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Because antibiotic treatment of early infection is usually curative, arthritic complications have become less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy of the musculoskeletal manifestations of Lyme disease will be reviewed here. General issues related to the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease are discussed separately.

However, the clinical features of each stage can overlap and some patients present in a later stage of Lyme disease without a history of prior signs or symptoms suggestive of earlier disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical stages'</a>.)</p><p>Lyme arthritis is a late finding of Lyme disease, whereas migratory or transient arthralgias can occur during the early localized or early disseminated stages, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SEASONALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early Lyme disease occurs primarily during the late spring and early summer when nymphal <em>Ixodes</em> ticks are active (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70029 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82209\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82209 \">figure 2</a>). In contrast, Lyme arthritis may begin in any season, weeks to months after initial infection. Affected individuals are typically active outdoors in locations endemic for Lyme disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80168\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80168 \">figure 3</a>).

EM may be the only disease manifestation of early localized infection, but migratory arthralgias and myalgias may also be evident.</p><p>Within several days to weeks, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> may disseminate to multiple sites (early disseminated disease), including the skin, heart, nervous system, or joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is almost always curative for both early localized and early disseminated stages of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Lyme arthritis occurs as a late manifestation of Lyme disease. These patients may have a history of antecedent erythema migrans (EM), but such a history occurs less frequently now than in the past because recognition of EM leads to curative treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Erythema migrans'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Erythema migrans'</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, signs and symptoms of early disease, including EM, may not occur or be recognized, however. In the United States, up to 60 percent of individuals with untreated early Lyme disease will subsequently develop Lyme arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthralgias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During early disseminated infection, patients may experience migratory pain in joints, bursae, tendons, muscle or bone, in one or a few locations at a time. Some patients develop only migratory arthralgias without arthritis. Arthralgia symptoms may be intermittent or migratory. Once diagnosed, arthralgias respond promptly to antibiotic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lyme arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of the articular manifestations of Lyme disease was described in the late 1970s, before the cause of Lyme disease and the role of antibiotics in its treatment were known. A cohort of 55 patients was followed prospectively from the onset of disease with erythema migrans (EM) through later manifestations of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The following findings were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme arthritis is characterized by intermittent or persistent arthritis. Monoarthritis of the knee is most common, but Lyme arthritis may also cause an asymmetric oligoarthritis, usually including the knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly involved joints, after the knee, are the shoulder, ankle, elbow, temporomandibular joint, and wrist, although any joint can be affected and occasionally, there is periarticular involvement, leading to bursitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tendinitis. Almost always, fewer than five joints are affected. Large joints are most commonly involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attacks of joint swelling tend to begin abruptly and last from several weeks to months. In 10 percent of untreated patients with Lyme arthritis, joint swelling lasts for more than a year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large joint effusions are common in the knees and elsewhere and often recur after aspiration. Popliteal cysts occur and can rupture if not aspirated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme arthritis is not particularly painful, except when there is pressure from a tensely swollen joint. Affected joints are usually very swollen and warm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, there is little joint dysfunction after resolution of arthritis. However, chronic, unremitting arthritis sometimes causes erosion of cartilage and bone and permanent joint damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with Lyme arthritis have accompanying fatigue. In this study, 10 of 28 patients with intermittent arthritis and 4 of 6 patients with chronic arthritis had fatigue. However, systemic symptoms are usually minor, if present at all, in patients with Lyme arthritis.</p><p/><p>In this study, 60 percent of individuals with untreated early Lyme disease developed Lyme arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although less common as a result of early detection and treatment of Lyme disease, Lyme arthritis is still the second most frequent manifestation of Lyme disease. Among more than 150,000 reports of Lyme disease made to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1992 and 2006, 32 percent had arthritis characterized by brief attacks of joint swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60753\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60753 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lyme arthritis is an infectious arthritis with an inflammatory synovial response. However, it may be confused with a mechanical injury when it presents as an acute monoarticular knee effusion in an active individual.</p><p>Unlike other forms of infectious arthritis, Lyme arthritis is only occasionally associated with fever or constitutional symptoms, and is less painful. Lyme arthritis may resemble spondyloarthropathy or oligoarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis when it is oligoarticular. It is not usually mistaken for adult onset rheumatoid arthritis, however, since it is not polyarticular or symmetrical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fibromyalgia symptoms are sometimes incorrectly attributed to Lyme arthritis. Lyme disease can cause migratory arthralgias; however, such symptoms are usually not chronic or associated with tender points, in contrast to fibromyalgia. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Distinction from fibromyalgia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lyme disease serologies are used to establish the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis in patients with potential exposure to <em>Ixodes</em> ticks and signs and symptoms of Lyme arthritis. Synovial fluid testing can establish the presence of an inflammatory arthritis, characterized by mean synovial white blood cells counts of 10,000 to 25,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serological responsiveness to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is the primary laboratory test for diagnosing Lyme arthritis. The immune response can take several weeks to develop, so some patients with early Lyme disease will be seronegative for <em>B. burgdorferi</em>-specific antibodies at the onset of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, all patients with Lyme arthritis will have positive serologies for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> since Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Criteria have been developed for establishing the diagnosis of Lyme disease using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening, followed by Western blot testing for <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. According to validated standards determined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and <span class=\"nowrap\">Prevention/Association</span> of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors, the criteria for Western blot immunoglobulin (IgG reactivity) require the presence of at least five of ten specific bands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50882 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These criteria were developed to maximize sensitivity and specificity during all stages of Lyme disease. Patients with Lyme arthritis usually far exceed the Western blot IgG reactivity criteria and often have IgM reactivity as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of Lyme disease is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most Lyme arthritis patients remain seropositive for years after successful antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Such seroreactivity, in the absence of other evidence for ongoing infection, is NOT an indication for retreatment. In fact, the robust immune response observed in patients with Lyme arthritis seems to confer protective immunity to reinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Analysis of synovial fluid by ELISA or Western blot will also demonstrate <em>B. burgdorferi</em> reactivity, but such testing is unnecessary, since it is neither more sensitive nor more specific than serum analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture and PCR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are only isolated reports of successful cultivation of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> from synovial fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, in clinical practice, it has been difficult to culture <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, except from erythema migrans (EM) skin biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> DNA is detectable in synovial fluid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in most untreated Lyme arthritis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Synovial fluid PCR testing usually becomes negative after treatment, but in one patient with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, it remained positive for 11 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>PCR was used to detect <em>B. burgdorferi</em> DNA in skin samples from 90 patients with EM, in synovial fluid from 63 patients with Lyme arthritis, and in synovial tissue from 9 patients with Lyme arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The skin lesions from most patients with EM were positive, as were the synovial fluid samples from patients with Lyme arthritis. Although it took longer for the PCR results from patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis (defined as arthritis lasting more than three months in spite of antibiotic therapy) to become negative than those from patients with antibiotic-responsive arthritis (arthritis lasting less than three months), positive PCR results from patients who had been treated for Lyme arthritis did not correlate with relapse or with subsequent duration of arthritis. In addition, PCR tests performed on synovectomy tissue were negative. <em>B. burgdorferi</em> messenger RNA, a marker of spirochetal viability, was detected in 8 of 10 skin samples from patients with EM, but in none of 11 synovial fluid samples, even when obtained prior to initiating antibiotics. This study suggests that the skin lesions of patients with EM contained viable <em>B. burgdorferi </em>organisms, whereas those detected in the synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis were moribund or dead. </p><p>PCR testing of synovial fluid has not been validated for widespread clinical use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF LYME ARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the natural history of Lyme arthritis demonstrate eventual resolution, even in the absence of antibiotic therapy, in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in untreated patients, Lyme arthritis can last for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. We recommend antibiotic treatment to accelerate resolution of arthritis and to prevent arthritis recurrence and other damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Not all patients respond to antibiotic therapy immediately. Clinical response may require several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trials of antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of Lyme arthritis is based upon small randomized controlled trials. The efficacy of antimicrobial therapy was demonstrated in a randomized trial in which 40 patients were assigned to 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin weekly for three weeks or to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Seven of the penicillin-treated patients (35 percent) had complete resolution of arthritis soon after the injections and remained well at a mean follow-up of 33 months. In contrast, all 20 placebo-treated patients continued to have attacks of arthritis during the trial.</p><p>A later randomized trial addressed the comparative efficacy of 30 days of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> in 38 patients with Lyme arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-lyme-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The arthritis resolved in 90 percent of patients within one to three months after study entry. However, neurologic manifestations were later recognized in five patients, four of whom had received the amoxicillin regimen.</p><p>The latter findings emphasize the importance of looking for neurologic disease in patients with Lyme arthritis, since these two late complications can occur simultaneously. Late neurologic manifestations require intravenous therapy.

In patients whose arthritis has improved but not completely resolved after one month of oral therapy, a second 28 day course of the same antibiotic is suggested.

It may begin in any season, weeks to months after initial infection. Many, but not all, patients will describe an antecedent history of erythema migrans or other early disease manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical stages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme arthritis is characterized by intermittent or persistent arthritis in a few large joints, especially the knee. The most commonly involved joints, after the knee, are the shoulder, ankle, elbow, temporomandibular joint, and wrist. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lyme arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migratory arthralgias may occur during early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease, and should be distinguished from frank arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Arthralgias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serological responsiveness to <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> is the primary laboratory test for Lyme arthritis. All patients with Lyme arthritis will have positive IgG serologies for <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Serologies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that the initial treatment of Lyme arthritis in patients without evidence of neurologic disease be oral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The typical course is 28 days. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose arthritis has improved but not completely resolved after one month of oral therapy, we suggest a second 28 day course of the same antibiotic (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, in patients who have had little or no improvement after the initial 28 day course, we suggest treatment with intravenous therapy (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> for 14 to 28 days) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
