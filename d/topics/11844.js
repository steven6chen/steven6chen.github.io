This condition is also referred to as trench foot or nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI). NFCI can cause gangrene or infection acutely, and cold intolerance and pain syndromes chronically.</p><p>Although less common, prolonged immersion in warm water can also cause injuries to feet and other tissues. These injuries can be painful and acutely debilitating but typically resolve with basic care and do not have lasting sequelae.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the presentation, diagnosis, and management of immersion foot syndromes, specifically NFCI and warm water-related injuries.

NFCI involves injury to the soft tissues, nerves, and vasculature of distal extremities from prolonged exposure to wet, cold (but nonfreezing; generally 0 to 15&deg;C or 32 to 59&deg;F) conditions. Most often feet are involved, but the condition can affect any dependent body part, including hands. In this topic, we will refer to all such conditions as nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI). Frostbite is distinguished from such injuries because it involves exposure to freezing temperatures, as implied by the name. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frostbite\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frostbite&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Feet and hands that sustain NFCI are initially white and numb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027 \">picture 1</a>), but later become red, edematous, and extremely painful. In severe cases, the extremity can develop hemorrhagic bullae and tissue necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H2805877661\" class=\"local\">'Nonfreezing cold injury'</a> below.)</p><p>The term trench foot was first used during World War I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although the condition had been recognized over 100 years earlier during Napoleon's disastrous winter campaign in Russia in 1812 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Immersion foot, an identical injury, was first described during World War II in shipwrecked sailors aboard life boats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When sailors are forced to kneel or sit on the floorboards of a wet boat or the bottom of a lifeboat, the knees or buttocks can be affected. The main civilian groups afflicted with NFCI are shipwrecked crews in cold waters and survivors of wilderness accidents such as plane crashes and capsized boats who have to walk in a cold, wet environment with wet shoes and clothing. Hikers and homeless people are also at risk for NFCI.</p><p>A number of other conditions either related or identical to NFCI have been described. One likely identical condition is &quot;seaboot foot&quot; or &quot;bridge foot&quot;<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The injury has been described in the hand of a diver who was exposed to cold (6&deg;C) water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>One related but distinct condition is shelter foot (or shelter limb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This condition was described during World War II in people who spent nights sitting in cold air-raid shelters without moving or elevating their legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

During the Falklands conflict of 1982, infantry units in one United Kingdom brigade reported an incidence of 76 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H640700828\"><span class=\"h2\">Civilian</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hikers and others who are exposed to cold, wet conditions for days without removing wet boots and socks are at risk for NFCI.

Skin blood flow is under both central and local control. In cold conditions, vasoconstriction can decrease skin blood flow to approximately 10 percent of baseline values. Because the metabolic demands of skin are low, decreased blood flow alone does not cause ischemia. Skin blood flow can also be decreased during periods of immobility when limbs are below the level of the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36087473\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold-induced vasodilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maximal vasoconstriction occurs when a hand or foot is cooled to approximately 15&deg;C (59&deg;F). Further cooling causes increases in blood flow known as cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) or the &quot;hunting response.&quot; CIVD occurs in 5- to 10-minute cycles. Prolonged and repeated cold exposures increase the amplitude and frequency of CIVD. Eskimos, Lapps, and Nordic fisherman have large CIVD response with rapid cycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A strong CIVD response is thought to decrease susceptibility to NFCI, but scientific evidence is lacking. A study of 206 Dutch Marines has been characterized as showing that a weak CIVD response correlates with increased susceptibility to NFCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, in the 11 subjects who later sustained cold injury, the injury was frostbite rather than NFCI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022976057\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF NONFREEZING COLD INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) is characterized by impaired control of circulation and direct damage to the microcirculation, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In animal studies, vascular damage includes microvascular thrombosis with endothelial damage. Reperfusion injury likely plays a role. Animal studies suggest that there can be reversible or permanent damage to nerves from cold, as well as damage to the microvascular blood supply of the nerves. The mechanism of direct neural damage is supported by clinical case reports of reversible peripheral nerve damage in people with severe hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Although many authors attribute NFCI solely to prolonged vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], the cause is likely more complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Animal experiments suggest that tissue damage is inversely proportional to tissue temperature and directly proportional to duration of exposure but that repeated exposure is likely to cause more damage than a single, longer exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The duration of a single exposure at a given temperature that is necessary to cause NFCI is not known, nor are there quantitative estimates of the effects of repeated exposure. Cold alone, without moisture, does not seem to be sufficient to cause NFCI. Immobility and malnutrition appear to contribute to injury in many cases.</p><p>Tissue loss is generally not a feature of NFCI. Tissue loss in severe cases of NFCI is likely due to pressure injury with or without compartment syndrome due to boots that become tight after the feet swell, rather than cold. Mechanical damage to the tissue also seems to contribute to tissue loss, such as in circumstances in which victims of NFCI must walk for long distances with wet, swollen feet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3472231421\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF WARM WATER IMMERSION INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research into the pathophysiology of warm water immersion injuries is limited. Warm water immersion foot (WWIF) is thought to be due to hyperhydration (waterlogging) of the plantar stratum corneum when continuously exposed to warm water for up to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tropical immersion foot (TIF) appears to be due to the passage of water through compromised epidermis into the dermis when the feet are continuously exposed to warm water for longer than 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3319051153\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR NONFREEZING COLD INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk of nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) exists with exposure to wet cold at temperatures from 0&deg;C (and also slightly below freezing) to approximately 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. During World War II, prolonged exposure of shipwrecked sailors to sea water at estimated temperatures of 16 to 21&deg;C (61 to 70&deg;F) for eight days resulted in injuries similar, if not identical, to immersion foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>There is great variability among individuals in susceptibility to cold injury. Nevertheless, some common risk factors have been identified. Situational factors that contribute to NFCI include immobility, inadequate or wet clothing, constricting boots and clothing, inadequate fluid or caloric intake, and fatigue and stress, especially in combat. Associated injuries or underlying circulatory problems, including peripheral vascular disease or Raynaud phenomenon, may contribute to the risk or severity of NFCI. Diabetes causes circulatory problems that may predispose to NFCI. Smoking, older age, and ethnicity may play a role, but data are lacking. Mental illness and alcohol use are also likely risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784464582\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR WARM WATER IMMERSION INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk factor for warm water immersion foot (WWIF) and tropical immersion foot (TIF) is continuous exposure of the feet to water at or above 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) without an opportunity for drying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonfreezing-cold-water-trench-foot-and-warm-water-immersion-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The duration of each stage varies considerably among patients. Transitions between stages may be abrupt or gradual.</p><p>In the <strong>First stage: During cold exposure</strong>, the key finding is loss of sensation. This usually takes the form of complete anesthesia. Patients complain of &quot;numbness,&quot; sometimes describing feet or hands as feeling like a block of wood. Due to this loss of sensation and proprioception, patients may become clumsy and may have difficulty walking. Extremities may be bright red at first but then become pale or completely white due to extreme vasoconstriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F116323\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116323 \">picture 9</a>). The extremity is usually painless unless rewarming is attempted.</p><p>The <strong>Second stage: Following cold exposure</strong> begins as soon as the patient is removed from the cold environment and continues during and after rewarming. This stage usually lasts just a few hours but may persist for as long as several days. The extremities become a mottled pale blue, reflecting a slight increase in blood flow. The color change can be hard to see in darkly pigmented skin. Peripheral pulses are initially thready. Subsequently, pulses become bounding, but capillary refill is delayed. The extremity continues to be cold and numb. Some swelling can occur. The patient may still have problems walking.</p><p>The <strong>Third stage: Hyperemia</strong> typically begins abruptly and lasts for days to weeks. In severe cases, the third stage lasts 6 to 10 weeks. The affected extremity becomes bright red and edematous with bounding pulses but with delayed capillary refill, reflecting microcirculatory damage. Anesthesia is replaced by intense pain with hyperalgesia. However, the distal areas of the affected extremities may remain anesthetic. Tissue damage is usually not apparent, but highly damaged areas may develop blistering. Nonviable areas of tissue are rare but may become blistered or discolored before developing necrosis in the fourth stage.</p><p>The <strong>Fourth stage: Following hyperemia </strong>may end after a few weeks, persist for years, or be permanent. The affected extremity usually appears normal, unless there has been tissue necrosis, which is uncommon. Affected extremities are cool and are often very sensitive to cold. Vasoconstriction in response to cold is common. Extremities may remain cool for hours after a brief exposure to cold. The majority of patients have chronic pain, usually in response to cold.

If there was no exposure to below-freezing temperatures, frostbite can be ruled out. Diagnosis of NFCI depends on a history of prolonged exposure to cold (generally 0 to 15&deg;C), wet conditions, and clinical findings consistent with the four stages of injury described above. The primary alternative diagnosis is frostbite. Frostbite that has been thawed may become hyperemic and swollen within hours, but a sharp demarcation between distal affected and proximal unaffected tissue distinguishes frostbite from NFCI.

Pain is increased by weight-bearing. The skin is initially cool but becomes warm within 12 hours. Wet-sock abrasion and small ulcerations over pressure points, where the footwear puts pressure on swollen tissue of the feet or ankles, are common.

Nevertheless, frostbite and NFCI can coexist, making diagnosis difficult. Like NFCI, frostbite can initially have a pale appearance. However, unlike tissue with NFCI, frostbitten tissue that is still frozen appears waxy and feels firm.</p><p>After thawing, frostbitten hands or feet can become hyperemic and swollen. Unlike NFCI, frostbitten tissue becomes purplish after thawing with a demarcation between affected and unaffected tissue on the digits, hands, or feet. Formation of blisters in the first 24 hours can occur in frostbite but is unusual in NFCI. Blisters that occur in the initial course of NFCI are due to pressure-induced injury.

If there is exposure to wet, cold conditions, either condition may coexist with and complicate NFCI. Tissue necrosis occurring in dry conditions is more commonly due to pressure-induced injury, ACS, or a combination of the two, even in the setting of cold exposure.</p><p>A history of immobility without cold exposure or the presence of typical pressure sores over bony prominences suggests isolated pressure-induced injury. Pressure-related ulcerations associated with immersion foot develop when footwear restricts further swelling and places pressure on soft tissues that are already swollen. Lesions generally occur on soft tissues rather than bony prominences.</p><p>ACS most often develops following significant trauma (eg, long bone fracture) but may occur from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Important findings with ACS include progressive pain out of proportion to the injury accompanied by tense, swollen compartments. ACS is a surgical emergency diagnosed by measuring elevated compartment pressures and treated with fasciotomy.

NFCI involves injury to the soft tissues, nerves, and vasculature of distal extremities from prolonged exposure (usually two to three days or longer) to wet, cold (but nonfreezing; generally 0 to 15&deg;C or 32 to 59&deg;F) conditions. Most often feet are involved, but the condition can affect any dependent body part. NFCI has been reported most often in combat soldiers, but other populations at risk include hikers, the homeless, alcoholics, and older adults. (See <a href=\"#H1063913891\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4291211273\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of nonfreezing cold injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm water immersion foot (WWIF) is a transient syndrome that manifests as painful, white, wrinkled soles of the feet due to immersion in warm water (15 to 32&deg;C; 59 to 90&deg;F) for up to 72 hours. Tropical immersion foot (TIF) is a more severe warm water immersion syndrome characterized by an inability to walk due to painful, swollen feet after immersion in warm water (22 to 32&deg;C; 72 to 90&deg;F) for over 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H1063913891\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2661035479\" class=\"local\">'Warm water immersion injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NFCI is characterized by impaired control of circulation and direct damage to the microcirculation, but the mechanism of cold and warm water immersion syndromes is poorly understood. The duration of a single exposure at a given temperature that is necessary to cause NFCI is not known, nor are there quantitative estimates of the effects of repeated exposure. Cold alone, without moisture, does not seem to be sufficient to cause NFCI. Immobility and malnutrition appear to contribute to injury in many cases. (See <a href=\"#H1022976057\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of nonfreezing cold injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3472231421\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of warm water immersion injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3251988126\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremities with NFCI progress through a series of stages that can vary considerably in duration: (See <a href=\"#H2805877661\" class=\"local\">'Nonfreezing cold injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>First stage: During cold exposure</strong> &ndash; The key finding in this stage is loss of sensation, which usually takes the form of complete anesthesia. Patients complain of &quot;numbness.&quot; Due to diminished sensation and proprioception, patients may have difficulty walking. Extremities may be bright red at first but then become pale or completely white (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027 \">picture 1</a>). The extremity is usually painless.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Second stage: Following cold exposure</strong> &ndash; This stage begins as soon as the patient is removed from the cold and continues during and after rewarming. It usually lasts a few hours but may persist as long as several days. Affected extremities become a mottled pale blue, reflecting a slight increase in blood flow (which may be hard to see in darkly pigmented skin). Peripheral pulses are initially thready; subsequently, pulses become bounding, but capillary refill is delayed. The extremities continue to be cold and numb. Difficulty walking may persist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Third stage: Hyperemia</strong> &ndash; This stage typically begins abruptly and lasts for days to weeks. The affected extremity becomes bright red and edematous with bounding pulses but with delayed capillary refill. Anesthesia is replaced by intense pain with hyperalgesia. Tissue damage is usually not apparent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fourth stage: Following hyperemia</strong> &ndash; This stage may end after a few weeks, persist for years, or be permanent. The affected extremity usually appears normal, unless there has been tissue necrosis, which is uncommon. Affected extremities are cool and are often very sensitive to cold. Chronic pain, usually in response to cold, and hyperhidrosis are common. (See <a href=\"#H2670438252\" class=\"local\">'Complications of nonfreezing cold injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NFCI is a clinical diagnosis; no specific imaging or laboratory studies are useful for establishing the diagnosis, and such studies are generally unnecessary to manage routine cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for water immersion injuries includes frostbite, pressure-induced soft tissue injury (which may coexist with immersion injury), and soft tissue infection. (See <a href=\"#H1551881323\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of nonfreezing cold injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3719215188\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of warm water immersion injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key elements in the treatment of NFCI are summarized below; details are provided in the text:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If present, treat systemic hypothermia before treating local cold injury. Examine the patient closely for other conditions and injuries. Assess extremities for frostbite and treat as necessary. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=accidental-hypothermia-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Accidental hypothermia in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frostbite\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frostbite&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not actively rewarm extremities with isolated NFCI. Rapid rewarming increases pain and edema. Extremities with NFCI should be allowed to rewarm gradually with bed rest, elevation of the legs or hands, and air-drying at room temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Replace fluid losses, which may be substantial. Use isotonic intravenous fluids warmed to 42&deg;C to both rehydrate and prevent hypothermia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Give tetanus prophylaxis. Do not give prophylactic treatment for other infections or for pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids may be administered initially for pain relief but are usually ineffective. We suggest treating pain as soon as it begins with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> (50 to 100 mg orally at bedtime) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Higher doses can be given for breakthrough pain. If amitriptyline is not effective, neuropathic pain medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> can be administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obtain immediate surgical consultation for any sign of possible tissue necrosis, such as hemorrhagic blistering.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm water immersion injuries generally heal without need of significant medical interventions.
