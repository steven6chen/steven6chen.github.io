While still not commonplace, a dramatic increase occurred early in the HIV pandemic and <em>R. equi</em> has increasingly been appreciated, especially as an opportunistic pathogen. Increasing recognition of <em>R. equi</em> as a pathogen has subsequently led to improved laboratory identification of infections in both immunocompromised and normal humans.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of <em>R. equi</em> infections will be reviewed here.

Extrapulmonary disease, with or without a concurrent pulmonary infection, can also occur. In one large review of 72 cases, pneumonia occurred in 76 percent of patients, and the lung was the sole site of infection in 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Cavitation arises in greater than 50 percent of cases and pleural effusion in approximately 20 percent. Invasion of contiguous chest structures (chest wall, pericardium, mediastinum) and recurrent pneumothorax are unusual complications.</p><p>Malacoplakia, a rare chronic granulomatous condition, can also occur in the setting of <em>R. equi</em> infection. Although malacoplakia is a nonspecific finding when seen elsewhere, when seen in lung parenchyma, it is generally more specific to <em>R. equi</em>. Pathologically, malakoplakia appears as a dense tissue infiltrate, comprising sheets of foamy histiocytes, with abundant cytoplasm-containing coccobacilli, and extra- or intracellular, target-like, calcific inclusions (Michaelis Gutmann bodies) that likely represent infected phagocytes with ingested bacteria which likely behave as a nidus for mineralization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Extrapulmonary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary infection depend upon whether the patient has concurrent pulmonary disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89986014\"><span class=\"h4\">With concurrent pulmonary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infection, the most common extrapulmonary sites are the skin (subcutaneous abscesses) and brain.

Kidney and bone involvement, as well as isolated bacteremia, may also be seen.

Patients with AIDS have the highest rate of accompanying bacteremia. The magnitude of the bacteremia may correlate with the risk of hematogenous dissemination. Occasionally, the isolation of <em>R. equi</em> from blood or tissue is the first clue to the etiology of an infection. If <em>R. equi</em> infection is diagnosed in an apparently normal host, further evaluation of the patient's immune status should be pursued.

The duration of therapy is described below (see <a href=\"#H2229789861\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> below). Specific considerations regarding the individual agents include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macrolides</strong> &ndash; In general, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (500 mg once as a loading dose, then 250 mg once daily); of the macrolides, it is most convenient due to once-daily dosing, and also has the least CYP 450 3A4 interaction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clarithromycin</a> (500 mg twice daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> stearate (500 mg four times daily) can also be used. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> levels may become elevated when administered with macrolides (especially erythromycin and clarithromycin). Thus, in organ transplant recipients, tacrolimus and cyclosporine levels need to be monitored and adjusted appropriately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluoroquinolones</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Moxifloxacin</a> (400 mg once a day), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> (500 mg once daily), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (750 mg twice daily) have activity against <em>R. equi</em>.

However, rifampin is associated with significant drug interactions. As an example, coadministration of rifampin and HIV protease inhibitors should be avoided. In addition, rifampin usually causes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> levels to plummet. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a> can be used instead of rifampin to decrease the risk of certain drug interactions, dose adjustments may still be required.

Although there are case reports of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a> being used for <em>R. equi</em> infections, imipenem is generally preferable as the initial choice of therapy until susceptibility data are available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Linezolid</a> &ndash; We generally administer linezolid as 600 mg every 12 hours, although some experts use once-daily dosing (600 mg every 24 hours) for these more slow-growing infections to reduce cytopenias and increase tolerability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aminoglycosides</strong> &ndash; Some clinicians might add an aminoglycoside for extensive pulmonary disease or metastatic disease.

Rates of resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> likely preclude use of this agent until susceptibility has been demonstrated. Beta-lactams (such as cephalosporins) should generally be avoided, even if initial susceptibility testing is favorable, since resistance has been shown to develop during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/27,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,46,47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2229789861\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial therapy in immunocompromised persons should last at least two months due to the frequency of relapses following shorter courses.

Longer courses should be administered to patients who have persistent clinical or radiographic evidence of infection.</p><p>Secondary prophylaxis should be administered to patients who remain immunosuppressed, as such patients are likely to suffer relapses.

In one case, an immune reconstitution syndrome secondary to <em>Rhodococcus</em> was reported with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

By contrast, hosts with normal immune function generally can be cured of <em>R. equi</em> infection.

Pulmonary infections are the most common form of human disease. However, extrapulmonary disease, with or without a concurrent pulmonary infection, can also occur. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In immunocompromised patients, the onset of pulmonary infection is typically subacute, but subsequently results in high fever, cough (which may or may not be productive), and prominent fatigue. Cavitation arises in greater than 50 percent of cases and pleural effusion in approximately 20 percent. (See <a href=\"#H3392292684\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary infection depend upon whether the patient has concurrent pulmonary disease. For immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infection, the most common extrapulmonary sites are the skin (subcutaneous abscesses) and brain. If extrapulmonary infection is not associated with pulmonary disease, patients can present with wound infections, peritoneal catheter-related infections, or isolated bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Extrapulmonary infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although uncommon, pneumonia due to <em>R. equi</em> has also been described in immunocompetent hosts. Most cases have had cavitary lesions on chest roentgenograms; extrapulmonary complications have not been reported. (See <a href=\"#H2606844895\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of <em>R. equi</em> infection should be suspected in immunocompromised patients with cavitary lung disease and epidemiologic risk factors for disease. A diagnosis is typically made by culturing the organism from a clinical specimen. <em>R. equi</em> is easily cultivated on ordinary nonselective media. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstay of treatment for <em>R. equi</em> is antimicrobial therapy. For immunocompromised hosts, we suggest combination therapy with at least two agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach is based upon concerns for emerging resistance. We typically initiate therapy with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, or in combination with two of the following: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>, or an aminoglycoside.
