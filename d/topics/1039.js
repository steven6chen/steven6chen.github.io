Identification of these factors, such as intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy, is important clinically because they can be treated, possibly preventing or minimizing further glomerular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. A review of the mechanisms by which these alterations might occur and how they might induce glomerular injury is available elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important component of this approach is antihypertensive therapy, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The experimental studies supporting this approach will be reviewed here. The clinical trials and recommendations are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREFERENTIAL EFFECT OF ACE INHIBITORS ON RENAL HEMODYNAMICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From a therapeutic viewpoint, lowering the systemic blood pressure is beneficial in a variety of experimental renal diseases, at least in part by reducing the intraglomerular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/1,2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4-6</a>]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to be particularly effective in this regard; this effect may be related to reversal of the angiotensin II-induced increase in resistance at the efferent or postglomerular arteriole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Dilatation of the efferent arteriole will facilitate blood movement out of the glomerulus, lowering the intraglomerular pressure independent of any change in systemic blood pressure. A brief review of the actions of angiotensin II on glomerular hemodynamics is available elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is presumed that the deleterious effect of angiotensin II represents <strong>local generation</strong> since circulating levels are normal or reduced (due to volume expansion) in many patients with chronic renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure, for example, endothelial injury or activation is associated with enhanced expression of angiotensinogen mRNA, which may then lead to increases in angiotensinogen and angiotensin II production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin receptor blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data in animal models concerning the efficacy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in protecting against progressive renal failure are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some studies have found that angiotensin II receptor antagonists are as effective as ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, other experimental studies have shown that angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) had a lesser antiproteinuric effect than ACE inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. This difference appeared to be mediated by kinins, which contribute to efferent arteriolar dilatation and the desirable reduction in intraglomerular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. ACE is also a kininase; thus, kinin levels increase after ACE inhibition, an effect not seen with angiotensin II receptor antagonists.</p><p>With experimental models, some variability in results may be due to differences in dosing, with most drug dosing being based upon the maximal effects observed on blood pressure. In some experimental studies, much higher levels of angiotensin-I receptor are noted in renal parenchyma than in vascular smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This suggests that higher doses of ARBs may be required to effectively block renal parenchymal receptors than the doses used to lower the blood pressure. These much higher doses may confer effects beyond that obtained with blood pressure lowering, particularly decreased inflammation and superior nephroprotection.</p><p>This hypothesis was evaluated in the <span class=\"nowrap\">5/6</span> renal ablation model in which conventional doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> (L50) were compared with 10-fold higher doses of losartan (L500) as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a></span> (HH) at doses to obtain similar blood pressure effects as with high dose losartan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among the effects measured, glomerular pressure and glomerular filtration rate were similar with both L50 and L500, although blood pressure and renal vascular resistance were lower with L500. Although renal injury and albuminuria were partially reduced by L50 at 4 months post-surgery, L500 completely arrested renal inflammation and injury and was associated with regression of albuminuria. This finding suggests that full blockade of angiotensin-I receptor blockers requiring much higher doses of ARBs may be associated with maximum nephroprotection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other antihypertensive drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, diuretics, and beta blockers, are less likely to reverse intraglomerular hypertension (because they do not produce preferential efferent dilatation) and therefore may be less likely to protect against progressive glomerular injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53771 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>]. Hydralazine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, for example, appear to produce prominent afferent or preglomerular arteriolar dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/5,6,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,19,20</a>]. Decreased resistance at this site will allow more of the systemic pressure to be transmitted to the glomerulus, possibly producing no change or even an elevation in intraglomerular pressure despite the associated reduction in systemic blood pressure. Increased efferent resistance also may occur, as the drug-induced vasodilatation leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In comparison to nifedipine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, the other calcium channel blockers &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> &ndash; are less potent vasodilators and may primarily decrease the resistance at the efferent arteriole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/18,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21</a>].</p><p>Studies using calcium channel blockers in experimental models of renal disease have revealed conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>]: some have shown increasing proteinuria (consistent with a rise in intraglomerular pressure) and little protection against glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], while others have shown benefit by mechanisms that may in part be independent of the intraglomerular pressure.

This protective effect also may occur in extrarenal vessels, as the degree of vascular hypertrophy in hypertensive animals with renal disease is less following therapy with an ACE inhibitor than with the triad of a thiazide diuretic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reserpine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">reserpine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Inhibition of local angiotensin II generation may be responsible for this vasculoprotective effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin II, either directly or via increased glomerular pressure, can enhance the release of extracellular matrix and collagen from mesangial and tubular cells, thereby promoting both glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/8,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22-25</a>]. This effect is mediated at least in part by enhanced release of transforming growth factor-beta, matrix proteins, platelet-derived growth, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/8,24,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24,26-29</a>].

Due to these effects, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers may help to reverse renal sclerosis, as observed in multiple animal models of progressive kidney dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/28,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ACE inhibitor may directly improve the size selective properties of the glomerulus, thereby preventing the accumulation of macromolecules in the mesangium and a secondary increase in mesangial matrix production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
