These infections include dacryocystitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, and orbital cellulitis. The pathogen can also be directly introduced into the cornea, anterior chamber, or vitreous via trauma or surgery. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> has been implicated in some cases of ophthalmia neonatorum and scleral abscesses. Hematogenous infection of the vitreous occurs rarely in patients with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-endophthalmitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial endophthalmitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;, section on 'Bacterial conjunctivitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Corneal and conjunctival infections</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42034467\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical syndromes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Corneal infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corneal infections due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> usually result from minor trauma to the cornea. These infections may manifest as focal or diffuse inflammation of the cornea (keratitis) or as corneal ulcers if inflammation results in tissue loss and corneal erosion. </p><p>In particular, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is the most common cause of bacterial keratitis among contact lens wearers. Pseudomonas keratitis has been observed among patients using hydrophilic lenses and extended wear lenses, as the polymer matrix provides a suitable surface for <em>Pseudomonas</em> adherence. Extended lens wearing provides more time for lens surface coatings to accumulate, which promotes further bacterial adherence. Lens wear can then lead to bacterial accumulation on ocular surface by shielding the cornea from the immune components found in tears and from the wiping action of the eyelids. Although poor lens care practices such as use of contaminated solutions or tap water to clean lenses is commonly reported among affected individuals, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can colonize contact lenses despite proper lens hygiene. </p><p>Traumatic epithelial defects also play a very important role in promoting keratitis secondary to contact lenses. Previous experimental models showed that corneal disease develops predominantly in corneas exposed to trauma, which can occur during lens insertion or removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other predisposing conditions include use of topical steroids for other ocular diseases, contaminated ocular medications, and prior ocular irradiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;, section on 'Infectious keratitis'</a>.)</p><p><em>P. aeruginosa</em> corneal ulcers usually start with a small lesion that rapidly spreads concentrically and internally, in some cases leading to corneal perforation over a 48-hour period. Corneal ulcers can also be indolent, evolving slowly over days to weeks. Clinical findings include eye redness, decreased visual acuity, pain, eyelid swelling, photophobia, yellow infiltrates, and corneal epithelial defects visualized by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> staining. Fever and other systemic manifestations are generally absent. Typically, there is a necrotic gray ulcer with adherent mucopurulent discharge and surrounding epithelial edema. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> corneal ulcers can result in secondary hypopyons or panophthalmitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Blepharoconjunctivis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Critically ill patients, neonates, or burn patients may develop unilateral or bilateral conjunctivitis due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. Conjunctival infection can occur with or without associated infection of the eyelids (blepharitis). Patients on mechanical ventilation are at increased risk for colonization of the eye with this organism, which can subsequently lead to conjunctivitis. Contamination of the conjunctiva with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can occur during tracheal suctioning, when ventilator intubation tubes are disconnected, allowing eye inoculation from aerosols or direct contact with secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a corneal ulcer, keratitis, or conjunctivitis due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can be easily confirmed by obtaining scrapings from the bed of the ulcer or the conjunctiva for Gram stain and culture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of corneal and conjunctival infections usually consists of topical and systemic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91115 \">table 1</a>) antipseudomonal agents.

Otitis externa due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is common in swimmers and in residents of tropical or humid climates. In a prospective study of 99 cases of otitis externa, the peak incidence occurred in summer and early autumn months; exposure to water and previous use of ear drops and cotton-tipped applicators predisposed to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast to acute otitis externa, chronic otitis externa is generally caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Patients with otitis externa typically complain of itching and pain, worsened by traction on the pinna. Characteristically, there is a thick purulent discharge from the ear, and on examination, the external auditory canal is usually tender, edematous, and occluded with debris.

Skull base osteomyelitis (also known as malignant external otitis) occurs when <em>P. aeruginosa</em> penetrates the epithelium of the external auditory canal and invades the underlying soft tissue, cartilage, and cortical bone. Infection may then occur in the soft tissue of the retromandibular and parotid spaces, the mastoid air cells, and the temporal bones. When the temporal bones become infected and necrotic, infection can spread to the base of the skull leading to inflammation and even necrosis of the ipsilateral seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth cranial nerves.</p><p>Patients with skull base osteomyelitis usually present with pain and discharge from the affected ear. Hearing loss may or may not be present. On examination, the external auditory canal usually appears swollen and inflamed with a purulent discharge. Adjacent structures such as the pinna, periauricular and retromandibular areas, and the mastoid tip may also show signs of inflammation. The tympanic membrane, which may be either intact or perforated, is often hidden by the swelling and the granulation tissue. Cranial nerve palsies appear later in the course. Trismus may occur from infection of the temporomandibular joint.</p><p>Prompt diagnosis and treatment of this infection is essential.

Otitis media due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can also occur in infants less than six weeks of age. The presence of this pathogen should be suspected when patients with otitis media fail to respond to usual antibiotic therapy. Neonates with otitis media due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> often have misleading symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, and difficulty in feeding, whereas older children with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> ear infections usually have signs and symptoms typical of otitis media.
