This cause may be genetic or acquired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lipid-disorders-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lipid disorders in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two principal genetic disorders causing extremely low levels of LDL-C have been identified. These two, &quot;abetalipoproteinemia&quot; and &quot;hypobetalipoproteinemia,&quot; are referred to as &quot;familial hypobetalipoproteinemia.&quot; Other less common disorders have been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4023651122\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholesterol measurement undertaken to screen for cardiovascular disease risk occasionally reveals unexpected hypocholesterolemia (LDL-C &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lipid-disorders-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lipid disorders in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This can be due to an inherited cause or may be due to an acquired disease. A careful history and physical examination is necessary with appropriate investigations, because many of the acquired causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114584 \">table 1</a>) require treatment and early detection may thus be beneficial. </p><p>When no acquired cause is found, it is often helpful to measure cholesterol in relatives of the patient, because the most common genetic cause of hypocholesterolemia, familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, is dominantly inherited.

MTP is responsible for the intracellular assembly of apolipoprotein B (apo B) and lipids in the liver and intestine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Apolipoproteins'</a>).&nbsp;Consequently, no apo B-containing lipoproteins are found in the plasma (and thus LDL-C levels are near zero), and this results in impaired transport of fat-soluble vitamins&nbsp;(A, D, E, K). This condition is manifest in infancy, and it is characterized by mental retardation and growth abnormalities.&nbsp;Some patients with abetalipoproteinemia can have peripheral neuropathies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroacanthocytosis#H1983214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroacanthocytosis&quot;, section on 'Abetalipoproteinemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3095807283\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOBETALIPOPROTEINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypobetalipoproteinemia is associated with mutations that may occur at multiple genetic loci, and the best-described cases show linkage to mutations in the gene encoding apolipoprotein B (apo B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The clinical manifestations include intestinal fat malabsorption, intraperitoneal fat, hepatic steatosis, and fat soluble vitamin deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].&nbsp;Monitoring for symptoms of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency is recommended. Measurement of fat-soluble vitamin levels is recommended with supplementation of the deficient vitamins as dictated by the magnitude of the vitamin deficiency. Patients have very low levels of plasma apo B and LDL-C (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> percentile of age- and sex-specific values; LDL-C levels between 25 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.65 and 1.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> as well as low levels of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A 2010 report of one family with hypobetalipoproteinemia <strong>not</strong> linked to apo B has not only shed light on the genetics lipid disorders, but has also raised the possibility of a new mechanism for LDL-C lowering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this family, premature coronary heart disease was absent. Four family members had very low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides. A relationship between ANGPTL3 and lipid levels was found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102848674\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILIAL COMBINED HYPOLIPIDEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) are regulators of lipoprotein metabolism and some of them decrease lipoprotein lipase activity. Loss-of-function genetic variants in the gene encoding for <em>ANGPTL3</em> and <em>ANGPTL4</em> have been identified. These variants are associated with increased lipoprotein lipase activity, as well as low levels of plasma LDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <em>ANGPTL3</em> causes familial combined hypolipidemia (<em>FHBL2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study that included 14 homozygotes, 8 compound heterozygotes, 93 heterozygotes, and 402 controls, carriers of two mutant alleles had no detectable <em>ANGPTL3</em> protein while heterozygotes had protein concentrations that ranged from 34 to 88 percent, depending on the genotype. As compared with controls, homozygotes and heterozygotes have reduced levels of all plasma lipoproteins except lipoprotein(a). <em>FHBL2</em> individuals had no differences in the risk of fatty liver disease, whereas homozygotes had no diabetes or cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Subsequent genetic and therapeutic studies, of which the following two are representative, have confirmed the association between low levels of <em>ANGPTL3</em> and decreased levels of LDL-C and triglycerides:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 58,335 participants in five cohorts whose DNA was available for analysis, individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function variants in <em>ANGPTL3</em> had significantly lower levels of triglyceride, HDL-C, and LDL-C than participants without those variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, loss-of-function variants were found in 0.33 percent of case patients with coronary artery disease and in 0.45 percent of controls (adjusted odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.85). A small phase 1 study evaluated the use of evinacumab (a human monoclonal antibody against <em>ANGPTL3</em>) in 83 individuals with varying degrees of dyslipidemia. The antibody led to a dose-dependent reduction in fasting triglyceride levels of up to 76 percent and LDL-C levels of up to 23 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 44 human participants, oligonucleotides targeting <em>ANGPTL3</em> mRNA led to reductions in levels of <em>ANGPTL3</em> protein between 47 and 85 percent, as well as significant reductions in levels of triglycerides and LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2055890790\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIANT ASGR1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two loss-of-function variants of <em>ASGR1</em>, which encodes a subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, have been identified (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor#H1551978020\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;, section on 'Clearance of VWF from the circulation'</a>). In individuals heterozygous for one or the other of these, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (which is predominantly LDL-C in most people) is significantly lower (approximately 15 mg per deciliter [0.40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> than in individuals without the haploinsufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The LDL-C level depends on the type of mutation. Nonsense mutations in one of two locations encoding Y142X and C679X are present in 2 percent of African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These nonsense mutations are associated with a 40 percent reduction LDL-C.

This variant is present in 3.2 compared with 0.6 percent of blacks, and it is associated with a 21 percent reduction in LDL-C. Compound heterozygosity for <em>PCSK9</em> loss-of-function variants is characterized by LDL-C levels of 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.

It is an autosomal recessive condition that presents in infancy with failure to thrive and steatorrhoea, abdominal distension, and vomiting. There is a profound deficiency of vitamin E and other fat soluble vitamins, which may have neurological consequences. Both LDL-C and high density lipoprotein cholesterol are low. Although chylomicron production is impaired, triglyceride levels are normal. Small bowel biopsy invariably shows fat-laden enterocytes, and hepatic steatosis is also frequent. Creatine kinase is raised. There is a mutation of <em>Sar1b</em> involved in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi in enterocytes. Treatment requires removal of long chain fatty acids from the diet, nutritional support, and supplements of fat soluble vitamins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186190827\"><span class=\"h1\">ACQUIRED LOW LDL-C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple diseases have been associated with low LDL-C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114584 \">table 1</a>). Low cholesterol may be present in carcinoma of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] or prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] before they are otherwise clinically evident. The low LDL-C is often accompanied by low high density lipoprotein cholesterol, but in contrast to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, triglyceride levels may be moderately elevated (for example: in malabsorption) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Chronic anemia can be associated with hypocholesterolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Multiple myelomatoses can be associated with hyperlipidemia, but in some cases with hypolipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-ldl-cholesterol/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].
