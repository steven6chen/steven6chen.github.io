The most common diseases in this group are ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA).</p><p>Diseases in the SpA family fall into one of two groups, axial SpA and peripheral SpA, but some patients have both axial and peripheral features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial SpA &ndash; These conditions involve the spine. AS and nr-axSpA are both types of axial SpA. Sometimes these patients also have involvement of joints in the arms and legs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral SpA &ndash; These conditions affect the joints of the arms and legs, fingers and toes, and heels. Some of these people have psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, or arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease).</p><p/><p>This topic discusses the symptoms, diagnostic tests, treatment, and complications of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Separate topic reviews are available that discuss in more detail some of the medications used to treat axSpA as well as exercises, such as stretching and strengthening, that can help. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Reactive arthritis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H628279171\"><span class=\"h1\">AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS SPECTRUM OF SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) share the common feature of back pain. However, there is a wide spectrum in terms of the severity of the disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At one end of the spectrum are people who, on X-ray, do not show any changes in the sacroiliac joints (the joints that connect the bottom of the spine to the pelvis) or the vertebrae (the bones of the spine). This is called <strong>nonradiographic axial SpA</strong> (nr-axSpA); &quot;nonradiographic&quot; means not visible on X-ray. A more sensitive test, usually magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is needed to detect changes in the sacroiliac joints in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, some people in the nr-axSpA category develop signs of radiologic changes, especially of the sacroiliac joints. Once the sacroiliac joints are clearly affected on X-ray, a person is said to have <strong>ankylosing spondylitis</strong> (AS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the other end of the spectrum, in some people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the sacroiliac joints as well as the vertebrae become fused into what doctors call a &quot;bamboo spine.&quot;</p><p/><p>Many people with nr-axSpA do not go on to have AS, and many people with AS do not advance to &quot;bamboo spine.&quot; The same treatments are effective in both nr-axSpA and AS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is pain in the lower back. Some people also have pain, stiffness, and limited mobility outside the spine, such as in the hips, knees, and heels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal pain, almost always in the lower back, is usually the first and most common symptom of axSpA. The pain generally has some of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begins in early adulthood (before 45 years of age)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a gradual onset (rather than sudden onset after an acute injury or a disc problem)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lasts longer than three months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is worse after rest (eg, in the morning)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improves with activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wakes you up in the second half of the night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can cause morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can be associated with buttock pain that alternates between the left and right sides</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited spinal flexibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited flexibility of the back and neck is more severe in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) than with nonradiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA). In AS, the degree of inflexibility ranges from minor to complete inflexibility. Limitations in flexibility of the back and neck can make it hard to do normal daily activities, such as putting on shoes and stockings. The most serious consequence is developing an irreversible head-forward &quot;hunchback&quot; posture. More normal posture can often be maintained by regularly performing posture training exercises. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy, exercise, and posture training'</a> below.)</p><p>You can test yourself for a hunchback posture by standing against a wall, with your back and heels touching the wall. Normally it is possible to touch the wall with the back of the head while keeping the chin parallel to the floor. If you cannot touch the wall with the back of the head, this indicates that you have a significant head-forward hunchback posture. If you are not already doing physical therapy and posture training to help with this, your doctor can help you get started.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other symptoms of axSpA can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue and sleeplessness &ndash; Inflammation in axSpA can affect the entire person, causing fatigue and sleeplessness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety and depression &ndash; These problems sometimes affect people with axSpA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip pain &ndash; Arthritis of the hips is relatively common in AS, but much less so in nr-axSpA. Hip arthritis can cause pains in the groin or buttocks or difficulty walking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heel pain &ndash; A common area of inflammation is the heel. This can cause pain at the back of the heel (Achilles tendinitis) and in the sole of the foot (plantar fasciitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder pain &ndash; Inflammation of the tendon and bone may cause shoulder pain and limited mobility of the affected shoulder(s).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis in other joints &ndash; Pain, stiffness, and swelling of other joints may occur. Arthritis may affect a single joint (monoarthritis) or a few joints (oligoarthritis). This is mainly seen in the hips, knees, ankles, heels, and feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Sausage-digits&quot; &ndash; Sausage-shaped swelling can affect one or several toes and fingers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other organs &ndash; Body systems other than the joints can be affected. (See <a href=\"#H28475399\" class=\"local\">'Problems outside the spine or the joints'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The combination of symptoms varies from person to person. The diagnosis of AS or nr-axSpA must be made by a clinician and cannot be made using an itemized checklist. It depends on the combination of symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, and imaging findings. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Axial spondyloarthritis diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28475230\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of certain SpA symptoms varies greatly between people and also fluctuates in each individual. Periods in which a person's symptoms become worse are called &quot;flares.&quot; The goal of therapy is major improvement of symptoms, to achieve a &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; remission. Because several symptoms are involved, it can be useful to combine estimates of the severity of each of the major symptoms (pain, stiffness, and fatigue) into one number. This provides a simple way of measuring and tracking overall &quot;disease activity.&quot;</p><p>One way to measure the disease activity without obtaining laboratory tests is by using a questionnaire that you can complete on your own called the &quot;Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index&quot; (BASDAI). A web-based version of the BASDAI is available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bath-ankylosing-spondylitis-disease-activity-index-basdai-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). This information can help your doctors decide what treatments to try and whether or not a treatment you have started is effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) are usually diagnosed in young adults between the ages of 20 and 30 years.</p><p>The disease can be more common in certain families. For example, a person's risk of developing axSpA increases if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) has axSpA. The presence of a gene called human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 also increases the risk of developing axSpA.</p><p>Smoking is the single most important risk factor you can change for developing more severe disease. If you are a smoker and have been diagnosed with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), you should try to quit as soon as possible. Your health care provider can help you make a plan to quit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultimately, the diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) must be made by an experienced clinician and is based upon a combination of symptoms, physical examination, blood tests, and imaging tests such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on the results, a clinician can assign a degree of probability to whether axSpA is causing your symptoms. The diagnosis cannot be made by ticking a checklist.</p><p>For some people, observations for months or years might be necessary before a clinician can be confident of the diagnosis. In general, axSpA should be considered if you have daily back pain for more than three months that starts before the age of 45, especially if this back pain is predominantly present in the morning and improves after movement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no blood tests that, by themselves, can definitively diagnose or exclude axSpA. However, testing for the presence of one particular type of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene, HLA-B27, can be helpful in certain people. AxSpA is less likely in a person with a negative test for HLA-B27 who is white and of European descent. Tests for proteins called &quot;acute phase reactants&quot; are sometimes helpful but are not diagnostic for axSpA; these tests, which are markers of inflammation in the body, include C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28475296\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with axSpA develop characteristic changes in the sacroiliac joints. These are the joints that connect the base of the spine (sacrum) to the large pelvic bone (ilium) on both sides. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), these changes can be seen on radiograph (X-ray) images.</p><p>Imaging tests such as MRI detect the disease earlier than plain X-rays. In nonradiographic (nr)-axSpA, findings suggesting inflammation in the sacroiliac joints may be present on MRI when the X-rays are negative. The interpretation of both the X-ray and the MRI requires training and, to a certain extent, is observer-dependent. Two clinicians might not agree on the same X-ray or MRI. Imaging tests should always be interpreted in the context of the symptoms, physical examination, and blood tests.</p><p>In people already diagnosed with AS, radiographs of the vertebrae are also useful in assessing the degree of structural damage to the spine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment approaches to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) are similar. A number of treatments are available; the selection is tailored for each individual, based on the characteristics and severity of the disease. Treatment may include some or all of the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy, exercise, and posture training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is best to start exercising as soon as possible after being diagnosed with axSpA and to continue exercising regularly. Exercise should be part of the treatment program for everyone with axSpA. It can include home exercises, individual or group exercise with a physical therapist, or individual physical therapy treatments. It can be &quot;land-based&quot; or in a pool, with or without additional therapies. Optimally, you should be evaluated and given instructions by a physical therapist and be monitored periodically.</p><p>The minimum exercise program includes core strengthening and should also contain cardiovascular exercises, isometric strengthening (exercising muscles while holding a position rather than through motion), breathing, stretching, and dynamic movements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because axSpA can lead to the spine becoming &quot;frozen&quot; in an awkward posture, posture training is very important. Modern sedentary life often involves sitting in a slumped posture in front of a computer, which causes shortening of the muscles at the back of the thighs, tilting of the hips forward, weakening of the muscles of the upper back, and a tendency to bend and hold the neck and head too far forward. A vigorous posture training program should be aimed at compensating for these issues. A video to help you check your own posture is available from the <a href=\"http://www.nass.co.uk/&amp;token=gdEMl/3RV4q6xsBHuH4h8uGySiwGQP/AH9OG9ZnnVJg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=577\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society</a>.</p><p>Other exercises with a mind-body component may be of benefit, including tai chi and Pilates. (See <a href=\"#H1196048837\" class=\"local\">'Complementary (alternative) medicines'</a> below.)</p><p>Instructions on exercises designed for people with axSpA are also available. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28475326\"><span class=\"h2\">Support groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support groups for axSpA are available in the United States (<a href=\"http://www.spondylitis.org/&amp;token=ax6F1OeSk4PORFgEeTQE8yi9iu0Y1Is4hvUsk4wJhyDJY8z/0texDzcP5gJmRszw&amp;TOPIC_ID=577\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Spondylitis Association of America</a>) and many other countries. Participating in a support group can be a helpful coping strategy, especially if you are struggling with your condition and how it has impacted your life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289015719\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fused, immobile, inflexible spine is more easily fractured than a normal spine. Because of the increased risk of serious spinal injury from even minor falls or other accidents, people with axSpA with an inflexible spine should take care to avoid such mishaps. Safety measures you can take include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Narcotic pain-relieving drugs (such as codeine) and sedatives (sleeping pills) should be used cautiously, if at all, since these also increase the risk of falling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modify your home to decrease your risk of falling. Shower or tub grab-bars and nightlights decrease the chance of a fall. Remove or secure loose rugs, and keep walkways free of clutter, electrical cords, and other things that could be tripped over.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take precautions in the car. Seatbelts reduce the risk of injury in a car crash and should always be worn while driving or riding in a vehicle. A wraparound rearview mirror can improve visibility while driving if you cannot turn your head and neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid developing deformities of the neck, use a thin, rather than thick, pillow for sleeping.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have an inflexible spine, avoid contact sports and other high-impact activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform fall-prevention exercises as part of your exercise program.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3980476139\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no special dietary recommendations for axSpA other than maintaining a healthy diet. There is a lack of evidence for benefit from the intake of probiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to control pain and stiffness. NSAIDs need to be taken on a regular basis for several weeks before their maximum effect can be judged. If one NSAID is not effective, your doctor might try another one. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415913644\"><span class=\"h3\">Opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids (narcotics) are a group of medications that can relieve pain in certain situations. Opioids can cause side effects, some of which can be serious. They can also lead to misuse and addiction in some people. In general, people with axSpA and chronic pain should <strong>not</strong> use opioids. You should only take them if your clinician has prescribed them after a detailed discussion about their relative risks and benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Sulfasalazine and methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that may be prescribed for people with axSpA who also suffer from peripheral arthritis (affecting joints outside the spine). This drug provides some relief of arthritis symptoms but is not helpful for axial (spine) symptoms. It may be given along with NSAIDs. Methotrexate might also be effective for peripheral arthritis but is not for axial symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-and-the-5-aminosalicylates-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sulfasalazine and the 5-aminosalicylates (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A group of medicines known as anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (anti-TNF agents or TNF inhibitors) are often effective in the treatment of axSpA. Examples of anti-TNF medications include infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab. People who do not respond to one anti-TNF treatment may respond to another. Improvement in symptoms is common and may occur within a few weeks of starting the drugs.</p><p>Not every person with axSpA needs anti-TNF therapy. In general, people with active disease in the spine who have not responded fully to NSAIDs may be candidates. (See <a href=\"#H28475230\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of disease activity'</a> above.)</p><p>Your clinician may also recommend a glucocorticoid (cortisone-like drug) injection into painful or swollen peripheral joints before starting an anti-TNF drug if these areas continue to bother you despite using NSAIDs (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids (steroids)'</a> below) or DMARD therapy. The decision to use anti-TNF therapy depends upon several factors that should be discussed with your clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590201114\"><span class=\"h3\">Secukinumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secukinumab (brand name: Cosentyx) may be an alternative treatment option for some people who do not respond adequately to anti-TNF therapy. Secukinumab can also be used as a first biologic for AS, especially in people who are not candidates for a TNF-blocker therapy for other reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids (steroids)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinicians may also recommend a glucocorticoid injection into particularly painful or swollen joints, especially if only one or two areas are causing the most pain. Glucocorticoid injections might also be helpful for inflammation of a tendon or bursa or the sacroiliac joints.</p><p>By contrast, taking glucocorticoids by mouth is not indicated in axSpA treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip or spine surgery may be beneficial in some people with axSpA. Surgical procedures may include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Total hip replacement (arthroplasty)</strong> &ndash; Insertion of an artificial (prosthetic) hip may be recommended if you have severe, persistent hip pain or severely limited mobility due to hip joint arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal surgery</strong> &ndash; Fusion of the bones in the cervical (upper) spine may be recommended for a very small number of people who develop dislocation of these bones. Such surgery may help prevent spinal cord damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wedge osteotomy</strong> &ndash; Wedge osteotomy involves the removal of a wedge-shaped piece of bone from a vertebra, followed by realignment of the spine. The spine is then braced and is allowed to heal in a better position. This type of procedure may be recommended for people who have severe deformities of the neck and upper back.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1196048837\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary (alternative) medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercises with a mind-body component, including tai chi and Pilates, may help some people. Evidence is lacking for benefit from complementary and alternative therapies (ie, treatments or techniques that are not part of mainstream medicine), such as probiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1434316647\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW DO I COPE WITH AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS?</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5947307\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological well-being</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to physical symptoms, some people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) also have feelings of sadness or frustration, and a sense that they are missing out on a lot of activities or letting people down. Brain imaging studies show that some people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) even have changes in activities and structures of the brain associated with mood (happiness, sadness, etc).</p><p>There are two types of coping strategies. One is passive coping, in which you rely totally on medications or your clinicians for help. The other is active coping, in which you rebuild your psychological defense systems through approaches such as mindfulness, cognitive behavior therapy, and positive psychology. Aerobic exercises and participating in patient-organized groups are also types of active coping strategies that can help. (See <a href=\"#H28475326\" class=\"local\">'Support groups'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2997445718\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AxSpA can affect daily life in various ways. Dressing, reaching, rising from a chair, getting up from the floor, standing, climbing steps, looking to the side or over the shoulder, exercising, and doing household and other work-related tasks can become more difficult as a result of the limited joint and spinal motion.</p><p>Depending on your degree of physical limitation, you may need help from family and friends in order to do your normal daily activities. A web-based, self-administered questionnaire tool (the <a href=\"http://east-kent-rheumatology.co.uk/wordpress/basfi-calculator/&amp;token=lqr4dmtHQg2oTQLtISy/G1md1uIIYx31QaMnFekEdUBthNfvC/AZJnaQuDO4I9ldvPOV3hqr2QEwbWJA9uEmsBwZccOo/Gt7eG5ykZWfMRc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=577\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index</a> [BASFI]) is available for assessing the degree of functional impairment. More in-depth evaluations into the quality of life and psychological well-being include the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) and the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) Health Index.</p><p>If you are struggling to cope with your disease in any way, talk to your health care providers and support groups. They can suggest different resources and approaches that can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28475399\"><span class=\"h1\">PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE SPINE OR THE JOINTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the possible clinical problems outside the spine and the joints, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. To a lesser extent, people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) might suffer from psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior uveitis</strong> &ndash; Uveitis, or inflammation of part of the eye, is the most common axSpA-related problem that does not involve the joints. Anterior uveitis affects the iris (the colored part of the eye). It causes pain in the eye, blurring of vision, and light sensitivity. Uveitis requires immediate medical attention and treatment with eye medications. It is usually responsive to treatment with eye drops and often resolves within several months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psoriasis</strong> &ndash; Psoriasis is a skin condition that might affect people with axSpA. In psoriasis, areas of the skin are thickened and red, and these may be covered with white or silvery scales. Sometimes the nails are involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> &ndash; Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, which is an inflammatory condition of the bowel, sometimes coexists with axSpA. Inflammatory bowel disease can cause abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhea, and bloody bowel movements. Also, shallow ulcerations in the lining of the bowels are observed in some people with axSpA. Such ulcerations do not usually cause any symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depression and fibromyalgia</strong> &ndash; Some patients with axSpA also develop depression, anxiety, and sometimes pain from fibromyalgia (a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain, fatigue, poor sleep, and poor concentration). These conditions should be evaluated and treated as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular disease</strong> &ndash; There is a possibility that people with axSpA may have a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack. Because of this, it is a good idea to minimize other factors that may increase this risk. This includes avoiding smoking, leading a healthy lifestyle, and getting treatment for high blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3738652423\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF LONGSTANDING ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following complications may happen in people with advanced ankylosing spondylitis (AS), although they are rare.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal fractures and spinal cord injuries</strong> &ndash; Spinal fractures and spinal cord injuries are, respectively, 4 and 11 times more common in patients with AS than in the general population. Most of the acute fractures occur in the neck. Because a spine affected by AS is more easily fractured than a healthy spine, in many cases, injury can result from even a low-impact activity or incident. Patients with spinal cord injuries may have only minor initial neurologic symptoms such as neck pain, numbness, or weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Any neck or spine injury requires immobilization, consultation with a doctor, and evaluation in an emergency facility. More than half of neck fractures in people with AS are undetectable by plain radiograph (X-ray). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive imaging techniques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic problems</strong> &ndash; Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication that occurs in people with longstanding disease who have severe stiffening of the spine. The symptoms result from damage to many nerves in the lower back and include abnormal sensation and weakness of the lower extremities and difficulty with bladder and bowel control. Men may experience erectile dysfunction or impotence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart valve disease</strong> &ndash; The most serious problem that can affect the heart is a leaking aortic valve (aortic regurgitation), which can cause symptoms of heart failure, including leg or ankle swelling (edema) and shortness of breath during exercise or exertion. This requires monitoring and, in some cases, treatment with medications or even surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary (lung) disease</strong> &ndash; Many people with AS are unable to fully expand the chest normally during breathing because of stiffness between the ribs and the spine. In some cases, there are actual changes in the lung tissues. This may or may not cause breathing problems.</p><p/><p>Because the severity and outcome of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) vary tremendously from person to person, treatment must be tailored to each individual. However, everyone with axSpA can benefit from the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking cigarettes, if you smoke. People who smoke and have AS can have problems with their breathing. AS can limit the movement of the chest and can reduce the amount of air the lungs can hold (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). People who smoke also progress to ankylosing spondylitis of the spine faster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain correct upright and sitting posture and participate in an exercise program.
