MEN2 is subclassified into two distinct syndromes: types 2A (MEN2A) and 2B (MEN2B). Within MEN2A, there are four variants: classical MEN2A, MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis (CLA), MEN2A with Hirschsprung disease (HD), and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101551 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The genetic defect in these disorders involves the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene on chromosome 10. MEN2A and 2B are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with very high penetrance. In both syndromes, there is an occurrence of multicentric tumor formation in all organs where the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene is expressed. The thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands are at risk for developing tumors that may reduce life expectancy and quality of life. The excellent prognosis for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) diagnosed at its earliest stage underscores the importance of early diagnosis for sporadic and hereditary MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of MEN2.

Most cases of MTC (75 percent) are sporadic, but as many as 25 percent of all MTCs are familial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85653 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among patients with MEN2, virtually all patients develop clinically apparent MTC, often early in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In MEN2A-associated MTC, the peak incidence of index cases is in the third decade of life, and it is usually earlier in MEN2B. Specific <em>RET</em> mutations are associated with characteristic age-specific penetrance of MTC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58578\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58578 \">table 3</a>), as well as characteristic prevalence of the extrathyroidal manifestations. MTCs in patients with MEN2 are multicentric and concentrated in the upper third of the thyroid gland, reflecting the normal distribution of parafollicular cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86206\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86206 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>If diagnosed as an index case, the clinical presentation and manifestations of MEN2-associated MTC are similar to those of sporadic MTC, except that sporadic MTC typically presents later in life. The most common presentation is that of a solitary thyroid nodule or cervical lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy shows eccentrically placed nuclei that are larger and more pleomorphic than those of normal follicular cells. The cytoplasm may be slightly granular and is usually configured as a tear drop or cytoplasmic tail. If the diagnosis is suspected, immunocytologic staining for calcitonin should be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H1589349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Less common presentations specific to MEN2-associated MTC include recognition during a search initiated after an associated disease (such as pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism) becomes apparent, diarrhea caused by gastrointestinal secretion of fluid and electrolytes, and flushing due to the secretion of other peptides by the tumor. In rare cases, MTC causes Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic production of corticotropin (ACTH). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In asymptomatic patients identified through calcitonin or DNA testing, initiated due to the presence of an associated disease or to a family history of MEN2, MTC is often diagnosed in its preneoplastic state, C-cell hyperplasia. Basal serum calcitonin concentrations usually correlate with tumor mass and are almost always high in patients with a palpable tumor. In patients with small tumors and those with C-cell hyperplasia, the values may be normal but rise excessively after calcium or pentagastrin infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5652421\" class=\"local\">'Choice of biochemical test for MTC'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of C-cell hyperplasia is defined based upon microscopy criteria: the presence of an increased number of diffusely scattered C cells (&ge;7 per thyroid follicle), complete follicles surrounded by C cells, or distribution of C cells beyond the normal anatomical location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. C-cell hyperplasia can occur in a reactive (secondary) form or a neoplastic form (precursor to MTC in MEN2). Neoplastic C-cell hyperplasia is diagnosed when nests of C cells appear to extend beyond the basement membrane and to infiltrate and destroy thyroid follicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86205\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86205 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Reactive C-cell hyperplasia is considered to be caused by a stimulus from outside the C cell and probably is not premalignant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85628\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85628 \">picture 3</a>). Hyperparathyroidism, chronic renal insufficiency, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and follicular thyroid tumors have been associated with reactive C-cell hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pheochromocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients with MEN2. The frequency of pheochromocytoma depends upon the specific underlying <em>RET</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Some <em>RET</em> mutations are associated with a higher penetrance of pheochromocytoma. As an example, in one study, the penetrance of pheochromocytoma was 25 percent by age 30 years, 52 percent by age 50 years, and 88 percent by age 77 years in patients with <em>RET</em> codon 634 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>As with MTC, pheochromocytomas in MEN2 occur earlier than sporadic forms. Although they may develop as early as 8 to 12 years of age, the mean age of presentation is 25 to 32 years, depending on the <em>RET</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. It is unusual for pheochromocytoma to precede the development of MTC and be the initial manifestation of MEN2. In patients who have undergone regular screening, pheochromocytomas have usually become evident approximately 10 years later than C-cell hyperplasia or MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, pheochromocytomas in MEN2 are usually identified during screening or through heightened vigilance for symptoms in patients with known or suspected MEN2.</p><p>Rarely, pheochromocytoma may be the first manifestation of MEN2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In such patients, symptoms are similar to those in patients with sporadic pheochromocytomas and may include attacks (paroxysms) of anxiety, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, or tachycardia. However, in one report, only approximately one-third had hypertension at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The severity of symptoms may depend upon the specific <em>RET</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma includes biochemical testing and, once a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is established, imaging studies. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic pheochromocytomas are almost always unilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In contrast, pheochromocytomas in MEN2 have been reported to be bilateral in approximately 30 to 100 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/14,20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20,23</a>]. Thus, once the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in MEN2 is established, the possibility of bilateral disease must be carefully evaluated. Extraadrenal pheochromocytoma is rare in MEN2 but does occur, especially in accessory adrenal glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85629\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85629 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86207 \">picture 5</a>) or in extraadrenal chromaffin cells (paragangliomas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

This topic is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pheochromocytoma-in-genetic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pheochromocytoma in genetic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN2A is almost always multiglandular. It has been reported in 10 to 25 percent of patients with MEN2A, depending upon the specific <em>RET</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/1,7,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,26,27</a>]. The hyperparathyroidism in MEN2A is often mild and asymptomatic. In patients who have undergone regular screening, the diagnosis is established by finding high (or inappropriately normal) serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations in the presence of hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The recurrence rate after apparently successful subtotal parathyroidectomy is less than that in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] and is similar to the excellent long-term results seen in patients with nonfamilial primary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>There has been a suggestion that parathyroid disease in MEN2A may somehow be a consequence of the C-cell abnormalities, based upon a low reported incidence of parathyroid disease in patients in whom C-cell hyperplasia was detected early and treated by total thyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In one report, as an example, none of 22 patients who underwent thyroidectomy developed hyperparathyroidism after more than 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Why this might occur and whether the risk is indeed lower after thyroidectomy is not clear. It seems unlikely that hypercalcitoninemia per se is the stimulus for the parathyroid tumors for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperparathyroidism is not associated with MEN2B, FMTC, or sporadic MTC, all of which can be characterized by sustained hypercalcitoninemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <em>RET</em> gene is expressed in MEN2A-associated parathyroid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A particular <em>RET</em> mutation, Cys to Arg at codon 634, may be preferentially found in MEN2 families that have hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/3,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hyperparathyroidism rarely may be the first manifestation of MEN2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>These data imply that the initial stimulus to parathyroid cell proliferation in MEN2A, while often mild, is probably related to expression of the mutant RET protein within parathyroid tissue. It is interesting in this context, although not of direct clinical importance, that calcium suppression testing in normocalcemic patients has suggested that mild abnormalities in parathyroid function may be common in MEN2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1589672\"><span class=\"h3\">Other associated diseases</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h4\">Cutaneous lichen amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CLA, also termed lichen planus amyloidosis (LPA), is a rare skin condition and can occur both sporadically and as a familial disease.

Within MEN2A, there are four variants. The genetic defect in MEN2 involves the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene on chromosome 10. MEN2A and 2B are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with very high penetrance. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MEN2A is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and primary parathyroid hyperplasia. While the lifetime penetrance of MTC is nearly 100 percent, there is much inter- and intrafamily variability in MTC onset and in the other manifestations of MEN2A. (See <a href=\"#H3038677\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MEN2B is characterized by MTC and pheochromocytoma but not hyperparathyroidism. MTC occurs in almost all patients. The tumor develops at an earlier age and is more aggressive than in MEN2A; as a result, early diagnosis and prevention are crucial. The syndrome also includes mucosal neuromas, typically involving the lips and tongue, intestinal ganglioneuromas, and a Marfanoid habitus. Disturbances of colonic function are common, including chronic constipation and megacolon. (See <a href=\"#H3038677\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MEN2 should be suspected in any patient with MTC or pheochromocytoma, particularly when the tumors occur at a young age (&lt;35 years), are multicentric, or when more than one family member is affected. The diagnosis of MEN2 is based upon the presence of the classical clinical features, family history, and genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H5607549\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an index patient with one or two of the classical clinical features, identification of a germline <em>RET</em> mutation or the identification of the clinical features of MEN2 in other first-degree relatives is required to make the diagnosis of MEN2. (See <a href=\"#H1929333\" class=\"local\">'MEN2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern or <em>RET</em> mutation, at least two of the classical clinical features of MEN2A (MTC, pheochromocytoma, primary hyperparathyroidism) are required to make the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of an autosomal dominant familial inheritance pattern or <em>RET</em> mutation, the majority of classical clinical features of MEN2B are required to make a clinical diagnosis of MEN2B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial MTC (FMTC) is characterized by the presence of a <em>RET</em> germline mutation in families with MTC, or an individual with MTC, who do not develop pheochromocytoma or primary hyperparathyroidism. Distinguishing the FMTC variant from classical MEN2A may be difficult in small families, and therefore, rigorous criteria for FMTC should be used in order not to miss a pheochromocytoma. (See <a href=\"#H1929304\" class=\"local\">'Familial medullary thyroid cancer variant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with MEN2 based upon the classical clinical features and family history (typically MTC and a family member with MTC), evaluation should include <em>RET</em> mutation analysis (if not already performed) in order to identify the specific <em>RET</em> mutation to facilitate family screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65295\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65295 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1929209\" class=\"local\">'RET mutation analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MEN2 also require screening for MEN2-associated tumors. In all patients diagnosed with MEN2-related MTC, we measure plasma fractionated metanephrines (as the initial screen for pheochromocytoma in patients with MEN2A or 2B) and serum calcium (to rule out hyperparathyroidism requiring concomitant surgical intervention in patients with MEN2A). For patients with MEN2 who present with pheochromocytoma rather than MTC, we measure serum calcitonin and obtain a neck ultrasound to assess for the presence of MTC. (See <a href=\"#H5607657\" class=\"local\">'Screening for MEN2-associated tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If pheochromocytoma is found, it should be removed prior to thyroidectomy. If the initial testing for coexisting tumors is negative, it is important to evaluate the index patient for pheochromocytoma (MEN2A and 2B) and hyperparathyroidism (MEN2A) yearly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77855 \">table 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a germline <em>RET</em> mutation is identified in an index case, <em>RET</em> mutation analysis should also be performed in first- and second-degree family members. Affected family members require screening for MEN2-associated tumors. (See <a href=\"#H1590765\" class=\"local\">'Genetic screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5797487\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for MEN2-associated tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Early diagnosis by screening of &quot;at-risk&quot; family members in MEN2 kindreds is important because identification of specific <em>RET</em> mutations predicts particular phenotypes (age of onset, aggressiveness of MTC, and presence or absence of other endocrine neoplasms) and, thus, guides surveillance for MEN2-associated tumors and management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58578\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58578 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77855 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71392 \">table 6</a>).
