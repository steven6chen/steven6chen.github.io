A meta-analysis of five trials that included patients with blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma found a significant reduction in the risk of empyema (relative risk [RR] 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.70) and pneumonia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15-0.87) for patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the three trials that included blunt injury mechanisms, two did not evaluate outcomes by injury mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>], and, in the other, the patients who developed infectious complications had sustained penetrating thoracic injures (gunshot, stab wounds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, none of the trials controlled for the effectiveness of chest tube drainage, a factor that may be important in reducing the incidence of infectious complications (eg, empyema, pneumonia) related to hemothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elective thoracic operations </strong>&ndash; Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is administered as a preoperative dose only (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79097 \">table 1</a>). There is no evidence of benefit for continuation of antibiotics for longer than 24 hours. In a randomized trial that included 245 adults undergoing elective thoracic surgery requiring thoracostomy who received preoperative prophylactic antibiotics, patients treated with extended postoperative antibacterial prophylaxis (48 hours) had a comparable rate of surgical site infections compared with patients randomized to placebo (six versus five patients, risk difference -0.93, 95% CI -6.1 to 4.3 percent, p = 0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In total, 13 patients (10.7 percent) receiving postoperative antibiotics and 8 patients (6.5 percent) receiving placebo developed a primary evaluated outcome (ie, surgical site infection, empyema, or pneumonia by postoperative day 28; risk difference -4.3 percent, 95% CI -11.3 to 2.7 percent). The antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis are reviewed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87205 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Thoracic surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H885075\"><span class=\"h2\">Tube selection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20043970\"><span class=\"h3\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest tubes are silicone or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes that have a radiopaque strip with a gap that serves to mark the most proximal drainage hole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79934\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79934 \">picture 1</a>). Chest tubes of silicone (Silastic) are preferred over older latex rubber tubes that had fewer drainage holes, were not well visualized on chest radiographs, produced more pleural inflammation, and may have been associated with latex allergy. Specialty chest tubes (eg, Nightingale, Wayne, Thal-Quick, Fuhrman) are available to evacuate pneumothorax and can be used with or without imaging guidance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57330 \">figure 1</a>). Alternative devices (eg, Blake drain 19 Fr, 24 Fr) can also serve as thoracostomy drains, if necessary. </p><p>Flow rates through a chest tube are related to factors described in Poiseuille's law (liquids) or the Fanning equation (gases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For liquids, these are the radius of the tube (to the fourth power), pressure difference between the ends of the tube, length of the tube, and liquid viscosity. For gases, these are the radius of the tube (to the fifth power), pressure difference between the ends of the tube, length of the tube, and friction factor.</p><p>Chest tubes are available in a range of French (Fr) sizes from 14 to 40 (diameter in <span class=\"nowrap\">French/3</span> = diameter in millimeter). A 24-Fr tube will drain about 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> of air at a suction level of -20 cm water (H<sub>2</sub>O). The rate of drainage is less for liquids and depends on the viscosity, which is higher for blood and lower for a simple transudative effusion. </p><p>Since these tubes can become plugged easily with blood or purulent drainage, a large tube is needed. We prefer a 28-Fr or larger tube to manage hemothorax since it will allow evacuation of gelatinous clot. Due to the minimal viscosity of air, smaller tubes (&le;24 Fr) can be used for persistent air leak. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> below and <a href=\"#H254981857\" class=\"local\">'Hemothorax'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Malignant effusion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Parapneumonic effusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Chest tubes can be straight or angled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70103 \">picture 2</a>). Angled chest tubes are used often in the surgical setting to assure placement in the posterior costophrenic sulcus. </p><p>Chest tubes typically come in two standard lengths, and either length may be appropriate for an adult. The length of a thoracostomy tube is determined by the ability to place all lateral perforations inside the pleural cavity without kinking of the tube. </p><p>Multiple tubes in the same hemithorax are generally indicated when a single tube is not accomplishing its task. Some surgeons place two or more tubes following decortication with the goal of preventing fluid loculations or air collections that will prevent the lung from staying fully expanded and thereby prevent pleural-pleural apposition. However, after an uncomplicated pulmonary resection, studies have shown no value in additional tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bilateral tubes are generally only needed for independent indications. Bilateral chest tubes are painful for the patient, making ambulation and patient care more difficult. </p><p>For patients with a large pneumothorax, a small-bore chest tube can be placed with a Seldinger technique without imaging and causes less pain compared with a large-bore chest tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For patients with a loculated collection, imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography) should be performed during placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management is dictated by the severity of the patient's symptoms and the size of the pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The general principles for selecting patients who require a chest tube are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p>Once the decision has been made to proceed with evacuation of the pneumothorax, the size of the chest tube selected depends upon whether high-volume air leakage (eg, large pneumothorax, mechanical ventilation) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concomitant blood drainage (eg, traumatic pneumothorax, large pleural air-fluid level) are anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of patients with spontaneous or iatrogenic pneumothorax, a small-bore catheter (8 to 14 Fr) is sufficient because these air leaks are due to alveolar-pleural fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at risk for a large air leak due to bronchial-pleural fistulas (eg, on mechanical ventilation, bronchial dehiscence), we prefer a larger-bore tube (24 Fr). The management of bronchopleural fistulas is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopleural fistula in patients on mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For traumatic pneumothorax, the size of the chest tube will depend on what is seen on chest radiograph. If there is an effusion, then we use a 28-Fr chest tube because of the potential need to drain blood as well as air. However, if no effusion is seen, then a small-bore (&le;14 Fr) tube is placed. Occasionally, more than one ipsilateral chest tube is needed, especially in the mechanically ventilated patient. </p><p/><p>When managing a pneumothorax, suction is not initially routinely employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Instead, the chest tube is attached to the drainage system that contains a one-way valve mechanism to allow air and fluid to exit but prevents air or fluid from entering the pleural cavity from the outside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Valved drainage systems may use underwater seal drainage or a unidirectional flutter valve (ie, Heimlich valve). The underwater seal system can be easily converted to suction, while the unidirectional flutter valve allows the patient to be mobile. If the pneumothorax does not resolve with these methods, suction is applied using a high-volume, low-pressure system with pressures of -10 to -20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Air leaks can be semiquantified by the number of air leak chambers that are bubbling, along with noting the timing of the air leak in the respiratory cycle (eg, intermittent one-chamber leak, continuous five-chamber leak). Digital flow meters are available that allow the air leak to be quantified. These appear to provide a slight advantage in decreasing the length of time a chest tube is in place, but the use of digital flow meters has not been widely adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The size of the potential air leak cannot be known before putting in the chest tube, and the tube that is chosen may be too small. Thus, if the pneumothorax does not resolve, the first step is to increase the level of suction, and only if maximal suction fails to resolve the pneumothorax should a second tube be considered. (See <a href=\"#H335594267\" class=\"local\">'Assessing air leak'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254983688\"><span class=\"h3\">Tension pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate decompression. In the absence of hemodynamic compromise, the suspicion for tension pneumothorax should ideally be confirmed on chest radiograph prior to thoracostomy. However, the patient with worsening dyspnea, hypotension, diminished breath sounds on the affected side, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation away from the affected side should be treated without a chest radiograph. If immediately available, a standard thoracostomy tube (24 or 28 Fr) should be placed; otherwise, needle thoracostomy should be performed, followed by chest tube placement as soon as possible. If a chest tube is not immediately available, needle decompression can be a life-saving (albeit temporizing) measure that should be performed in an arresting patient for whom tension pneumothorax is a possibility. (See <a href=\"#H254982395\" class=\"local\">'Tube thoracostomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H254983853\" class=\"local\">'Needle thoracostomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254981857\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemothorax is most commonly a result of closed-chest trauma, but hemothorax can also result from nontraumatic conditions (eg, malignancy, pulmonary infarct, anticoagulation, aneurysm rupture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The goals of tube thoracostomy in acute hemothorax are drainage of fresh blood, measurement of the rate of bleeding, evacuation of any coexisting pneumothorax, and tamponade of the bleeding site by apposition of the pleural surfaces. Large-bore tubes (greater than 28 Fr) are required to achieve these goals. However, as the chest tube size increases above 32 Fr, there is diminished benefit with increasing patient discomfort. A trial evaluating chest tube size in trauma patients found no benefit for larger chest tubes (36 to 40 Fr) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Occasionally, a hemothorax may cause a loculated pneumothorax, which can be treated with multiple smaller-bore catheters or potentially by instilling a lytic agent to break up the septations. However, loculated pneumothorax in trauma patients may require operative intervention to evacuate. Lytic agents should only be used selectively in trauma patients due to the risk of hemorrhage. Treatment of hemothorax is individualized and typically managed in consultation with a thoracic surgery service. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of malignant pleural effusions depends on the patient's symptoms and rate of reaccumulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66725\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66725 \">table 3</a>). A small-bore catheter (8 to 18 Fr) placed under ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) guidance is usually adequate to drain a malignant pleural effusion or perform pleurodesis (depending upon the viscosity of the sclerosant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of malignant pleural effusions&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal-diameter chest tube for malignant effusion drainage or pleurodesis is not known. Smaller-diameter tubes are assumed to be more comfortable, but larger-diameter tubes may provide better drainage. Many observational studies have suggested that smaller chest tubes have similar effectiveness compared with larger chest tubes for malignant effusion. A multicenter trial compared&nbsp;pleurodesis failure rates and pain scores among 100 patients treated using a small (12 Fr) or large (24 Fr) chest tube with 308 patients treated with&nbsp;opiates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pleurodesis failure rates were similar for smaller versus larger tubes&nbsp;at three-month follow-up (30 versus 24 percent). The type of analgesia had no effect on pleurodesis failure rates.&nbsp;Pain scores were lower for patients receiving smaller chest tubes but similar for type&nbsp;of analgesia; however, patients receiving NSAIDs required more rescue analgesia. Complications during chest tube insertion showed a trend to be more frequent with smaller tubes (24 versus 14 percent), but this result was not significant, and the details of insertion were not given, particularly whether or not imaging guidance was used. The small sample size for the tube diameter comparison may have limited the ability to detect a difference in pleurodesis failure rates, if one existed. </p><p>Chronic indwelling catheters (eg, PleurX) are available for outpatient treatment of recurrent malignant effusion. These catheters come in a kit that includes disposable suction bottles and the appropriate tubing and connectors to access the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Parapneumonic effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For parapneumonic effusion that is amenable to drainage with a single catheter, we prefer initial image-guided placement of a small catheter (10 to 14 Fr) with or without intrapleural fibrinolytic agents. We prefer to try a smaller tube size first since this is generally more comfortable for patients, particularly if more than one tube is needed. However, if the fluid appears viscous or loculated on chest CT, a larger tube (16 to 24 Fr) should be used to minimize the risk of occlusion with fibrinous debris. Unsuccessful drainage of an effusion using a small catheter indicates the presence of multiple loculations or very viscous material. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H733687048\"><span class=\"h3\">Empyema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For empyema, the first decision is whether to treat with chest tube drainage or perform surgical decortication. If tube drainage is selected, one needs to take into account the clinical stage of the empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For a stage 1 empyema, a 28-Fr or larger tube will be needed to manage the thick pus, particularly if there is also debris, but will likely result in a successful clinical outcome. For a stage 2 empyema, a chest tube is still warranted but may fail. Failure to achieve drainage with a single tube should prompt thoracic surgery consultation for drainage using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-31</a>]. For a stage 3 empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], chest tube drainage will almost assuredly result in treatment failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Insertion site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest tube insertion site depends upon the indication for tube placement. Fluid collects in the dependent portion of the chest cavity, whereas air collects in the nondependent portion.</p><p>For evacuating pneumothorax, most clinicians insert the chest tube via an incision at the fourth or fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary or midaxillary line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. In males, this corresponds to the nipple line and, in females, to the inframammary crease. When placed at this level, it is important to direct the tube anteriorly because the tube tends to track between the lobes in patients who have complete fissures. If this happens, the tube may become walled off by the lung and cease functioning. For draining a hemopneumothorax, the chest tube is directed posteriorly because the priority is to drain the blood and monitor the blood loss.</p><p>A potentially better site for patients with only a pneumothorax is the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. It requires placement of the tube through the pectoralis muscle. We recommend this approach only for a pneumothorax clearly seen on radiograph imaging using a small (10- to 14-Fr) catheter (eg, Thal-Quick) rather than a standard chest tube placed via the fourth or fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. Placement via the anterior midclavicular approach can be performed at the bedside for most patients. For patients with a simple, uncomplicated pneumothorax, this approach is associated with reduced pain at the insertion site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Chest tube insertion at any site is uncomfortable or even painful for most patients, but in emergency clinical settings the chest tube can readily be inserted under local anesthesia (eg, 1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) with or without an intercostal nerve block. In the elective setting, oral or intravenous sedation can be administered prior to the insertion.</p><p>For draining pleural effusions, the tube can be placed lower in the chest. The technique for using ultrasound to guide the placement of a catheter to drain pleural effusion is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H254982123\" class=\"local\">'Role of ultrasound or other imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254981216\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wet or dry suction-control, closed-drainage systems are typically used, and each is effective. The configuration and function of a typical wet-control, closed-drainage system (ie, Pleur-evac) is detailed in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80960%7ESURG%2F73270\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80960 graphicRef73270 \">figure 2A-B</a>). Other closed-suction systems are available that allow the patient to be mobile.</p><p>Chest tube drainage systems usually incorporate a pressure release valve that rapidly equilibrates the collection chamber pressure with atmospheric pressure without disconnecting the suction tubing. This feature can be used if the patient develops chest pain as a result of too rapid an evacuation of large pneumothoraces or pleural effusions. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Reexpansion pulmonary edema'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20044135\"><span class=\"h3\">Level of suction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical initial level of suction used in the clinical setting is -20 cm of water. Commercial closed-drainage systems typically allow the suction level to be adjusted between 0 and -40 cm of water. </p><p>The level of suction used depends upon the indication. Suggested initial suction levels are given below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For spontaneous air leaks, the least amount of suction (including none [ie, water seal]) needed to maintain full expansion of the lung is appropriate. Anything more may potentiate the leak and can delay pleural healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. We suggest starting on water seal (ie, no suction). If there is incomplete resolution of the pneumothorax, then we start suction at -10 cm of water and increase the amount of suction only as needed, as determined by chest radiograph. There is no evidence to support the routine initial use of suction applied to chest drain systems in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. A persistent air leak, with or without incomplete reexpansion of the pneumothorax on a chest radiograph, is the usual reason for applying (or increasing) suction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the chest tube is placed for fluid drainage, -20 cm of water is a reasonable place to start, and the level of suction should be increased as indicated with the goal of achieving full lung expansion as determined by chest radiograph. For a collapsed lung due to pneumothorax or copious pleural effusion, large differential pressure gradients should be avoided during lung reexpansion to prevent reexpansion pulmonary edema. When placing a chest tube for a large pleural effusion, we suggest no suction initially, which appears to decrease the risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H335595192\" class=\"local\">'Managing initial drainage'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Reexpansion pulmonary edema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following lung resection surgery and initial postoperative suction, whether ongoing suction applied to the chest tube improves or worsens pleural leaks is controversial.

Early studies suggested that suction improved expansion of the lung and prevented retained hemothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, a randomized trial comparing initial suction with no suction following penetrating or blunt chest trauma found no significant advantages for suction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The equipment needed for tube thoracostomy is listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67371 \">table 4</a>). Two techniques are most commonly used to place a chest tube. The standard technique employs blunt dissection to access the pleural space. In contrast, the Seldinger technique uses serial and progressive dilatation over a guidewire. Although some clinicians use a trocar to aid in the insertion of a chest tube, we believe the trocar method should <strong>never</strong> be used, since this technique significantly increases the risk of organ perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254982123\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of ultrasound or other imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound or other imaging modalities (eg, fluoroscopy, computed tomography) can be used to guide chest tube placement. </p><p>Ultrasound can localize a fluid collection and image the lung to help prevent lung laceration during tube placement. For pleural fluid drainage, the proposed site of chest tube insertion can be confirmed by first performing a thoracentesis using ultrasound guidance. If air or fluid is not obtained during diagnostic thoracentesis, the insertion site is reassessed by reviewing the available chest radiographs or computed tomography. Occasionally, fluid may not be able to be aspirated with a small needle due to high viscosity of the pleural fluid.

For example, if the chest tube will be placed in the fifth intercostal space, anesthetize the skin overlying the sixth intercostal space. This allows the creation of a tunnel of subcutaneous tissue through which the chest tube will be placed, which helps to prevent re-entry of air once the chest tube is removed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make a 1- to 2-cm incision in the skin at the site of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> injection parallel to the intercostal space.

Only easily disrupted adhesions should be lysed with the operator's finger because dissection may cause significant bleeding if more organized adhesions are torn. It is very important to understand that lung parenchyma that is adherent to the chest wall can be mistaken for pleural adhesions. Although the visceral pleura has significant structural integrity, once it is violated, the lung parenchyma is easily torn. Sweeping a finger through the lung can lead to significant bleeding and air leak, possibly requiring surgical intervention to repair. If the operator is not expecting significant adhesions but encounters them, the site should be abandoned. If the patient is stable, chest imaging and consultation with thoracic surgery or interventional pulmonary service should be considered. If the patient requires an urgent tube, using a more caudal rib space (one or two ribs) will generally allow a tube to be safely placed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clamp the chest tube at the insertion end with the Kelly clamp. With the aid of the clamp, insert the chest tube through the tract into the pleural space and direct it either apically for a pneumothorax or inferiorly and posteriorly for a pleural effusion.

If the lung has been in a state of significant compression due to a large effusion or pneumothorax, the clinician must be aware of the possible complication of reexpansion pulmonary edema and be prepared to treat it. If a patient starts coughing while fluid is draining from a newly placed chest tube, it is reasonable to clamp the tube for a period of time. Allow the patient's cough to subside before removing more fluid.

This technique is useful for the placement of smaller bore tubes that drain air and nonviscous fluids and is typically performed with the aid of ultrasound or fluoroscopy to confirm the placement and positioning of the wire or catheter within the chest cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57330 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H254982123\" class=\"local\">'Role of ultrasound or other imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>In the setting of a large pneumothorax or large effusion, where radiographic imaging has confirmed that the lung is significantly displaced from the chest wall at the planned entry site, it may be safe to place these tubes without imaging guidance; however, if there is any doubt, imaging guidance or standard tube placement should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H254982123\" class=\"local\">'Role of ultrasound or other imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Standard technique'</a> above.)</p><p>A disadvantage of this technique is the inability to directly assess the presence of adhesions between the lung and pleural surface during tube insertion. If the introducer needle and guidewire are inserted in an area of dense pleural adhesions, the tube may inadvertently pass into the lung parenchyma. However, using ultrasound before and during tube insertion should minimize this potential complication. (See <a href=\"#H254982123\" class=\"local\">'Role of ultrasound or other imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Once the site is prepared and anesthetized and the skin incision performed as described above for the standard technique, we proceed as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57330 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert an introducer needle into the pleural space and confirm that either fluid or air is returned.

This can be either with a standard chest tube, pigtail catheter, or angiocatheter. We perform this on the affected side in the midclavicular line through the second intercostal space with one of any readily available kits. The angiocatheter from the kit is placed first, which allows for immediate decompression. Then, an 8.3-Fr or 14-Fr pigtail catheter can be placed immediately over a wire into the pleural space using a modified Seldinger technique. As an alternative, a standard chest tube can be placed as described for pneumothorax above. (See <a href=\"#H254982395\" class=\"local\">'Tube thoracostomy'</a> above.) </p><p>In our experience, a standard-length 14- or 16-gauge angiocatheter is nearly always successful. The 14- to 16-gauge intravenous <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/catheter</span> is attached to a 5- or 10-mL syringe and is inserted along the superior margin of the third rib in the midclavicular line. In one small comparative study, longer (8-cm) compared with shorter (5-cm) needles were associated with a significant improvement in success rates (83 versus 41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, risk of injury to the underlying lung is increased with a longer needle. Catheter length should be chosen based upon the body habitus of the patient. The needle is withdrawn and the angiocatheter is left open to air. An immediate rush of air out of the chest indicates the presence of a tension pneumothorax, which has now been converted to a large but simple pneumothorax. </p><p>Because these catheters are small-bore thin-walled catheters, they are prone to kinking and they may not completely relieve a tension pneumothorax. They can also be dislodged, leading to reaccumulation of air and recurrent tension pneumothorax. Thus, immediately following needle decompression, a standard thoracostomy tube should be placed, the size of which depends upon the expected pathology.

From an early report, RPE was reported be more likely after drainage of pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]; however, in later publications, RPE has been associated more with drainage of pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Reexpansion pulmonary edema'</a> below.) </p><p>To minimize the likelihood of developing RPE, we recommend that the chest tube be clamped and no additional fluid removed if the patient develops coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, or oxygen desaturation after chest tube placement. Even without symptoms, we limit initial fluid drainage to 1.5 liters by clamping the chest tube and waiting at least one hour before draining additional fluid. Before resuming drainage in either case, we wait until any symptoms have resolved. However, there is no high-quality evidence to support these recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Patients with large effusions with mediastinal shift contralateral to the chest tube may tolerate a larger amount of initial fluid removal because a certain amount of fluid can be removed to return the mediastinum to midline before the lung starts to reinflate. The risk of RPE begins when the lung starts to reinflate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

If a new closed-suction apparatus is immediately available, the new one should be connected and the old one discarded. The chest tube should not be clamped, because doing so in a patient who has an air leak can lead to tension pneumothorax. </p><p>If the chest tube is no longer draining and there is a suspicion that it is full of clot or debris, the tube can be stripped or cleared of obstruction by other maneuvers. These manipulations should only be performed by an experienced clinician, typically the clinician who places and manages the tube. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To strip the tube, hold the chest tube near its insertion site with the nondominant hand, compress the tube between the first and second fingers of the dominant hand, and gently pull toward the drainage system. Because there can be a significant amount of friction between fingers and tube, it is helpful to apply a lubricant (eg, hand sanitizer, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>, or petrolatum) to the tube prior to stripping. One danger of stripping a chest tube is the potential for creating high negative pressure within the pleural cavity.

These include twisting the tube 360 degrees, pulling the tube out 1 to 2 cm, passing a sterile endotracheal tube suction catheter, injecting a small volume of sterile saline with a few drops of povidone-iodine, or attempting to clear with a Fogarty balloon catheter.

If air does not reaccumulate, the tube can be removed.</p><p/><p>In a patient on mechanical ventilation, some maintain that the chest tube placed for pneumothorax should remain in place as long as the patient requires mechanical ventilation, even when no air leak is present. However, there are no studies to guide chest tube management in this setting, and opinion is divided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254982314\"><span class=\"h3\">Criteria: Effusion</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lung is fully expanded.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily fluid output is less than about 100 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span>.

Prior to removing the chest tube, the likelihood of developing respiratory distress due to recurrent pneumothorax should be considered, and the patient should be monitored accordingly after removal. </p><p>Some clinicians remove the chest tube if the lung remains fully expanded on a chest radiograph performed off suction. Other clinicians prefer to clamp the chest tube for four to six hours and confirm that pneumothorax has not recurred prior to removing the tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. <strong>If the tube is clamped, the patient should be closely monitored </strong>for clinical signs of reaccumulation of <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumothorax/effusion</span>. If there is any question whether a leak has completely sealed, it is safer to perform a clamp trial prior to removing the tube. Proponents suggest that a trial of clamping will identify small, intermittent air leaks that would not be detected by monitoring the pleural drainage unit. However, clamping a tube in the setting of potential air leak involves the risk that a tension pneumothorax might develop. <strong>If the patient has any hemodynamic or respiratory difficulty during the clamping trial, the tube should be unclamped immediately</strong>. </p><p>In preparation for removal of a chest tube, it is important to have all supplies in the room and readily available. Some advocate placing petroleum gauze on the chest tube site under a dry sterile dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, this has never been shown to decrease the risk of post-pull pneumothorax. There is also the theoretical risk of delayed wound healing with petroleum gauze at the chest tube incision site.</p><p>While some advocate for pulling the chest tube at end-inspiration, others advocate for end-expiration. A small study comparing these two techniques did not show a difference in post-pull pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Either way, prior to removing the tube, the technique that will be used should be explained to the patient. The patient should rehearse this several times prior to the actual tube removal. To remove the tube, hold the dressing near the chest tube insertion site with the nondominant hand, ask the patient to perform the planned technique, and verbally reinforce it. At the appointed time, remove the chest tube quickly with the dominant hand while placing a dry sterile dressing with or without petroleum gauze. Once the tube has been removed, secure the dressing with tape. Obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate for recurrence of pneumothorax <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reaccumulation of fluid. An additional chest radiograph the next day is not mandatory and should only be ordered if clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morbidity and mortality from chest tube placement are related to the experience and training of the clinician, the indication for placement, and the circumstances under which the tube is placed (ie, elective versus emergent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Death is not common, but between 2003 and 2008, there were 17 fatalities in the United Kingdom directly related to the insertion of the chest tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Excluding recurrent pneumothorax, complications of chest tube placement include malposition, infection (eg, empyema, pneumonia), organ injury (eg, lung, diaphragm, heart, liver or spleen), and pulmonary edema related to reexpansion pulmonary edema (RPE). The incidence of these complications ranges from 1 to 6 percent and is related to diameter of the tube, with small-bore tubes having fewer complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/14,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,57-59</a>]. However, the incidence of blockage is higher with small-bore tubes. In one study of 126 chest tube placements by pulmonologists at a teaching hospital, the majority of complications were related to clotting, kinking, or dislodgement, which was noted in 8 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. More significant complications (eg, pulmonary laceration) occurred in 3 percent of patients. Rare complications, including intercostal artery aneurysm and cardiac compression leading to cardiogenic shock, have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest tube malposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest tube malposition is the most common complication of tube thoracostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. Chest tubes that are malpositioned may represent a form of penetrating trauma and should be managed accordingly. Consultation with a pulmonary or thoracic surgery service should be strongly considered before making any changes to a stable patient with a tube that is malpositioned. As an example, an intraparenchymal chest tube should not be removed until a second functioning chest tube has been placed into the pleural space. The clinician should be prepared to manage bleeding, as well as a potentially immediate massive air leak, when the malpositioned tube is removed. Without a second functioning tube in place, tension pneumothorax could arise very quickly.</p><p>In one study of 77 chest tubes urgently placed in 51 trauma patients, malpositioning was detected in 20 (26 percent) of the chest tubes upon chest computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Nine chest tubes were intrafissural, five were intraparenchymal, and two were subcutaneous. Location (intraparenchymal versus intrafissural) could not be determined for four tubes. Persistent pneumothorax (including two tension pneumothoraces) and hemothorax were associated with 16 of the 20 (80 percent) chest tube malpositions. Only one of the five intraparenchymal chest tubes was diagnosed by chest radiograph, and only four of the nine intrafissural chest tubes were suspected on chest radiograph. Thus, a CT scan should be obtained if a patient's plain film or clinical course (eg, chest tube not draining) is consistent with chest tube malposition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254984443\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonia and empyema complicate the course of chest tube placement in 1 to 3 percent of patients. Increasing duration of chest tube placement and retained hemothorax increases the risk of infection, which is more common in patients sustaining penetrating chest trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/5,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,66</a>]. The early evacuation of retained hemothorax decreases the incidence of empyema, and chest CT is more useful than plain films in making a determination of who should be treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Patients developing RPE typically present soon after chest tube placement with cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, but the clinical presentation can be delayed for up to 24 to 48 hours. Treatment is supportive, and the disease is usually self-limited.

Indications for tube thoracostomy include pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pleural effusion, including malignant effusion, chylous effusion, parapneumonic effusion, and empyema. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with adhesions from infection, previous pleurodesis, or prior pulmonary surgery, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest should be obtained to guide chest tube placement. Blind insertion of a chest tube is dangerous in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <strong>penetrating</strong> thoracic trauma, we recommend administering prophylactic antibiotics prior to chest tube placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients with penetrating trauma have significantly decreased rates of empyema and pneumonia when given antibiotics prior to chest tube placement, as compared with placebo. No consistent reduction in infectious complications has been found in patients with blunt thoracic injury or nontraumatic indications for tube thoracostomy; thus, prophylactic antibiotic treatment in these populations is not necessary. (See <a href=\"#H733687288\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing an elective thoracic operation requiring a chest tube, we suggest administering preoperative prophylactic antibiotics as compared with extended postoperative coverage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H733687288\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of thoracostomy device, including its size, shape, and insertion site, depends upon the indication for placement and the nature of the fluid to be drained. (See <a href=\"#H885075\" class=\"local\">'Tube selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two techniques are most commonly used for tube thoracostomy. Following appropriate preparation and local anesthetic administration, the standard technique uses blunt dissection to access the pleural space, whereas the Seldinger technique uses serial dilatation over a guidewire. A sharp trocar should <strong>not</strong> be used to access the pleural space; mediastinal injury and fatal exsanguination have occurred. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H254986176\" class=\"local\">'Organ injury'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the hemodynamically unstable patient for whom there is a high suspicion for tension pneumothorax, needle thoracostomy may be life-saving when equipment or clinicians trained in tube thoracostomy placement are unavailable. Following needle decompression of the chest, a thoracostomy tube using a standard technique should be placed as soon as possible because needle thoracostomy may not completely relieve the tension pneumothorax and technical issues may lead to recurrent tension pneumothorax (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H254983853\" class=\"local\">'Needle thoracostomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H254983688\" class=\"local\">'Tension pneumothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry and wet suction-control and closed-drainage systems are both effective for draining pleural air and fluid. Unidirectional flutter valves can be used in patients who have small pneumothoraces with minimal or no air leak or nonviscous malignant pleural effusions, allowing the patient to remain ambulatory. The level of suction used depends upon the indication. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H254981216\" class=\"local\">'Drainage system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following thoracotomy tube placement, death is uncommon. The most common complication of thoracostomy tube placement is malposition of the tube. Other complications are rare but include infection (eg, pneumonia, empyema), organ injury, and reexpansion pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reexpansion pulmonary edema is a life-threatening complication that is usually due to the rapid expansion of a large pneumothorax, but it can also follow rapid drainage of large volumes of pleural fluid. To minimize the risk for reexpansion pulmonary edema, we suggest limiting initial drainage to 1.5 liters (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
