Gifted students need to be challenged to maintain interest and high achievement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Those who are not sufficiently challenged may develop maladaptive behaviors, mental health conditions (eg, depression), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> academic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Lack of challenge can inhibit the development of self-confidence that comes from mastering difficult material and can lead to poor study habits, which may be difficult to overcome in higher education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Given the variety of ways in which students can be gifted and the range of domain-specific abilities within a given student, educational interventions and strategies to challenge gifted students must be determined on a case by case basis. The &quot;optimal match&quot; is a curriculum that matches the child's cognitive abilities, maturity, and academic interests and is sufficiently challenging that it requires the child to work to succeed, but not so challenging that he or she becomes discouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Factors to be considered in choosing an educational program include the student's pattern of strengths and weaknesses, the student's social and emotional maturity, the types of programming available through the local school system, the availability of programs outside of the school setting, and family resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The ultimate decision may represent a compromise based on the advantages and disadvantages of the available options.</p><p>There are few high-quality studies evaluating educational interventions or strategies for gifted children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Educational practices that are used for gifted children have influenced general education practices, and in some cases may have been derived from special education. As such, educational practices that are useful for gifted children are useful for a wide range of students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

Specific types of educational interventions or strategies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceleration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enrichment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability grouping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Programs focusing on meta-cognitive skills and self-regulation</p><p/><p>These interventions may overlap (ie, a program can be accelerated and enriched) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The evidence about the relative merits of different types of programming is largely inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in experimental and controlled studies, acceleration and enrichment have been beneficial in increasing academic achievement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/11,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23-25</a>]. The gifted learner typically benefits most from both acceleration and enrichment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753913\"><span class=\"h3\">Acceleration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acceleration is the practice of allowing the gifted student to learn at his or her own pace. It can occur for one or multiple academic areas and with or without advanced grade placement. With accelerated programming, the usual curriculum may be taught at a faster pace or the student may be permitted to skip formal instruction on the material that he or she already knows. The student may be placed in a higher grade for one or several classes, may be allowed to skip a grade, or may be allowed to complete coursework in less time than it takes other students (eg, to complete high school in less than the typical four years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Acceleration assumes that gifted children learn faster than their peers, but that they learn in the same way (ie, that they are qualitatively similar). This question remains open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nevertheless, in experimental and controlled studies, acceleration has been associated with improvement in educational progress (sustained interest and involvement in academic activities with high-levels of academic success) of gifted students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6,23,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23,27,28</a>]. Acceleration also may raise educational standards for non-gifted students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/14,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,29</a>].</p><p>There are concerns that acceleration may affect the student's social adjustment and that the student may fail to participate in extracurricular activities or find a peer group with classmates who are chronologically older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, there is no evidence that acceleration is detrimental to the social or emotional adjustment of gifted students when the acceleration is well planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/10,28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28,30,31</a>].</p><p>Factors to be considered in determining whether acceleration should be undertaken for an individual student include intelligence quotient (IQ), academic skill level (eg, academic ability level should be above the mean of the desired grade level), social and emotional maturity to interact with older peers, and whether the child is receptive to acceleration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Information about the policies regarding acceleration in individual states of the United States is available through the <a href=\"http://www.accelerationinstitute.org/Resources/Policy/By_State/Default.aspx&amp;token=A6Z18Nmc1WCyrq63Z/SfuIFjs/AMZl8YAeMXI1MnN41ng5ho8xyntHl0xb1+80QOLnBRV4dSd8Xukvpys1vs4f5CuFUFTDe0zMr1yjV9bAU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=83538\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Institute for Research and Policy on Acceleration</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753920\"><span class=\"h4\">Grade skipping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Grade skipping (also known as double-promotion) is a broad-based form of acceleration that does not take into account the student's specific pattern of abilities or the possibility that gifted and nongifted students learn in different ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Advanced grade placement without other interventions does not guarantee an appropriate educational experience.</p><p>The major concern with grade-skipping is that it places gifted students with students who are physically more advanced and also may be different socially and emotionally. Grade skipping is often avoided for fear of causing social maladjustment. Research findings about social maladjustment are mixed, but suggest that decisions about grade-skipping should be made on case-by-case basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Grade skipping may be an option for a moderately gifted student who is a rapid learner with a good memory, but should probably be avoided for profoundly gifted students who would need to be placed with children significantly more advanced in age in order to match their intellectual skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753927\"><span class=\"h3\">Enrichment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enrichment is the practice of increasing the depth and breadth of content. Enrichment can occur by providing higher-level texts or exposure to other media that explore the topic in greater depth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> make connections to other disciplines. Enrichment may allow the student to increase his or her knowledge in a subject area, allow the student to participate in special projects related to the course (eg, reports, presentations), or teach the student creative or other critical thinking skills that may or may not be related to the course content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p>Enrichment can be beneficial to various students, not just those who are gifted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, it may not be appropriate for students who are markedly advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Asking profoundly gifted students to complete additional work at a level that does not challenge them intellectually does not enhance growth, teach perseverance, require the development of study skills, or combat boredom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753934\"><span class=\"h3\">Ability grouping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ability grouping refers to using test scores or other measures of achievement to assign students with similar abilities to learning groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Students of similar abilities can be placed in self-contained classrooms for gifted students, grouped together within a classroom (or across grades) for specific subjects, or enrolled in schools designed for gifted students (eg, magnet schools, science and math schools, private schools that require achievement or IQ testing for admission) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>].</p><p>Ability grouping has not been studied sufficiently to draw firm conclusions. In meta-analyses of evaluations of self-contained classes for gifted children, ability grouping without curriculum modifications (eg, enrichment or acceleration) resulted in minimal or no gains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. Simply learning alongside peers of similar ability does not provide the stimulation needed by the gifted child. However, when combined with appropriate curriculum modifications, ability grouping was associated with improved performance on standardized tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Ability grouping within the classroom does not appear to affect the educational outcomes of nongifted students who are not placed in the high-ability group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H184753913\" class=\"local\">'Acceleration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H184753927\" class=\"local\">'Enrichment'</a> above.)</p><p>Ability grouping must be distinguished from &quot;cooperative learning.&quot; Cooperative learning places students into groups without regard to ability. It is commonly used in general education. Cooperative learning may not be effective for gifted students if the peer group is at a different ability level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Gifted students can become bored or domineering when placed alongside less able peers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753941\"><span class=\"h4\">Out-of-school programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some programs for gifted children occur outside of the regular classroom. Programs for gifted students may meet on weekends or during the summer. Such programs are a type of ability grouping because the classes are only open to gifted students, who may qualify through a &quot;talent search&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Acceleration, enrichment, or a combination of both can be used in these out-of-school programs. Out-of-school programs may or may not connect with the student's experience during the academic year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H184753913\" class=\"local\">'Acceleration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H184753927\" class=\"local\">'Enrichment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753948\"><span class=\"h3\">Meta-cognitive skills and self-regulated learning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metacognitive skills and self-regulated learning are additional approaches that may be of value for some gifted students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6,21,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,33-36</a>]. Meta-cognitive skills use prior knowledge, or knowledge from several disciplines, to solve complex and novel problems. Self-regulated learning skills are the skills required by students to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own learning. The student is taught to become aware of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> attitude towards learning (curiosity, persistence, self-confidence), and develop the skills of choosing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own goals, planning the steps needed to reach the goal, and verifying success in executing the plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3506550\"><span class=\"h3\">Social and emotional development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Educational programming for gifted children can address social and emotional development through [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring time to learn with others of similar abilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing opportunities to explore areas of interest with a variety of peers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of mentoring or coaching to cope with the stress, criticism, and the social demands of high achievement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing approaches to help gifted students support one another (eg, group interventions that provide direct instruction in conflict resolution, decision making, and leadership)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753955\"><span class=\"h2\">Special populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753962\"><span class=\"h3\">Profoundly gifted</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Profoundly gifted students may be under-challenged even in a gifted program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/11,21,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21,37</a>]. They may not find their appropriate level of challenge until they reach college. Grade skipping generally should probably be avoided for profoundly gifted students who would need to be placed with significantly older peers in order to match their intellectual skills. (See <a href=\"#H184753920\" class=\"local\">'Grade skipping'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184753969\"><span class=\"h3\">Gifted with learning disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Services for students who are gifted and also have a learning disability (LD) ideally should include a combination of enrichment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acceleration in the academic area of strength and remediation (eg, special education services) for the areas of weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This may result in grade level asynchronies within the student's educational program. (See <a href=\"#H184753913\" class=\"local\">'Acceleration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H184753927\" class=\"local\">'Enrichment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-educational-management#H11284731\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management&quot;, section on 'Quality instruction for LD'</a>.)</p><p>The accommodations and interventions for LD that are available through special education should be made available to the gifted student with LD, but only if the developmental demands in the areas of weakness are appropriate to the student's ability level. As an example, it may not be appropriate to place a gifted student who has LD into a class for students with LD, because the gifted-LD student may perform better than the nongifted-LD students. The gifted-LD student may best be served by providing supports and services in a general education setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-educational-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gifted-LD children may not qualify for special education services if the school does not recognize their area(s) of weakness as a LD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This may occur if the child's level of function in one academic area is within the average range for his or her age or grade, even if it is substantially lower than his or her general cognitive ability.

This section will focus on the provision of anticipatory guidance and support. The role of the primary care provider in identification of giftedness is discussed separately.

The demands of caring for a gifted child can, at times, be similar to those of caring for a child with a disability. The primary care provider can support the family by providing anticipatory guidance to promote a healthy balance for the family as a whole, monitoring the gifted child for specific vulnerabilities, and helping the family find appropriate educational programming for their child.</p><p>The primary care provider's awareness of the special concerns of gifted children and their families can help gifted children to succeed. Like all children, gifted children are more likely to succeed if their needs are understood and addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184754004\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipatory guidance</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184754011\"><span class=\"h3\">For the child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for the primary care provider to help the gifted child to understand how he or she is different from other children and to value those differences. Nonetheless, gifted children should understand that they are expected to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete activities of daily life and respect and follow the household's rules of conduct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have friends and have fun</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform well at school, both in terms of academic function and classroom participation behaviors</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184754018\"><span class=\"h3\">For the family</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Families play a central role in developing the talents of a gifted child; they serve as the child's initial teachers and can nurture the child's curiosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, fostering the abilities of gifted children may require time, energy, and financial resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Families may feel pressured to provide enriched experiences and may feel burdened by the time and financial commitment required. Parenting and living with a gifted child can be challenging, particularly if the child has a coexisting condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The pressures on the gifted child to succeed can be a significant stressor for the family. Siblings of the gifted child may receive less attention from the parents.</p><p>Families may need guidance about how to manage the differences imposed by giftedness, and to normalize their experience of feeling inadequate to the task of raising a gifted child. The parents may not feel prepared to address the child's asynchronous development, internal drive, perfectionism, questioning authority, or atypical social preferences. The primary care provider can provide information and anticipatory guidance to help with these challenges.</p><p>Important aspects of anticipatory guidance for parents and siblings of gifted children include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/10,11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of information about identification practices, educational, and programming options (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification#H708855915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gifted child: Characteristics and identification&quot;, section on 'Identification'</a> and <a href=\"#H184758722\" class=\"local\">'Types of intervention'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demystification of giftedness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assurance that most gifted children have good psychosocial adjustment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification#H559401957\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gifted child: Characteristics and identification&quot;, section on 'Emotional characteristics'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidance about how to manage the differences imposed by giftedness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asynchronous development</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Internal drive (eg, wanting to spend excessive time on areas of interest); the parents can set time limits to help the child balance the area of interest with other important aspects of childhood (eg, having friends and having fun)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perfectionism and its attendant frustration (encourage them to help the child set realistic goals, focus on the process rather than the outcome, and to value the lessons learned from their mistakes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-educational-interventions-and-primary-care-management/abstract/6,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,41</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atypical social preferences (eg, older children, adults); contact with other gifted children of the same age is a major benefit of special programs for gifted children (see <a href=\"#H3506550\" class=\"local\">'Social and emotional development'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More frequent questioning of authority; when the parent's authority is questioned, <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> can respond with something like: &quot;I have to do my job.
