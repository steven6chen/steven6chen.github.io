In the absence of hand washing between autopsies and deliveries, the clinicians could transmit group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (GAS) to laboring women, leading to postpartum infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. During this time, Semmelweis deduced that physicians transmitted infection via their hands to pregnant women during labor and delivery and showed that hand washing could reduce transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A century later, maternal mortality was reduced further with the introduction of antiseptics and penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Invasive group A streptococcal infections reemerged in the mid-1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], including those associated with pregnancy and childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The annual incidence of GAS postpartum infection in the United States is 6 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Globally, puerperal sepsis causes approximately 75,000 maternal deaths per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], with the highest maternal mortality in Asia (11 percent), Africa (9 percent), and Latin America and the Caribbean (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One retrospective review in Israel noted an incidence of 1 postpartum GAS infection per 2837 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Issues related to pregnancy-related group A streptococcal infections will be reviewed here.

Among patients with pregnancy-related GAS, approximately 85 percent of infections occur postpartum and 15 percent occur during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. In one study including 67 patients with pregnancy-related GAS, 84 percent followed vaginal delivery, and the majority occurred within the first four days postpartum (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Most cases of pregnancy-associated GAS infection are community acquired; approximately 15 to 25 percent of GAS postpartum infections are nosocomially acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. Patients with intrapartum or late postpartum infection are more likely to have had upper respiratory tract GAS infection prior to development of intrauterine infection. Contact with young children during pregnancy represents an underappreciated risk factor for maternal GAS acquisition, since pharyngeal GAS colonization rate is higher in children than adults (25 versus 5 percent). Pharyngeal screening for GAS is appropriate for pregnant women with pharyngitis or upper respiratory illness; this is particularly relevant for women who have close contact with young children.</p><p>Maternal mortality is highest when infection develops within four days of delivery. However, one case report described a patient with GAS bacteremia during the third trimester of pregnancy who received prompt and aggressive treatment, survived, and went on to have an uneventful delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Premature rupture of membranes increases the risk for any postpartum infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one study including 161 women, premature rupture of membranes for &gt;12 hours was associated with an infection rate of 13 percent in mothers (chorioamnionitis and endometritis) and an infection rate of 6 percent in newborns. Prophylactic antibiotics reduced the infection rate to 2.6 percent in mothers and 3.8 percent in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2557078\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>Cesarean section is also a risk factor for endometritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cesarean during the second stage of labor (complete cervical dilation) has been associated with an increased risk of endometritis compared with cesarean during the first stage of labor (less than 10 cm cervical dilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is unknown whether women who have a cesarean section are at higher risk of postpartum GAS than women who have a vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558864\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558871\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors related to pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, upper respiratory tract infection precedes hematogenous seeding of the placenta and uterus, suggesting an important tropism of GAS for these tissues during pregnancy.</p><p>An epidemiologic study noted that postpartum women have a 20-fold increase in attack rate for invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infection compared with nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The apparent increase in susceptibility GAS infection among postpartum women could be due to compromised mucosal or cutaneous barriers (eg, an open cervix, vaginal mucosal tears, episiotomy, or cesarean section incision), a transiently more neutral vaginal pH after amniotic fluid release (which could favor growth of the organism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], or suppressed immunity during pregnancy. For example, alternatively activated M2 macrophages predominate in the postpartum uterus and are focused on uterine repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; the relative absence of proinflammatory M1 macrophages in this setting could leave the host vulnerable to bacterial pathogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558877\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunologic polymorphisms play a role in susceptibility to invasive GAS infection in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], though no studies have investigated this relative to postpartum infections specifically. An inherent resistance to GAS infection is suggested by the fact that a much larger proportion of women are colonized with GAS than actually develop infection. Specifically, one study noted that, during the third trimester of pregnancy, 0.03 percent of women had GAS vaginal-rectal colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, GAS postpartum sepsis occurs with a frequency of only 6 cases per 100,000 live births. These findings suggest that some level of innate or acquired mucosal immunity exists in most pregnant and postpartum women or that not all colonizing strains of GAS are capable of causing infection during pregnancy or after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558883\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of pregnancy-related GAS infection may depend on the specific M-type of GAS in the patient's environment. For example, a population-based study conducted from 1995 to 2000 by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that, among postpartum GAS blood isolates, the most common M-types were M28 (21 percent), M1 (14 percent), and types 4, 11, 12, and 13 (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A similar report of 18 cases from Utah demonstrated that severe GAS puerperal infection was solely associated with M-types 1 and 28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, despite the existence of over 150 different M- and <em>emm</em> types, only a handful of GAS strains are associated with invasive GAS infections in pregnant women. The importance of a specific M-type or its associated toxins and virulence factors is yet to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19970222\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among 67 patients with GAS infections occurring during pregnancy or the postpartum period, 15 percent occurred during pregnancy and 85 percent occurred postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Patients with group A streptococcal (GAS) puerperal sepsis typically present with fever, abdominal pain, with or without hypotension, tachycardia, or leukocytosis. Hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis are signs of developing streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and are associated with higher mortality; in one study, TSS occurred in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients generally develop fever of greater than 38.5&deg;C within the first 48 hours postpartum and have fever for greater than 4 hours in duration. Abdominal tenderness is also a prominent feature. These manifestations can be difficult to evaluate since postpartum abdominal pain is common in the absence of infection, and leukocytosis can be significant even in a normal childbirth. Other clinical manifestations are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F97429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97429 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>GAS can cause invasive infections in the form of endometritis, necrotizing fasciitis, or toxic shock syndrome. The involved areas may include the uterus, vagina, and external genitalia as well as other sites. In one study including 430 women with postpartum infection within 30 days of delivery, sites of infection included breast, wound, vagina, urinary tract, respiratory tract, and endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

These patients were more likely to have systemic involvement and some had hematogenous seeding of the extremities. Given the timeframe of infection onset, it is likely that patients in this group acquired GAS in the community.</p><p>Women presented with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis. Diffuse erythema (scarlatina) or erythema associated with extremity pain were highest in this group.

Because postpartum GAS infections are relatively uncommon, physicians often misconstrue the pain of developing infection as typical postpartum discomfort. The widespread use of pain-relieving agents after childbirth can further mask the signs of incubating infection, which can contribute to a delay in diagnosis with catastrophic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Diagnosis is particularly problematic in pregnant women with premature rupture of membranes.</p><p>The occurrence of fever, chills, and abdominal pain in a pregnant or early postpartum woman should prompt consideration of GAS infection. Leukocytosis, hypotension, and tachycardia are signs of developing streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and are associated with higher mortality. A pelvic exam should be performed; vaginal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection at the site of an episiotomy may be detected via direct observation (or with a speculum to visualize the entire vagina and cervix).</p><p>Blood and urine cultures should be performed, and postpartum women should have endometrial aspiration for Gram stain and culture.</p><p>Marked leukocytosis or leukopenia can be seen. A marked bandemia (greater than 10 percent) may be seen even in the absence of a leukocytosis. Hemolysis or hemoconcentration may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-related-group-a-streptococcal-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography may appear normal and should not delay aggressive management; typically, imaging demonstrates an edematous uterus that is larger than expected. GAS does not generally form abscesses or produce gas, whereas postpartum infections caused by <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> or mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">aerobic/anaerobic</span> pathogens are clearly associated with gas in the tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335179687\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of pregnancy-related group A streptococcal infection includes infection due to <em>C. perfringens</em> and <em>Clostridium sordellii</em>.

This approach is based on in vitro susceptibility data and results from animal studies; there are no trials of antibiotic therapy for pregnancy-related group A streptococcal infection in humans.</p><p>The duration of antibiotic therapy should be individualized. Patients with bacteremia should be treated for at least 14 days. In patients with complicating deep-seated infection, length of therapy depends on the clinical course and the adequacy of surgical debridement; therapy is usually continued for 14 days from the last positive culture obtained during surgical debridement.</p><p>In general, antibiotic regimens for empiric treatment for endometritis include activity against GAS if they include a beta-lactam (penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, or cephalosporin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, or carbapenem.
