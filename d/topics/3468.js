Compared with standard hemodialysis, HDF removes more middle-molecular-weight solutes. Some, though not all, studies have suggested that HDF is associated with improved clinical outcomes, providing adequate convection volumes are achieved.</p><p>However, HDF is more complex than standard hemodialysis and places increased demands on the user and outpatient dialysis center. HDF is not available in the United States. In Europe, Japan, and some other countries where HDF is available, most clinicians use a specific type of HDF termed online HDF. In online HDF, the substitution fluid is produced by the dialysis machine, which enables large convection volumes.</p><p>The use of chronic maintenance HDF requires changes in infrastructure in outpatient dialysis units. Decisions to implement such changes are made on a corporate level, although, when HDF is available in a given center, the practicing clinician can decide to perform either HDF or standard hemodialysis in individual patients. Indications for HDF in individual patients have not been identified. The possible beneficial effect of online HDF on survival is consistent in different patient groups (including age, gender, dialysis vintage, absence or presence of residual kidney function, diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews dosing recommendations and clinical outcomes for HDF.</p><p>The technical aspects of HDF, including established guidelines for its implementation, are discussed elsewhere.

The best data are from a meta-analysis of individual data from three published randomized trials and one unpublished trial, comprising approximately 2800 patients, including mortality data of most of the patients previously censored alive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Compared with standard hemodialysis, the risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were reduced in the HDF group (hazard ratios [HRs] 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99 and 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97, respectively). The risk reduction appears to be mainly due to a reduction in cardiac mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Even lower all-cause mortality was observed when the achieved convection volume was 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/session</span> or more (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98). The figure adjusts this minimum dose to body size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109365 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Convection volume is the amount of fluid that is removed from the patient by HDF. This volume includes both excess fluid that the patient has gained since the last HDF session and &quot;replacement fluid,&quot; which is infused during the HDF procedure. In different studies, a variability in convection volumes is often observed. Some have suggested that high convection volumes may be more likely to be achieved in healthier patients who have higher vascular access flow rate, which could explain the apparent survival benefit of HDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, in three randomized trials, the benefit persisted after adjusting for confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Furthermore, in the Dutch Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST), treatment-related parameters (such as blood flow and treatment time), rather than comorbidity, vascular access, age, and body mass index (BMI), were the main determinants of the convection volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Patient characteristics did not differ among the lower, middle, and highest tertiles of convection volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which online HDF may reduce mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, are not known. Suggested mechanisms include improved clearance of middle-molecular-weight molecules, improved hemodynamic stability with fewer periods of cardiac ischemia, and reduced inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/1,12,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,17-19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clearance of middle-molecular-weight molecules and phosphate &ndash;</strong> The removal of middle-molecular-weight solutes, such as beta-2-microglobulin, myoglobin, leptin, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), is better with online HDF when compared with low-flux hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20-22</a>], though, for some solutes, such as beta-2-microglobulin, not when compared with high-flux hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, although improved clearance has been suggested as a mechanism contributing to improved survival of HDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], in one randomized trial, better clearance of beta-2-microglobulin was not related to outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">HDF provided better clearance of phosphate in several crossover studies and one large, randomized, controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23-25</a>]. HDF resulted in lower serum phosphate concentrations and the prescription of fewer phosphate binders in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/3,4,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,27</a>], studies. Hyperphosphatemia and its treatment with phosphate binders have been implicated in increased cardiovascular risk among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H43339841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Hyperphosphatemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemodynamic stability &ndash;</strong> HDF has been associated with better intradialytic hemodynamic stability, which may contribute to improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/3,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,29</a>]. As an example, among 146 patients, treatment with convective techniques (hemofiltration and predilution HDF) resulted in a decreased risk of symptomatic hypotensive intradialytic episodes (for online predilution HDF: odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in another clinical trial in which 380 patients were randomly assigned to postdilution HDF with convection volume 8 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/session</span> or to hemodialysis, there was no difference between groups in hemodynamic stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. We have less confidence in this trial, however, since 37 percent of patients were lost to follow-up. In addition, the convection volumes were lower in this trial than the target threshold that has been associated with improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mechanism by which HDF may improve hemodynamic stability is not known. Possible mechanisms include a cooling effect on the patient and better preservation of left ventricular function induced by HDF compared with hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared with dialysis, HDF is characterized by a lower energy transfer rate that results in a cooling effect that is comparable with hemodialysis with low-temperature dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Dialysis with low-temperature dialysate is associated with improved vascular reactivity and is a commonly used method of treating intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

However, whereas LVM remained stable in patients treated with HDF, it tended to increase in patients treated with hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammation &ndash;</strong> HDF may cause less inflammation compared with standard hemodialysis, as indicated by lower levels of inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/3,4,23,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,23,38</a>]. Chronic inflammation may increase overall mortality, although this has not been conclusively shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

We prescribe a treatment time of four hours, three times weekly, and a minimum blood flow rate of 350 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.

The majority of clinical trials have used postdilution HDF, and postdilution HDF is the most effective modality for middle-molecule clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Thus, for a patient with blood flow of 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> who undergoes HDF for four hours (ie, 240 minutes), the total blood processed is 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> x 240 minutes, or 84 L.</p><p>The effective convection volume is calculated differently for postdilution HDF and for pre-, mid-, and mixed-dilution HDF.</p><p>For postdilution HDF, the effective convection volume is equal to the volume ultrafiltered during the treatment session.</p><p>For pre-, mid-, or mixed-dilution HDF, the effective convection volume is the ultrafiltration volume, as defined above, multiplied by the dilution fraction (DF). The DF is the plasma water concentration of any solute at the dialyzer inlet relative to its concentration leaving the patient. DF is reduced below 1 due to infusion of replacement fluid into the blood upstream of the dialyzer (Qiu). DF is calculated from the plasma water flow leaving the patient (Qpw), divided by plasma water flow at the dialyzer inlet (Qpw + Qiu).

However, central venous catheters have been successfully used for HDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The size of the needle used for puncture of the vascular access helps to determine the blood flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>] and varies greatly between dialysis centers and patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. We generally use a needle size of 14G or 15G.</p><p>We do not use single-needle dialysis systems for HDF, as this method cannot provide adequate convection volumes. In single-needle dialysis, only one needle is inserted into the fistula and utilizes two pumps for the arterial and venous line. During single-needle hemodialysis, effective blood flow rates are approximately half of the rates during double-needle treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], and the blood flow varies, resulting in variations in transmembrane pressure (TMP) and filtration fraction.</p><p>If a blood flow of &ge;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> cannot be achieved, the treatment time should be increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109361 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3398071684\"><span class=\"h2\">Filtration fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The filtration fraction is the convection volume divided by the processed blood volume (or convective flow rate <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> blood flow rate). The filtration fraction is not set as a separate treatment parameter but is adjusted by altering the substitution ratio, the substitution flow rate, or the target substitution volume, depending on the equipment used.</p><p>The filtration fraction is most precisely calculated from the plasma water flow rate or volume rather than the blood flow rate or volume. However, clinicians use the blood flow rate since the blood flow rate is readily available at the bedside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. When the blood flow rate is used to calculate the filtration fraction, hemoconcentration can vary markedly with variations in hematocrit and plasma protein content. In addition, the <strong>actual</strong> blood flow may be lower than the <strong>set</strong> blood flow, resulting in a higher actual filtration fraction as the recorded filtration (or substitution) fraction keeps pace with <strong>set</strong> blood flow.</p><p>At high filtration fractions, more plasma water is extracted from the blood, and convection volume increases. This results in increased hemoconcentration inside the dialyzer. In postdilution HDF, hemoconcentration may result in clotting, altered membrane performance, and increased filter entrance pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These parameters change during the treatment and may be enhanced by changes in net ultrafiltration rate (eg, by individualized ultrafiltration profiles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Hence, the tolerance for a certain filtration fraction may change during the treatment.</p><p>The maximal filtration fraction is limited by an increase in TMP, particularly with postdilution HDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The increased TMP is caused by hemoconcentration, which blocks the dialysis pores. A high TMP causes alarms and interrupts dialysis, which decreases the total dialysis time. The total convection volume is associated with the frequency of TMP alarms during online postdilution HDF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This problem may be mitigated by automated machine configurations that utilize TMP-controlled treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Another approach is the automatic adaptation of the substitution flow rate to changes in blood viscosity, based on TMP assessment and pressure transmitted by the peristaltic blood pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/62,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1285699559\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYZERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A membrane with a high hydraulic permeability (ie, a high-flux dialyzer) is required for HDF. However, specific information on the performance of different dialyzer membranes in postdilution online HDF is scarce. In the multicenter Dutch Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST), dialyzers were used with membrane surface areas between 1.7 and 2.2 m<sup>2</sup>, ultrafiltration coefficients between 56 and 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour/mmHg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> capillary lumen diameters between 185 and 215 microm, and capillary lengths between 225 and 280 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite these differences in dialyzer characteristics, the convection volume was determined by treatment time and blood flow and not the type of membrane and its surface area.</p><p>By contrast, a crossover study that tested four different dialyzers showed that the highest convection volumes and filtration fraction were achieved by the dialyzer membrane with the largest surface area, a high ultrafiltration coefficient, a wide capillary lumen diameter (&ge;200 micrometer), and a capillary length of 200 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

HDF often requires a higher dose of anticoagulant than is commonly used for hemodialysis. We start with the same dose of anticoagulation for HDF as for standard hemodialysis. However, if clotting or high filter entrance pressure occurs, the dose of LMWH is increased by 25 to 50 percent.</p><p>In our experience, the dose of the prescribed anticoagulant, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or LMWH, is approximately 10 to 20 percent higher in patients treated with online postdilution HDF than in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/4,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,73</a>].

The increase in coagulation results from a combination of greater hemoconcentration and shear stress within the dialyzer and possibly removal of anticoagulant medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-intermittent-high-volume-hemodiafiltration/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1117254488\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG DOSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little data are available on drug dosing in online postdilution HDF.

HDF allows increased removal of middle-molecular-weight solutes. (See <a href=\"#H3233335545\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If adequate convection volumes are achieved and compared with standard in-center hemodialysis, maintenance online HDF may reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The mechanisms by which mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, is reduced are not known. (See <a href=\"#H2812731571\" class=\"local\">'All-cause and cardiovascular mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased risks of HDF compared with standard hemodialysis have not been demonstrated. Potential risks include transmission of infection or induction of inflammatory reactions related to the large volume of replacement fluid. The high rate of ultrafiltration may also result in loss of nutritional and other relevant substances and endothelial or blood cell activation during the treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3599044282\" class=\"local\">'Risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prescribed dose of HDF should define both a minimum urea clearance (which is referred to by the formula <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;Kt/V&quot;)</span> and a minimum effective convection volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is the same as for standard hemodialysis, which is 1.2 to 1.4 per session. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis#H794160589\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'The optimal amount of dialysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients selected for treatment with HDF, we suggest targeting an effective convection volume &gt;23 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/treatment</span> rather than lower volumes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Studies suggest that a minimum of 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/session</span> or 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/week</span> convection volume is required to confer the survival benefit of HDF. Lower volumes may have insufficient benefit to justify the increased complexity and cost of HDF. The effective convection volume may be adjusted to body size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109365 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3516873888\" class=\"local\">'Effective convection volume'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adequate convection volume is achieved by prescribing a sufficiently long treatment time and a high blood flow rate. We initially prescribe a treatment time of four hours and a minimum blood flow rate of 350 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. We perform HDF three times weekly. If a blood flow of &ge;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> cannot be achieved, the treatment time should be increased.
