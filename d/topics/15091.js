The histopathologic spectrum of sarcomas is broad, presumably because the embryonic mesenchymal cells from which they originate have the capacity to mature into striated skeletal and smooth muscle, adipose and fibrous tissue, bone, and cartilage.</p><p>Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are thought to originate from immature cells that are destined to form striated skeletal muscle; however, these tumors can arise in locations where skeletal muscle is not typically found (eg, the urinary bladder). </p><p>Undifferentiated sarcomas derive from mesenchyme that cannot be ascribed to a specific tissue lineage. As such, they are now grouped with non-rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and will not be discussed further in this review. </p><p>The treatment of RMS has evolved considerably over the past several decades. Cure rates have risen, largely due to the increasingly intensive, multimodality therapeutic protocols that have been developed by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG). The IRSG has now become the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG), and the designation IRS is no longer used for cooperative group trials.</p><p>This topic review will cover the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, staging, and risk stratification for purposes of treatment selection among patients with RMS. The epidemiology, pathology, molecular pathogenesis, and specific issues related to treatment are discussed elsewhere, as are primary tumors of bone and other soft tissue neoplasms arising in children as well as adults. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting signs and symptoms of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are variable and are influenced by the site of origin, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of distant metastases. In general, the primary lesion has the appearance of a nontender mass, occasionally with overlying skin erythema. A history of antecedent trauma is uncommon, and fever is only rarely present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation by anatomic site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any body part can be affected by RMS. However, the most common primary sites are the head and neck region (35 to 40 percent), the genitourinary tract (25 percent), and the extremities (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The impact of the primary site location on prognosis is illustrated elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76178 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Head and neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head and neck primary RMS can arise in the orbit (25 percent), parameningeal sites (middle ear, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, and infratemporal fossa; 50 percent), or other locations (including the scalp, parotid gland, oral cavity, pharynx, thyroid and parathyroid glands, and neck; 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. RMS involving the head or neck is most commonly of the embryonal subtype and rarely involves regional lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Head and neck RMS arising from sites other than these typically present as a localized, painless enlarging mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Rhabdomyosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Genitourinary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overwhelming majority of genitourinary tract RMS are of the embryonal type, and many are of the botryoid variant. They can arise from the bladder, prostate, or the male or female genital tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Botryoid variant'</a>.)</p><p>Cervical and uterine tumors are more common in older girls. Paratesticular tumors can produce scrotal or inguinal enlargement in prepubertal or postpubertal boys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Extremities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extremity tumors tend to arise in adolescents, and the typical presentation is that of a painful mass or swelling, with or without erythema of the overlying skin. Between 50 and 75 percent of extremity RMS are of the alveolar type, and they are more likely to spread to regional lymph nodes and along fascial planes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less common sites of primary disease include the trunk, chest wall, perineal-perianal region, and biliary tract. Primary RMS of the liver, brain, trachea, heart, breast, and ovary have all been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of locoregional lymph node involvement depends upon the primary disease site. Lymphatic spread is unusual with head and neck primaries, particularly in children under the age of 10. In contrast, nodal involvement is present in up to one-half of patients with extremity lesions and in over one-half of boys over the age of 10 who present with paratesticular primary sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study from the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG), IRS-IV, suggests that the presence of regional nodal metastases negatively impacts the prognosis of patients with otherwise localized alveolar tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], suggesting that more aggressive therapy might be warranted in this subgroup of patients. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stratification scheme for risk-adapted therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Distant metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer than 25 percent of patients have overt distant metastatic disease at diagnosis, and over one-half of these have only a single site of metastatic involvement, typically the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Other sites of distant metastatic involvement include bone marrow (approximately 30 percent), bone (30 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">omentum/ascites</span> (16 percent), and pleura (13 percent); visceral involvement and brain metastases are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Despite the small number of patients who have clinically overt metastases at diagnosis, it is presumed that the majority of patients who present with apparently localized disease have subclinical metastatic disease. This is based on the observation that before the routine use of systemic chemotherapy as a component of primary multimodal therapy, a substantial number of patients developed metastases and died of their disease despite achieving local tumor control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC AND STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The entire team of specialists (including the surgeon and radiation oncologist) who will be involved in the care of the child with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) must have the opportunity to evaluate the patient at the time of initial diagnosis. It is particularly important that the anatomic boundaries of the tumor (which determine the tumor stage, risk stratification, and treatment) be documented <strong>prior</strong> to starting therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible, the initial diagnostic biopsy should be performed at a facility with expertise in the evaluation of the child with a soft tissue or bone sarcoma to ensure that the tissue is processed properly and to allow for the special studies that are essential for accurate diagnosis and histologic classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62670\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62670 \">table 2</a>). Review of the diagnostic material by a pediatric pathologist with special expertise in this area should be strongly considered because of the profound implications of a precise diagnosis on treatment and outcome.</p><p>The classification of a tumor as RMS requires the identification of features of skeletal muscle lineage. Typically, this involves light microscopic identification of rhabdomyoblasts or cross-striations that are characteristic of skeletal muscle. For cases that lack these features, immunohistochemical staining (IHC) or electron microscopy may provide evidence supporting myogenic differentiation.</p><p>Once RMS diagnosis is confirmed or highly suspected by light microscopic or IHC evaluations, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement is performed on all tumors, regardless of the histology. Identification of <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement by FISH or RT-PCR is required to provide a diagnosis of alveolar RMS. This topic is addressed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Histology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Molecular pathogenesis and molecular diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A summary of recommended initial staging studies is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73916 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic imaging of the primary site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial radiologic evaluation should include plain radiographs of the affected area, as well as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the primary site and surrounding structures. Children who have a primary paratesticular tumor should undergo abdominal CT (thin-cut 5 mm sections) to evaluate retroperitoneal nodal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H719050272\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>MRI is increasingly considered the imaging method of choice for certain primary locations, such as head and neck, extremity, parameningeal, and pelvic tumors, because of its multiplanar capacity, ability to attenuate bone artifact, and superior soft tissue contrast. Ultrasonography may provide additional information in patients with pelvic tumors (particularly involving the bladder) because the characteristic water density of urine helps in tumor localization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Metastatic workup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on possible sites of spread, the workup can include chest CT without contrast, bilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and a radionuclide bone scan. Sites that appear abnormal on bone scan should be investigated further with plain radiographs and, if findings are equivocal, MRI. </p><p>However, a retrospective analysis of 1687 patients enrolled in Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG) studies over a 13-year period suggests that 45 percent of patients with newly diagnosed RMS (particularly those with node-negative, noninvasive tumors) may be spared one or more staging procedures, such as CT of chest, staging bone marrows, and bone scans. However, these findings require additional confirmation in prospective studies before they can be widely adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The role of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in the initial staging evaluation, particularly to identify lymphatic or distant metastases that are missed by conventional radiographic imaging methods and in monitoring the response to therapy, is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. The most recent Children's Oncology Group (COG) RMS protocols include serial PET imaging as an optional procedure as an attempt to answer these questions; data are not yet available. Similar definitive data do not exist in adult soft tissue sarcomas as well. In the opinion of the authors, this test, which is known to have higher cost and radiation exposure than standard imaging, should only be used in a clinical trial setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial baseline laboratory studies should include a complete blood count with differential, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, liver function tests, and serum levels of creatinine, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, and calcium. Although uncommon, hypercalcemia can occur in patients with or without bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Baseline coagulation studies should be obtained, while disseminated intravascular coagulation as a presenting manifestation of RMS is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Lumbar puncture is not indicated in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">orbit/eyelid</span> primaries unless there is evidence of meningeal invasion on MRI. Leptomeningeal dissemination can rarely occur in such patients; if present, craniospinal irradiation must be administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H719050272\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph node assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy of <strong>any</strong> enlarged lymph nodes is necessary to confirm local metastatic disease. If this is not feasible or not performed for whatever reason, local control with radiotherapy should include those nodes that are clinically presumed to be involved. </p><p>In the absence of pathologically enlarged nodes, sentinel node biopsy is indicated for all extremity tumors. Furthermore, all boys 10 years of age or older who have a paratesticular RMS should undergo routine ipsilateral nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Role of surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING AND PROGNOSTIC STRATIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to histology and molecular analysis for <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement, there are two classification procedures to appropriately stratify newly diagnosed patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) into risk-based therapy groups: the clinical group (CG) and the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical group</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely used surgicopathologic staging schema is the CG system developed by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG) in 1972 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. Based upon data derived from IRS-I and II on degree of tumor spread at diagnosis and the amount of disease remaining after initial surgery, this system recognizes four disease categories (CG I through IV, Roman numerals) with distinctly different prognoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">TNM system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the CG system is clinically useful for assigning treatment, it does not take into account other important prognostic factors, such as tumor size and primary site, nodal involvement, histology, cytogenetics, and patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. To address some of these concerns, a pretreatment TNM-type staging system was developed and incorporated into the fourth IRSG protocol (IRS-IV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62717 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>This modified TNM system assigns one of four disease stages (from 1 through 4, Arabic numerals) based upon the site and size of the primary lesion, regional nodal involvement, and presence or absence of metastatic disease. Favorable disease sites include the orbit and eyelid, other nonparameningeal head and neck locations, and nonbladder, nonprostate genitourinary tumors (eg, paratesticular tumors), while unfavorable sites include the extremities, bladder and prostate, cranial parameningeal sites, trunk, and retroperitoneum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic stratification scheme for risk-adapted therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TNM and CG staging systems complement each other, and both are used in modern classification schemes to assess prognosis and select treatment for individual patients with RMS. The prognostic stratification schema that was adopted by the IRSG for its current study protocol combines information from the CG and TNM staging systems as well as the histologic variant to stratify patients into distinct prognostic groups with very good, good, or poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. More recently, based upon data indicating that patients who have alveolar tumor histology without one of the two characteristic translocations [t(1;13) and t(2;13)] leading to <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement have similar survival rates to patients with embryonal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], current clinical practice has evolved away from using histology to classify these tumors, and this has been replaced by an assessment of the presence or absence of the characteristic <em>FOX01</em> fusion gene. These prognostic categories are then used as the basis for treatment selection, a process referred to as risk-adapted therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 6</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stratification scheme for risk-adapted therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396642133\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Marc Horowitz, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Fletcher CDM, Chibon F, MErtens F.
