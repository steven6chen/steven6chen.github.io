Rehabilitation of musculoskeletal injuries, with an emphasis on the physical therapy program, is discussed separately.

The evaluation of musculoskeletal trauma and the management of fractures and unstable joints are discussed separately (refer to UpToDate topics on the specific bone or joint in which fracture or dislocation is suspected) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 60 million US youth aged 6 through 18 years participate in organized sports each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Analysis of sports and recreation related injury episodes in the United States has shown an average annual estimate of 8.6 million injury episodes with an age-adjusted rate of 34.1 per 1000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Overall, injury rates are higher among males and children between the ages of 5 to 14 years. Approximately 50 percent of injuries require medical attention. Injuries to the lower extremities are most common (42 percent) followed the upper extremities (30 percent), and head and neck (16 percent).</p><p>According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases report there are more than 2.6 million children younger than 19 years of age who were treated in emergency departments for musculoskeletal injuries due to sport participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Musculoskeletal injuries are also the most common reason for injury-related visits to primary care physicians. Sprains and strains, growth plate injuries, and repetitive motion injuries account for the majority of injuries. </p><p>Although most children and adolescents with musculoskeletal complaints can be managed by primary care providers with appropriate training, such children often are referred to specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

During the inflammatory phase, local and systemic responses to injury lead to altered vascular permeability about the injury site. Homeostasis of fluid balance is disrupted, resulting in swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Capillaries dilate and become more permeable, resulting in transmission of blood to the extravascular space and concentration of local inflammatory mediators. Plasma protein and fluid are deposited in the interstitium, and development of small pockets of fluid in tissues occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>If these processes and their sequelae are improperly managed, healing may be delayed, and chronic adverse tissue changes (eg, fluid stasis, aberrant deposition of fibrinogen, soft-tissue thickening, formation of adhesions) may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Chronic changes may be associated with persistent pain, decreased function, decreased range of motion, decreased power, and increased risk of reinjury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Reparative phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">reparative/fibroblastic</span> phase of healing takes place from approximately three days through three weeks after injury. During the reparative phase, collagen deposition and tissue healing occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Maturation phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">maturation/remodeling</span> phase takes place from approximately three weeks through two years after injury. During the maturation phase, new collagen and bone matrix fibers that were deposited during the reparative phase increase their strength and organization. The application of excessive force during the maturation phase will disrupt the immature tissue. On the other hand, if insufficient force is applied, the tissue will not organize along lines of stress and will fail during the application of strong force as the athlete returns to sports activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">REHABILITATION PROGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phases of rehabilitation correspond to the phases of healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each phase of rehabilitation has associated goals, although there is some overlap, particularly as the athlete makes the transition from the reparative to the maturation phase. The ultimate goal is to return the athlete to sports competition in a timely fashion while minimizing the risks of reinjury or a second injury. The rehabilitation program is discussed in detail separately.

Ice application should begin immediately postinjury. Ice packs should be applied for 20 to 30 minutes (either continuously or in 10-minute sessions with 10 minute breaks between sessions) directly on the skin. Three to four times per day is considered sufficient, but cold therapy can be performed every hour; the more frequent the application, the greater the chance of effectively reducing the inflammatory process.</p><p>The optimum temperature range for reduction of cell metabolism without causing cell damage is 10 to 15&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Areas particularly vulnerable to ice injury include the peroneal nerve at fibular neck and the ulnar nerve at elbow.

There are other factors that affect the relationship between skin temperature and nerve conduction velocity, such as the depth of the nerve, the amount of surrounding subcutaneous tissue, age, range of temperature variation, and possibly the type of modality used to alter skin temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/musculoskeletal-injury-in-children-and-skeletally-immature-adolescents-overview-of-treatment-principles-for-nonoperative-injuries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Each phase of rehabilitation has associated goals, although there is some overlap.
