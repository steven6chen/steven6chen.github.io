Once renal replacement therapy is initiated, the range of the expected remaining lifespan in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) report was approximately eight years (varies with race) for dialysis patients 40 to 44 years of age and approximately 4.5 years for those 60 to 64 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These values in older patients are only slightly better than those in patients with lung cancer and are much worse than the general population (which is 30 to 40 years for those aged 40 to 44 years and 17 to 22 years for individuals aged 60 to 64 years). Despite this, some evidence suggests that mortality rates among incident dialysis patients have decreased over the last few years, suggesting that improvements in therapy may provide beneficial results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>It is well established that inadequate dialysis is a contributor to lower overall survival. This has important implications since more intensive dialysis, particularly above a certain threshold value, may improve survival, possibly as with nocturnal hemodialysis.</p><p>Additional factors associated with the dialysis procedure may also correlate with decreased survival. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis vintage is associated with an enhanced risk of death, with each additional year of dialysis treatment associated with an increase in the risk of death of approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium levels &lt;4.0 or &gt;5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> are associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients compared with serum levels between 4.6 and 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, some, but not all, studies have reported that mortality may be lower among dialysis patients being treated in not-for-profit facilities compared with those undergoing dialysis in for-profit facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study in the United States, a high nephrologist caseload was associated with a higher patient mortality rate compared with that of patients under the care of nephrologists with lower caseloads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the dialysis facility may affect mortality. One study of 385,074 dialysis patients suggested that a higher mortality was observed among patients dialyzed at facilities with &lt;15 stations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>A review of those factors associated with mortality among dialysis patients, with an emphasis upon those characteristics related to dialysis itself, will be presented here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF DEATH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before discussing the different factors underlying mortality in dialysis patients, it is helpful to briefly review the major causes of death in this patient population: cardiovascular disease, infection, and withdrawal from dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular disease accounts for approximately 50 percent of deaths. While a decline in cardiovascular deaths has occurred in the general population, a similar trend has not been observed in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This discrepancy is in part due to the demographics of patients about to be started on dialysis: Approximately 40 percent are diabetic; the average age is now approximately 60 years, and approximately 20 percent are &gt;75 years of age; and many patients have underlying cardiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors not related to dialysis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections, which are the second most common cause of death, are usually due to common organisms (such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) and are frequently related to the hemodialysis vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

As noted in the 2007 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Annual Report, diabetes mellitus was the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in those initiating hemodialysis (44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Extended survival at 10 years appears to be less likely for diabetic than nondiabetic patients (4 versus 11 to 14 percent).</p><p>Heart disease is also very common in the dialysis population. Approximately 80 percent of all patients enrolled in the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study were noted to have some form of heart disease, with nearly 40 percent having ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It has also been estimated that only 27 percent of patients about to enter a dialysis regimen have a normal echocardiogram, while 19 percent already have severe left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, as many as 75 percent of the total ESRD population have at least a 50 percent narrowing of at least one coronary artery. Even patients with mild to moderate chronic renal failure are at markedly increased cardiovascular risk, with chronic renal disease alone considered a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and epidemiology of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to antecedent coronary artery disease, additional factors common in dialysis patients may promote the development of coronary disease and enhanced cardiovascular mortality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension, which is present in approximately 80 percent of patients at the onset of dialysis and, with effective fluid control, approximately 25 to 30 percent at the end of the first year.

In an extensive analysis of Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) data, 17 comorbid conditions accounted for nearly all of the total variance that predicted survival among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five-year survival among dialysis patients is best with chronic glomerular diseases and polycystic kidney disease (PKD), intermediate with hypertension-induced renal disease, and worst with diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>]; five-year survival of the patient with diabetic nephropathy is only 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival declines with increasing age, with patients &lt;45 years of age doing best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1,15,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,28,29</a>]. Older patients with renal vascular disease appear to have the worst prognosis, with such patients having 5- and 10-year survival rates of only approximately 15 and 5 percent, respectively. In one prospective study from Canada, these older patients were frequently not offered dialysis as possible therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Country</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival among dialysis patients has been substantially lower in the United States than in Europe and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/15,19,29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19,29,32,33</a>]. Some evidence suggests that this is due in part to general differences in mortality (particularly that due to cardiovascular disease) among the general population in various countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In one European study that adjusted for age, gender, and diabetes, for example, approximately 25 percent of the difference in mortality among dialysis patients between the northern and southern areas of Europe could be attributed to differences in mortality in the general population of these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Differences in mortality in various countries and geographic regions therefore cannot be entirely explained by differences among patients that are unrelated to dialysis itself. These include variations among comorbid conditions (with increased incidence of diabetes, psychiatric diseases, and cardiovascular disease [heart failure and peripheral vascular disease] in the United States); patient age (which tends to be higher in the United States); racial or genetic differences; other demographic factors; and differences in transplantation rate (low rate in Japan) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/19,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,33</a>].</p><p>Other factors that may contribute to the differences in survival include variations in underlying renal disease (such as increased incidence of immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy in Japan) and differences in thresholds for accepting patients for dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A decline in the relative mortality rates in the United States may reflect the consistent widespread improvement in the overall quality of the national dialysis prescription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Improved survival with more intensive dialysis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a group, African Americans and Asian Americans have a lower mortality rate than whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36-38</a>]. In one study, the survival rates of black, white, and other races at five years were 35, 25, and 32 percent, respectively. Similar relative results were observed in a single-center study, which reported 47 and 36 percent survival rates at five years for black and white patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In initial studies, this survival advantage appeared to persist after adjustment for patient characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40</a>].</p><p>However, in subsequent studies, the survival advantage was markedly attenuated or lost in multivariate analyses that adjusted for other patient variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of outcomes of 1,330,007 patients identified in the USRDS, although the survival of black patients as a group was better compared with white patients, this advantage was modified by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Whereas a survival advantage persisted for black patients &gt;50 years of age, black patients &lt;50 years of age had higher mortality compared with white counterparts, particularly when transplantation was factored in as a competing risk.</p><p>The underlying reasons for increased survival among older blacks are unclear. One possibility is that mortality among blacks with predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher than among whites with predialysis kidney disease, resulting in the selection of relatively &quot;healthier&quot; patients who eventually require dialysis. This, in turn, would result in an apparent survival advantage among blacks with ESRD. Support for this hypothesis was provided by a study of participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), in which a higher risk for death in the early stages of CKD was observed among blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another possibility is that black dialysis patients may have a relatively greater use of activated vitamin D therapy, a modality indirectly linked with improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychosocial factors also appear to significantly affect mortality, independent of the presence of other comorbid conditions. Increased levels of social support, enhanced behavioral compliance, and positive perceptions of the effects of illness are all associated with a decreased risk of dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Their effect on mortality appears to be equivalent to those of medical risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychiatric illness in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Location of residence may alter survival. Residence in areas with higher median household income has been associated with improved survival and, among blacks, residence in highly segregated areas with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is greater medical risk and increased mortality in undernourished patients, particularly those with hypoalbuminemia. Although these observations have primarily been made in patients on maintenance hemodialysis and are related to the dialysis dose (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Malnutrition'</a> below), the presence of malnutrition prior to the initiation of dialysis is strongly predictive of increased mortality with the onset of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617445752\"><span class=\"h2\">Salt intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A post-hoc analysis of the HEMO Study including 1770 hemodialysis patients has suggested that higher reported dietary sodium intake and the ratio of sodium to calorie or potassium intake are associated with increased all-cause mortality and a slightly increased ultrafiltration requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Reported sodium intake was not associated with predialysis systolic blood pressure. Prescribed sodium restriction was not associated with mortality, systolic blood pressure, or ultrafiltration requirement in this study. This study is somewhat limited by the use of dietary recall, which may have underestimated both sodium and calorie intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14176514\"><span class=\"h2\">Residual renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residual renal function is associated with improved survival of dialysis patients.

Urea kinetic modeling became widely applied after the results of the National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) were published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. The NCDS found that a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> urea &gt;0.9 with thrice weekly treatment provided an &quot;adequate&quot; dialysis prescription in that the patient failure rate of 13 percent was substantially below that in patients with a lower <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.

However, this goal was quite arbitrary since no attempt was made in the NCDS to determine whether a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> might be associated with further clinical, biochemical, or rehabilitative improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Improved survival with more intensive dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent observational data suggested that a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> was beneficial. Excellent survival rates have been reported in Tassin, France <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V</span> &gt;1.6) and Minnesota, United States <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V</span> &gt;1.3), where patients, even those in high-risk groups, were more intensively dialyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/29,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,82</a>]. Urea kinetic modeling was utilized, but attention was paid to all the details involved in delivering a more optimal dialysis prescription. This improvement in survival occurred despite a striking increase in comorbidity, which itself would have decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Similar findings were reported in a retrospective analysis of 13,473 patients, in which patient outcome was compared with dialysis intensity. Patient survival was significantly reduced at urea reduction ratios (URRs) &lt;60 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/V</span> &lt;1.20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. A definition of the URR can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of observational studies were compatible with the hypothesis that more intensive dialysis leads to improved survival:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, increasing the mean <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> from 0.82 (pre-1988) to 1.33 led to a reduction in the gross mortality rate from 22.8 down to 9.1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This was associated with increases in protein catabolic rate from 0.83 to 1.0 (an index of protein intake (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-intake-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein intake in maintenance hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>)) and in plasma albumin concentration from 3.5 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (35 to 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. Thus, enhanced nutrition probably contributed to the improvement in survival (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Malnutrition'</a> below). However, increasing the degree of dialysis was associated with the use of biocompatible hemodialysis membranes; it is therefore possible that the observed benefits were due at least in part to avoidance of bioincompatible membranes. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialysis membranes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, increasing the mean <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> from 1.18 (pre-1989) to 1.46 (and the URR from 61 to 70 percent) led to a reduction in the gross mortality rate from 22.5 down to 18.1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

Since these values reflect increased urea clearance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an extremely low body volume (which may represent poor nutrition), the increased death rate may have been due to the effects of marked malnutrition.</p><p>Support for this hypothesis comes from a study that evaluated the correlation between mortality, dialysis dose, and body volume in over 3000 dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Consistent with previous reports, patients with a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or URR value in the highest (fifth) quintile had an increased RR of death (19 percent greater than those in the third quintile). However, a higher Kt alone was not associated with an increased RR of death, as there was a 2 percent decrease in mortality risk per liter increase in clearance.</p><p>These observations, in combination with the finding that patients in the fifth quintile suffered from more severe protein-calorie malnutrition, suggest that the increased mortality associated with very high <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or URR values may reflect poor nutrition. Such findings support the use of alternative measures of dialysis adequacy, such as the Kt alone.

Statistical analysis of the previous studies, as well as others by Gotch et al, suggested that faulty methodology may have supported the conclusion that increasing dialysis equals increasing survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

The high-dose goal was an equilibrated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.45, which is the same as a ratio of 75 percent or a single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.65. The primary outcome was death from any cause, while the main secondary outcomes were the rate of all hospitalizations (but excluding those related to access) and the composite outcomes of the first hospitalization for a cardiac problem or death from any cause, the first hospitalization for an infectious cause or death, and the first decline of &gt;15 percent of the serum albumin from baseline value or death.</p><p>The following results concerning dialysis dose were reported at a mean follow-up of 4.5 years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impressive separation was obtained.

As an example, based upon data from 2858 United States dialysis facilities from 1999 to 2002, those centers in the lowest quintile for the percentage of patients with higher than recommended URRs had 22 percent higher mortality rates than those in the highest quintile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients treated with peritoneal dialysis, a similar correlation between the degree of solute clearance (measured weekly either by <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or the creatinine clearance) and survival was also postulated to exist. This hypothesis was supported by the results of a prospective, cohort, multicenter study in Canada and the United States (CANUSA) that evaluated the relationship of the adequacy of dialysis and nutritional status to mortality, morbidity, and technique failure.</p><p>However, survival in this study was related to residual renal function (which changed over time) and <strong>not</strong> to peritoneal clearance alone (which did not change). Confirmation that an increase in peritoneal clearance alone (beyond a minimum threshold value) is not a principle factor underlying survival was provided by the Adequacy of Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico (ADEMEX) trial.

High-flux membranes are better able to remove such substances, compared with that observed with low-flux membranes. Whether survival differs upon exposure to high- and low-flux membranes was also evaluated in the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study, in which nearly 2000 patients were randomly assigned to a standard or high dose of dialysis <strong>and</strong> a low- or high-flux dialyzer (based on clearance of beta-2-microglobulin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The primary outcome was death from any cause, while the main secondary outcomes were the rate of all hospitalizations (but excluding those related to access) and the composite outcomes of the first hospitalization for a cardiac problem or death from any cause, the first hospitalization for an infectious cause or death, and the first decline of &gt;15 percent of the serum albumin from baseline value or death.

Chronic fluid overload is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/102-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-106</a>].</p><p>A large observational study showed significant associations between both baseline and one-year cumulative fluid overload and increased mortality among outpatient incident hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Patients were stratified by systolic blood pressure (&lt;130, 130 to 160, and &gt;160 mmHg), and bioimpedance spectroscopy was used to assess fluid status. Fluid overload was defined as &ge;15 percent fluid excess for men and &ge;13 percent fluid excess for women, and the first measurement was obtained within three months of starting hemodialysis. Both fluid overload at initiation and one-year cumulative fluid overload predicted increased mortality across all blood pressure groups. Cumulative fluid overload had the larger effect on mortality (for patients with systolic blood pressure &lt;130 mmHg, hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; for patients with systolic blood pressure 130 to 160 mmHg, HR 1.51; for patients with systolic BP &gt;160 mmHg, HR 1.62). The effect of fluid overload was similar in all groups as stratified by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities including diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>Although this study does not suggest a causal relationship between fluid overload and mortality (cause-specific mortality was not determined), this study and others support a detrimental effect of fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p>Adequate fluid removal depends upon the technical ability to remove excess fluid, the patient's tolerance to the fluid removal rate, and the patient's adherence to fluid-intake restrictions. Shorter dialysis necessitates more rapid fluid removal, which is more likely to induce episodes of hypotension that are treated with fluid administration. The net effect is that dry weight is never achieved, leading to persistent volume expansion, hypertension, and possible deterioration in left ventricular function. These complications may contribute to the high cardiac mortality in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dry weight has been defined as not merely the absence of edema but the minimal body sodium content and volume of body water that can be tolerated without inducing hypotension. Gradual fluid removal with longer dialysis permits a greater degree of total fluid loss and more likely attainment of dry weight. As an example, slow dialysis, such as with nocturnal hemodialysis, commonly results in normotensive patients who do not require the use of antihypertensive medications. The ability to discontinue drug therapy may be an important component of this regimen since it further minimizes the risk of hypotension as the excess fluid is removed.</p><p>The ability to remove adequate fluid also depends upon the ability of the patient to adhere to fluid-intake restrictions. Some data suggest that psychologic interventions may improve the ability to adhere to such restrictions, although the quality of the medical literature is generally poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433970018\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate ultrafiltration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate total body fluid removal may increase the overall risk of death.

As an example, a plasma albumin concentration &lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> is the single laboratory finding most closely associated with an increased probability of death. The increase in risk is dose dependent, rising modestly at a plasma albumin concentration of 3.5 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (35 to 39 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> but being much greater at values &lt;3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70749 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/83,116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,116,117</a>].</p><p>These observations have primarily been made in patients on maintenance hemodialysis and may overestimate the effect of hypoalbuminemia since some measurements taken in the weeks to months before death were included. However, a similar relationship between hypoalbuminemia and increased mortality has been demonstrated with peritoneal dialysis and, although less pronounced than in the figure, with plasma albumin concentrations measured within six weeks of starting dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60944 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-status-and-protein-intake-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional status and protein intake in peritoneal dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of malnutrition prior to the initiation of dialysis is also strongly predictive of increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Despite this, the presence of associated conditions, particularly comorbid conditions, significantly contributes to mortality, independent of nutritional status. In one study, for example, the outcomes of a total of 153 consecutive peritoneal dialysis patients were analyzed based upon the presence or absence of malnutrition, with or without comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. The combined presence of malnutrition plus a comorbid condition was associated with a high mortality, while there is a trend with malnutrition alone for an increase in mortality.</p><p>Conversely, measures of good nutritional status, such as high BMI in combination with normal or high muscle mass, are associated with increased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>]. As an example, in a study of incident peritoneal dialysis patients, the best survival was observed in those with high BMI and normal or high muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p>As with hypoalbuminemia, a similar incidence of undernutrition has been noted with the use of creatinine production to assess lean body mass in stable patients on maintenance dialysis. In one study, estimated lean body mass was below normal in 47 and 66 percent of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. There was a significant correlation between lean body mass and the plasma albumin concentration in the group as a whole; however, there was substantial variability in individual patients.</p><p>Another marker of malnutrition, a low ratio of body weight for height, also predicts mortality in hemodialysis patients. In an analysis of data from nearly 13,000 patients, there was a highly significant inverse relationship between mortality rates and the ratio of body weight for height among those with ratios below the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>The association between markers of malnutrition and reduced patient survival does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Nevertheless, it constitutes the rationale for attempting to improve nutrition via diet and more intensive dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and treatment of malnutrition in maintenance hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The meaning of a low plasma albumin concentration may also differ among hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients due in part to variations in volume status. The serum albumin among hemodialysis patients is often measured predialysis, a time when volume expansion is maximal; by comparison, the concentration of albumin in the peritoneal dialysis population should not vary acutely. Differences in mortality among these two modalities that appear to correlate with albumin levels may therefore instead be due to variations in intravascular volume.</p><p>Although poor nutrition is a common cause of hypoalbuminemia in dialysis patients, a number of chronic inflammatory conditions can also reduce the serum albumin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. This effect appears to be mediated by cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which suppress hepatic albumin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Thus, the presence of an untreated, underlying inflammatory process may contribute to the decreased survival observed among chronic hemodialysis patients with hypoalbuminemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammation in renal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike the general population, some, but not all, studies have shown that being overweight (perhaps a surrogate for &quot;overnutrition&quot;) may enhance survival among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/122,127-133\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,127-133</a>]. In one study of over 1300 hemodialysis patients, every one-unit increase in the BMI was associated with a reduction of 30 percent in the relative risk (RR) of dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. This result may be confounded in part by race and gender since African-American females have the highest BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p>The apparent survival benefit conferred by higher body weight may be limited to older adults (&gt;65 years of age).

Among 984 patients &lt;65 years of age, the age-standardized mortality rate was 1.7 times higher for obese patients compared with those with a normal BMI. By contrast, among 765 patients &gt;65 years of age, there was no difference in mortality between obese individuals and those with normal BMIs.</p><p>In addition, increasing height itself may contribute to mortality.

Prominent examples include attaining and maintaining target levels for either hemodialysis dose or hemoglobin concentration. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Adequacy of dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p>Practically all studies that have examined the effect upon survival of achieving clinical performance goals have evaluated benefits due to a single measure of clinical care. There is evidence that achieving multiple clinical targets may be associated with superior survival outcomes versus that observed with attaining fewer clinical targets or only one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/157-162\" class=\"abstract_t\">157-162</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among nearly 200,000 patients, the risk of death during the first year of hemodialysis correlated with having met zero, one, two, or three of the following guideline goals at initiation of hemodialysis: use of an arteriovenous fistula or graft at initiation, hemoglobin level &ge;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> and goal albumin level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>]. Compared with those who met no goal, the risk of death was significantly lower among those who met one (0.81, 0.80-0.83), two (0.53, 0.41-0.56), or three goals (0.34, 0.30-0.39). A lower mortality rate was also observed in those who met each individual goal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a 12-month follow-up period in a retrospective study of 15,287 hemodialysis patients, death or hospitalization were compared with achieving target levels for hemoglobin (&ge;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> serum albumin levels (3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> by bromocresol purple laboratory method), use of a fistula for vascular access, and a single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> urea of &ge;1.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. Seven, 24, 39, 24, and 6 percent of patients met four, three, two, one, and zero targets, respectively. There was a significantly increased risk of death and hospitalization among those in whom targets were not met, which increased with each specific target that was not achieved. Compared with meeting all four targets:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] for death were 1.9 (95% CI 1.4-2.6), 2.6 (95% CI 1.9-3.5), 3.5 (95% CI 2.6-4.7), and 4.6 (95% CI 3.3-6.4) for those who met three, two, one, and zero targets, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adjusted HRs for hospitalization were 1.1 (95% CI 0.98-1.3), 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5), 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7), and 1.6 (95% CI 1.4-1.9), respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of 13,792 incident hemodialysis patients evaluated the correlation between survival and achieving Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines for single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> hematocrit, serum albumin, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. Compared with not achieving any one target, the adjusted HRs for mortality were 0.11 (95% CI 0.06-0.19), 0.19 (95% CI 0.15-0.25), 0.30 (95% CI 0.24-0.37), 0.39 (95% CI 0.31-0.49), 0.52 (95% CI 0.42-0.65), and 0.74 (95% CI 0.49-0.93) for those who met six, five, four, three, two, and one targets, respectively. By comparison, an increased mortality was associated with achieving the blood pressure goal (predialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mmHg; 1.90, 95% CI 1.73-2.10).</p><p/><p>These studies are limited in part because of their design, underreporting of comorbid conditions, and unknown incidence of disease severity. However, these results are generally consistent with other, primarily observational studies showing increased risk of death and hospitalization with decreased dialysis dose or hemoglobin levels, low serum albumin concentration, abnormal mineral metabolism, and hemodialysis with a vascular access other than an arteriovenous fistula. This suggests that quality improvement measures should be implemented to increase the number of those who meet multiple performance measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODIALYSIS VERSUS PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data described above were almost entirely from patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis. Survival of hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis patients is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With peritoneal dialysis, there is increasing evidence that increased survival is associated with centers that are relatively more experienced with peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/163-165\" class=\"abstract_t\">163-165</a>]. In one observational study of outcomes in large dialysis organizations, an increased mortality risk was observed in patients being treated in organizations with the lowest rates of peritoneal dialysis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">HOME HEMODIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home hemodialysis is generally associated with good survival rates. Improved survival had been thought to be due to selection bias since fewer older and sicker patients are treated with home hemodialysis. However, adjustments for age, diagnosis, comorbidity, and gender in large dialysis databases did not alter the decreased risk of death among home hemodialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF HEMODIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although undergoing intense study, no significant conclusions can be drawn concerning the effect on survival of nocturnal hemodialysis or short daily hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> as a measure of urea kinetic modeling quantifies the delivery of dialysis and verifies the dialysis prescription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/83-86,91,166,167\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-86,91,166,167</a>]. Current recommendations are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>). Increasing dialysis time is the most certain way to increase the dialysis prescription, but a modest benefit can be obtained with more efficient membranes and higher blood flow rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to appreciate, however, that there may be a significant difference between the dialysis prescription and the amount of dialysis actually delivered to the patient. In particular, problems with cardiovascular and access recirculation can substantially reduce dialysis delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribed-versus-delivered-dialysis-importance-of-dialysis-time\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribed versus delivered dialysis: Importance of dialysis time&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are similar issues among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Minimal weekly total target clearance values in terms of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> and creatinine clearance have been published over the last several years by United States and international societies. There is a general consensus that some previously recommended target weekly dialysis doses are inconsistent and probably unattainable for many patients, particularly low-average and low transporters. The net effect is an unnecessary increase in the number of patients transferred to hemodialysis because of perceived inadequate dialysis with peritoneal dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An optimal dialysis prescription, whether for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, also must take into account other factors, such as the patient's symptoms, mineral metabolism status, nutritional status (as estimated in part from the plasma albumin concentration and protein catabolic rate), and degree of rehabilitation toward a fully active life (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-intake-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein intake in maintenance hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>). Another important goal is a normotensive patient (without antihypertensive medications) who is maintained at estimated dry weight to minimize any dialysis-induced cardiovascular risk factors.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Collins AJ, Foley RN, Herzog C, et al.
