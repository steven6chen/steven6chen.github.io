Most procedures are now performed with drug-eluting stents, which are associated with a lower rate of restenosis than bare-metal stents. A concern about a somewhat higher rate of very late stent thrombosis relative to bare metal stents exists, but ongoing trials should effectively address this issue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-eluting intracoronary stents: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will address some of the technical aspects of PCI, as well as adjunctive medications when used in the periprocedural period. Issues related to the performance of primary PCI will be reviewed here. The determinants of outcome, the clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of primary PCI compared with fibrinolytic therapy, selection of a reperfusion strategy, the possible role of PCI after fibrinolysis, and the role of PCI in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes are discussed separately.

Many of these major bleeds occur in relation to the access site for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), particularly when the femoral artery is used. The risk of bleeding is lower with radial artery access. In patients undergoing primary PCI, we prefer the radial to the femoral approach if performed by skilled operators.

At one-year follow-up, direct stenting was associated with a significantly lower rate of all-cause death (1.6 versus 3.8 percent). </p><p>Direct stenting also may improve myocardial perfusion and the incidence of death, MI, or heart failure compared to conventional stenting in patients who undergo PCI after fibrinolysis. This was illustrated in an observational study in which the choice of procedure was at the discretion of the treating physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-periprocedural-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

However, first generation stents are rarely being used in practice.
