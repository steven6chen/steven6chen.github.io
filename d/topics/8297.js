Possessions thus congest and clutter their living areas, compromising use of these spaces, interfere with the individual&rsquo;s daily life and cause clinically significant distress. </p><p>Hoarding disorder was newly included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], replacing its conceptualization in DSM-IV as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The point prevalence of hoarding disorder has been estimated to be approximately 1.5 percent among adult men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of hoarding disorder are described here.

Research, however, has found that most individuals who show hoarding behavior do not endorse other symptoms of OCD and has further delineated the differences between the two constructs. This culminated in the inclusion of hoarding disorder in DSM-5, separate from OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The only study that used strict DSM-5 criteria, however, found a lower prevalence, 1.5 percent, in both men and women in England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In our and others&rsquo; clinical experience, comorbidities, rather than the hoarding, are often the main reason for clinical consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290003387\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1674685780\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic and environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although controlled family studies have not been carried out, patient reports have suggested that hoarding runs in families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A handful of twin studies conducted in large, population-based adult twin samples have consistently suggested that this familiarity is largely attributable to additive genetic factors (with heritabilities ranging between 36 and 50 percent), with the remaining variance attributable to nonshared environmental factors and measurement error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which either genetic or environmental factors, or their interaction, confer risk to the development of hoarding disorder remain unknown. Specific genes implicated in hoarding disorder have not yet been identified. Although research has suggested some unique environmental risk factors (eg, traumatic life events), small samples and retrospective self-report methods leave unclear the role of such exposures in the onset or exacerbation of hoarding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. Anecdotal links between material deprivation and hoarding activity have, meanwhile, received no support in the relevant literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Future work is warranted to understand how specific genetic and environmental risk factors interact to confer risk to individuals carefully diagnosed as having hoarding disorder. It is likely that these genetic and environmental risk factors will be, at least in part, shared with related conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other related disorders, as suggested in a population-based twin study using self-report measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The etiological links between hoarding disorder and other neuropsychiatric conditions (eg, anxiety and mood disorders, <span class=\"nowrap\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity</span> disorder) remain to be explored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3894443227\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the initial neuropsychological studies recruited OCD patients with hoarding symptoms (with different degrees of severity), whereas others recruited individuals with severe hoarding but predominantly without OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The neuropsychological tests employed have been heterogeneous and have tapped into different domains, and few studies employed psychiatric control groups. Findings to date suggest possible impairments in spatial planning, visuospatial learning and memory, sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">attention/working</span> memory, organization, response inhibition, set shifting, probabilistic learning, and reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The neural substrates of hoarding behavior in nonhuman animals are well established, but much less is known about normal and abnormal hoarding behavior in humans. Useful clues come from case studies of brain-damaged patients and of individuals with dementia, particularly of the frontotemporal type. This research suggests that the ventromedial <span class=\"nowrap\">prefrontal/anterior</span> cingulate cortices, as well as medial temporal regions, may be implicated in hoarding behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One theory is that the former cortical regions modulate or suppress subcortically driven predispositions to acquire and collect and adjust these predispositions to environmental context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Damage to these cortical regions may result in dysregulated collecting and hoarding behavior. </p><p>The neuroimaging literature of hoarding due to causes other than brain lesions or degenerative disorders (ie, hoarding as a psychiatric symptom) has also implicated the ventromedial <span class=\"nowrap\">prefrontal/anterior</span> cingulate cortices and subcortical limbic structures (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">amygdala/hippocampus)</span> in hoarding patients. The evidence is preliminary, however, obtained from small samples, and confounded in many cases by the presence of comorbid OCD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Future work in this area should include carefully characterized samples of individuals meeting strict criteria for hoarding disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2047323951\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main feature of hoarding disorder is a persistent difficulty with discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value. The most commonly saved items include newspapers, old clothing, bags, books, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not limited to worthless possessions, because many individuals acquire and save valuable things too. </p><p>Discarding difficulties are generally motivated by the perceived utility or aesthetic value of the items, the strong sentimental attachment to the possessions, the fear of losing important information, or a combination of these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The prospect of discarding or parting with possessions usually causes the individual substantial distress, though some individuals, particularly those with poor insight, may not report distress.</p><p>The difficulties result in the disorganized accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromise their intended use. Affected individuals may experience problems functioning amid the clutter &ndash; eg, with sleeping or cooking in cluttered bedrooms and kitchens. In mild cases, the impairment may only be apparent to those around the individual. In severe cases, hoarding can put individuals at risk for fire, falling, and sanitation-related health risks. </p><p>Attempts by others to discard or clear the possessions typically result in high levels of distress. Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism, avoidance, procrastination, and distractibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Characteristic difficulties with planning and organizing can contribute to severe clutter and development of squalor.</p><p>Approximately 63 to 90 percent of persons with hoarding disorder engage in excessive acquisition, ie, of items that are not needed or for which there is no space available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,7,9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,9,22</a>].

It is unclear if animal hoarding is a special manifestation of hoarding disorder, but a study has found that most individuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate objects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2971847448\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective reports of several hundred cases indicate that hoarding difficulties begin early in life and span well into the late stages.

A steady worsening of symptoms is typically reported over each decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Validated clinician-rated and self-administered questionnaires can also help with this process. (See <a href=\"#H1125115409\" class=\"local\">'Assessment instruments'</a> below.)</p><p>A home visit is recommended for the assessment of clutter, impairment, and associated risks. If a home visit is not feasible, the clinician should try to gather additional information from reliable informants, such as a spouse or relative (with the patient&rsquo;s consent). This is particularly important for affected persons with limited insight because they may underestimate the extent and consequences of their difficulties. Informants may help establish whether the current presentation is long-standing or transient, whether third parties have intervened to clear away some of the clutter, and whether there are potential risks that require attention.</p><p>Photographs of the patient&rsquo;s home can be useful in helping to document the presence of clinically significant clutter and to track treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], particularly when home visits are not possible or are impractical. Photographs are not a substitute for a thorough psychopathological interview.</p><p>The diagnostic interview provides an opportunity to carry out a thorough risk assessment. Attention should be paid to potential fire hazards, the risk of a clutter avalanche, the presence of rodent or insect infestation, or other unsanitary living conditions that pose a risk to health. It is important to establish whether other vulnerable persons (eg, children and elderly people) live with the person who is hoarding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1125115409\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199937783.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199937783-appendix-1?print=pdf&amp;token=J0RfdsEsNii8L1zyavcM+fvGFyVJmo84MoW9Vikx1qvmYEMAXRA1tbYszI2IpxsdqMxq47TuSb12GhSYK7yVtW6VTQrTblBDGcdCH2yvdTjzzXQOveVeAnZ64eHf72iCl0K+xBHJWD3bY+p4zXaLrg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=90015\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Structured Interview for Hoarding Disorder</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] based on DSM-5 criteria can be used to facilitate a diagnostic interview. </p><p>Numerous clinician and self-administered instruments can be used to quantify the severity of hoarding disorder and changes over time, eg, in response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30-33</a>].

Some of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are able to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to be very reluctant to discard anything [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurodevelopmental disorders</strong> &ndash; Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability.

Onset of the accumulating behavior is typically gradual and follows onset of the neurocognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied with self-neglect and severe domestic squalor (where there is trash, rotten food, or excrement), alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibition, gambling, <span class=\"nowrap\">rituals/stereotypies,</span> tics, and self-injurious behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> &ndash; A patient with OCD may present with hoarding symptoms. He or she would not be diagnosed with a hoarding disorder if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears of contamination or harm, or symmetry obsessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As examples, patients may not want to discard objects they have touched due to a fear of contaminating other people. They may also present with superstitious thoughts associated with discarding (eg, fear of catastrophic consequences if items are discarded or are not discarded in ritualistic ways) or have fears of being prosecuted if they accidentally discard items containing personal information. The accumulation of objects can be the result of persistently avoiding onerous rituals (eg, not discarding in order to avoid endless washing or checking rituals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symmetry obsessions and compulsions are the most commonly associated with this form of hoarding. As an example, patients may not discard in order to avoid feelings of incompleteness or in an attempt to document and preserve all life experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In OCD, hoarding behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual experiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if excessive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (eg, the need to buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people), not because of a genuine desire to possess the items. These individuals are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair, used diapers, or rotten food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

When hoarding presents in schizophrenia, the clinical picture continues to be dominated by the symptoms of schizophrenia, which will assist the clinician with the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Major depressive episode</strong> &ndash; Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of energy during a major depressive episode. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Healthy collecting</strong> &ndash; Pathological hoarding must be distinguished from normative or healthy collecting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This is particularly relevant because quite a few individuals meeting criteria for hoarding disorder define themselves as &ldquo;collectors,&rdquo; as they perceive this term as being somewhat less pejorative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Normative collecting is a common activity that is both benign and pleasurable. Most children and up to 30 percent of adults collect items at some point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Collectors report the acquisition of, attachment to, and reluctance to discard objects, but they do not have the disorganized clutter, distress, and impairment that is characteristic of hoarding disorder. In contrast to hoarding, the process of collecting is highly structured and planned, very selective (ie, confined to a narrow range of items), pleasurable, and often a social activity. Most collectors, even those who might be considered eccentric, are unlikely to meet the diagnostic criteria for hoarding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1800422811\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

They perceive a need to save the items and typically experience distress when facing the prospect of discarding things. Possessions thus congest and clutter their living areas, compromising use of these spaces, interfere with the individual&rsquo;s daily life and cause clinically significant distress. (See <a href=\"#H3117315259\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarding disorder was newly included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), replacing its conceptualization in DSM-IV as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Research has found that most individuals who show hoarding behavior do not have other symptoms of OCD. (See <a href=\"#H1250075430\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The point prevalence of hoarding disorder has been estimated to be approximately 1.5 percent among adult men and women. Individuals with hoarding disorder tend to be older, more frequently unemployed, and more often unmarried, separated, or divorced compared with individuals from the general community. (See <a href=\"#H1352692204\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The central feature of hoarding disorder is a persistent difficulty discarding possessions. The prospect of parting with these items typically causes the individual substantial distress. A majority of affected individuals also engage in excessive acquisition. Accumulation of possessions characteristically clutter their living areas, causing impairment, and sometimes creating risks of harm, eg, from fire, injury, or sanitation-related illness. (See <a href=\"#H2047323951\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarding difficulties appear to start early in life and span well into the late stages. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoarding is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course. (See <a href=\"#H2971847448\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening questions can be useful to identify hoarding behavior in patients who present with other anxiety, trauma-related, or obsessive-compulsive disorders (see <a href=\"#H4289292263\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1571000463\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you find it difficult to discard or part with possessions? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you have a large number of possessions that congest and clutter the main rooms in your home? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of hoarding disorder includes medical conditions (eg, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, central nervous system infections, and Prader-Willi syndrome), neurodegenerative and neurocognitive disorders, OCD, schizophrenia, and major depression.
