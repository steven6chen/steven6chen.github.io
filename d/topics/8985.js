The following is a general review of the settings available on the mechanical ventilator; more detailed information is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, some parameters need to be set for every patient (eg, fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO<sub>2</sub>]) whereas others, such as tidal volume (V<sub>t</sub>) or inspiratory time (I<sub>T</sub>), are dependent on the mode of ventilation selected (see <a href=\"#H1514500685\" class=\"local\">'Modes of ventilation'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tidal volume (V</strong><strong><sub>t</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; V<sub>t</sub> is the quantity of gas delivered with each breath. In general, target tidal volumes in pediatrics range between 5 and 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of ideal body weight (IBW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)</strong> &ndash; PEEP is the airway pressure at the end of expiration. PEEP is important in preventing airway closure or alveolar collapse and can improve oxygenation. Initial PEEP settings of 5 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O are commonly used in pediatrics. The required PEEP depends largely on the disease process(es). In patients with low lung compliance from acute lung injury or increased abdominal pressure, higher PEEP may be necessary to oxygenate the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)</strong> &ndash; PIP is the maximal airway pressure reached during a delivered breath. Ventilators may allow PIP to be set directly or may have a setting for the delta pressure. PIP is the sum of the PEEP plus the delta pressure. PIP may also be a dependent variable in modes in which tidal volume is set.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure support</strong> &ndash; Pressure support is the amount of support provided by the ventilator to augment each spontaneous breath. Pressure support can be used by itself or in conjunction with other modes of ventilation (see <a href=\"#H1514500685\" class=\"local\">'Modes of ventilation'</a> below). Common settings are 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, based upon effectiveness of respiratory effort and the diameter of the endotracheal tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory rate (RR)</strong> &ndash; RR is the number of breaths per minute. The RR may include programmed breaths from the ventilator, spontaneous breaths from the patient, or a combination of the two.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inspiratory time (I</strong><strong><sub>T</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; I<sub>T</sub> is the period of time over which the ventilator delivers a breath. Initial settings are largely dependent on age but may be adjusted based on underlying pathophysiology. I<sub>T</sub> can also be defined in relation to expiration and the respiratory cycle. The normal I:E ratio is 1:2 or 1:3, although this may be adjusted to 1:4 to 1:6 or greater to allow a greater expiratory time in the presence of obstructive airway disease. (See <a href=\"#H368582681\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; Initial FiO<sub>2</sub> is set based on the patient&rsquo;s supplemental oxygen requirement prior to intubation and the clinicians overall assessment of the patient&rsquo;s needs. For patients with initial requirements &gt;0.6, the clinician should ensure planned weaning to a FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.6 or lower when possible. Common target parameters include maintaining oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 92 to 97 percent for patients with healthy lungs, but permitting a SpO<sub>2</sub> of 88 to 92 percent or an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;55 mmHg for patients with severe lung disease or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trigger</strong> &ndash; The trigger is the mechanism by which the ventilator initiates an assisted breath. In pediatrics, changes in airflow are used most commonly to trigger breaths, although negative deflection of pressure can also be used. Trigger thresholds are adjusted for age, typically from 0.4 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> for infants and up to 0.8 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> for adolescents. Pressure trigger threshold is commonly set at -1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in pediatrics. In those patients without adequate spontaneous respiratory effort, time can be a trigger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Flow rate</strong> &ndash; Flow rates and patterns vary based upon the ventilator mode chosen and clinician settings. The peak inspiratory flow rate can be set directly on the ventilator (constant inspiratory flow modes) or can be calculated by the ventilator for a set V<sub>t</sub> (or PIP) and I<sub>T</sub> (variable inspiratory flow modes). Higher inspiratory flow rates in obstructive airway disease may allow breaths to be delivered more rapidly, facilitating prolongation of the exhalation time. The inspiratory flow pattern can be adjusted based on the mode of ventilation chosen (eg, variable decelerating flow in pressure-controlled or pressure regulated volume-controlled ventilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cycling</strong> &ndash; Cycling identifies the method by which the ventilator is programmed to transition (ie, cycle) from an active inspiratory breath to passive exhalation. Ventilators can be set to use flow or time to define this transition. Flow cycling is commonly set at 25 percent of peak inspiratory flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1514500685\"><span class=\"h1\">MODES OF VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No mode of standard ventilation has been demonstrated to be superior to any other in improving outcomes in pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There are three categories of modes of standard ventilation, each with different advantages and disadvantages (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assist control (AC)</strong> &ndash; All programmed breaths are delivered within a fixed inspiratory time (I<sub>T</sub>). A minimum preset number of breaths are delivered, though a patient may breathe above the programmed respiratory rate. Each breath may be initiated by either the patient or the ventilator, but once initiated, the ventilator will deliver the entire breath during the selected I<sub>T</sub> or I:E ratio. This mode of ventilation might be used in a patient who has little or no spontaneous respiratory effort either due to pharmacologic sedation with or without neuromuscular blockade, or secondary to underlying illness or injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spontaneous (supported) ventilation</strong> &ndash; All breaths are spontaneous (ie, patient initiated), and the ventilator augments the patient effort with pressure or volume as set by the clinician. The most common support mode is pressure support ventilation (PSV). PSV applies positive pressure for the duration of each spontaneous breath, thereby increasing tidal volume and offloading the work of breathing. PSV can be used in spontaneously breathing children, to overcome the resistance of an endotracheal tube and ventilator circuit, to offload work of breathing, and to increase tidal volume. It can be used to provide full ventilatory support for a patient with adequate spontaneous respiratory effort. Such a breath type is characterized by a variable inspiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">time/I:E</span> ratio as determined breath-to-breath by the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Synchronous</strong> <strong>intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)</strong> &ndash; SIMV provides a range of support. The patient's ventilation includes a combination of mandatory and spontaneous breaths. Either the patient or the ventilator can initiate each supported breath, for which the ventilator will deliver the entire breath up to the set respiratory rate. All spontaneous patient breaths beyond the programmed minimum will be unsupported by the ventilator (unless additional PS is specifically programmed, called SIMV + PS). With SIMV, the ventilator breaths are synchronized with patient inspiratory effort. When a mandatory breath is due, the ventilator will wait very briefly for the patient to initiate. If no spontaneous breath is identified, time will trigger the ventilator. With SIMV, the ventilator settings can be adjusted to titrate the amount of support provided. SIMV is the most common mode of ventilation used in pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Each of the above mode types of mechanical ventilation can be either pressure-controlled, volume-controlled (also called pressure- or volume-limited), or a combination of both as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure-controlled ventilation</strong> &ndash; In pressure-controlled ventilation, the clinician sets the peak pressure (as peak inspiratory pressure [PIP] or delta pressure) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113558 \">figure 1</a>). Each breath is delivered over a preset inspiratory time (I<sub>T</sub>). As a result, tidal volume and inspiratory flow will be variable, based largely upon the patient's respiratory mechanics (eg, lung compliance and airway resistance). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volume-controlled ventilation</strong> &ndash; With volume-controlled ventilation, the tidal volume and inspiratory flow rate (square wave, constant flow) are set on the ventilator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F113559\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113559 \">figure 2</a>). As a result, the tidal volume will be consistently delivered with each breath with variable peak inspiratory pressures. The flow rate can be adjusted to change the I<sub>T </sub>(see <a href=\"#H1659959031\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator settings'</a> above). This approach can be particularly important in ventilating patients with inadequate ventilation from obstructive lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H368582681\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate ventilation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-severe-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-endotracheal-intubation-and-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute severe asthma exacerbations in children: Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dual-controlled ventilation (eg,</strong> <strong>pressure-regulated volume control [PRVC])</strong> &ndash; PRVC is a type of ventilation in which breaths are pressure controlled, but the ventilator adjusts the inspiratory flow to target a desired tidal volume. If the delivered tidal volume is low, the ventilator increases the inspiratory pressure on the subsequent breath. This permits effective breath-by-breath tidal volume delivery while minimizing peak pressures by adapting to the changing respiratory mechanics (resistance and compliance) in the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H645088792\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation is associated with a number of pathophysiologic derangements which can lead to injury. Among these are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished cardiac output and hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary barotrauma (eg, pneumothorax)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (ie, intrinsic PEEP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated intracranial pressure</p><p/><p>These complications are discussed in detail elsewhere but are briefly described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypotension and VALI, including barotrauma, are among the more important problems that occur after the institution of mechanical ventilation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension most often results from a combination of sedation, decreased venous return from elevated intrathoracic pressure, and diminished intravascular volume. These complications are often observed immediately after endotracheal intubation; hence, close monitoring during the post-intubation period is imperative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barotrauma results from elevated pulmonary pressures. Clinicians can reduce the risk of barotrauma by minimizing plateau airway pressures, which is the pressure being applied to the small airways and alveoli. Plateau pressure is determined during a period of no airflow (eg during an inspiratory pause) and is used to determine the static compliance of the lung. Reduced airway pressures, as well as reduced tidal volumes, also help minimize the risk of VALI. Clinicians need to be aware that some abnormalities, such as an elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub>, need not be corrected immediately to achieve physiologic norms or the patient&rsquo;s baseline, and that attempts to do so may increase the risk of VALI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H888613324\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation, also known as positive pressure ventilation, involves partial support or complete replacement of spontaneous breathing. For these purposes, indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation following acute illness or injury may be categorized as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate oxygenation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to maintain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protect the airway</p><p/><p>Initial ventilatory strategies vary based on these indications for intubation and the underlying disease processes. For example, children requiring mechanical ventilation for inadequate oxygenation (eg, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome) will be ventilated differently than those with inadequate ventilation (eg, asthma) or those with healthy lungs who are intubated for airway protection (eg, depressed mental status from head injury or status epilepticus) or <span class=\"nowrap\">procedures/surgery</span>. This topic will review the initiation of mechanical ventilation for acute illness and injury in children. Guidelines are provided; however, clinicians will need to individualize strategies based on the clinical scenario as well as provider preferences and institutional practice.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure-controlled ventilation is commonly utilized in pediatrics, particularly in neonates and infants. Ventilator measurement of tidal volume may be less accurate in infants, potentially affecting volume-controlled ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, trials in pediatrics have NOT shown any mode to be superior to another in improving outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial pressure settings can be established based upon pressures identified during manual ventilation with a bag and a <span class=\"nowrap\">manometer/standalone</span> respiratory mechanics monitor prior to switching to the ventilator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation should provide sufficient minute ventilation and oxygen delivery (by increasing arterial oxygen content) to meet metabolic demands at the lowest pressures possible to minimize risk of secondary lung injury (ie, permissive hypercapnia and mild hypoxemia may be acceptable) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation should aim to optimize the patient's work of breathing and comfort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fraction of inspired oxygen should be reduced as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.

Given the lack of definitive data for the best ventilation strategy in children, variation in practice is likely to exist for individual clinical scenarios as well as across providers and institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Consultation with an expert in the mechanical ventilation of children (eg, pediatric intensivist or pediatric anesthesiologist) is strongly encouraged. This section provides a suggested approach based upon the primary indication for mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Of utmost importance, the provider must assess ventilator settings shortly after initiation and frequently thereafter as the natural course of the underlying pathophysiology evolves.</p><p>The indications and use of noninvasive ventilation is provided separately.

Nonetheless, use of lower tidal volumes with PEEP titration has been associated with fewer complications and a trend towards lower mortality. Thus, lung protective ventilation has become widely used in children with PARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/1,2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,13</a>]. Indirect evidence in adults show improved mortality rate and reduced ventilator days for patients with ARDS managed using this strategy.

Therefore, if significant hypercapnia or acidosis develop, the respiratory rate (RR) may need to be increased beyond physiologic levels but below the rate at which auto-PEEP occurs (ie, increased PEEP due to lack of complete exhalation on the flow-time scalar on the ventilators&rsquo; airway graphics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This may result from slow or ineffective respirations, often secondary to neurologic compromise or from muscle fatigue secondary to prolonged increased work of breathing. Alternatively, obstructive airway disease and an inability to adequately exhale can result in progressive hypercarbia. The ventilator approaches to these etiologies will vary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497001739\"><span class=\"h3\">Ineffective respiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hypercarbia from insufficient respiratory effort due to muscle weakness or altered mental status (eg, coma or seizures) can be managed similar to those intubated and ventilated for airway protection.

This maneuver removes a large number of potential problems and enables the clinician to concentrate on the patient, rather than the ventilator.</p><p>The clinician can then approach the patient like any other intubated patient in respiratory distress, beginning with assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Look for immediate threats to life, such as a dislodged or obstructed endotracheal tube, a tension pneumothorax, disruption of the oxygen supply, or dysrhythmia. Perform a focused assessment of recent events and a physical examination including vital signs. The nurse and respiratory therapist may provide important history. Assess trends in ventilator parameters, such as rising airway pressures. If the cause of distress is not immediately apparent and easily rectified, obtain an immediate portable chest radiograph. Appropriately trained providers can use point of care ultrasound for immediate assessment of endotracheal tube position, presence of pneumothorax or pleural fluid, and cardiac function.</p><p>A useful mnemonic for the causes of unexpected, acute decompensation of mechanically ventilated patients is DOPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-mechanical-ventilation-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>D</strong>islodgement of the endotracheal tube (ETT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>O</strong>bstruction of the ETT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>P</strong>neumothorax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>E</strong>quipment failure</p><p/><p>Once these causes have been ruled out, the physicians can resume mechanical ventilation. </p><p>Further care includes evaluation of the patient's respiratory mechanics; determination of the adequacy of sedation, analgesia, and ventilatory support; and treatment of any underlying cause of patient-ventilator dyssynchrony.</p><p>Often, respiratory distress can be managed by observing the patient's breathing pattern and by adjusting controlled variables (eg, tidal volume, respiratory rate, inspiratory flow rate, trigger sensitivity) to match patient demand.
