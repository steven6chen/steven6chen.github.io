By definition, only 5 percent of healthy individuals will have a result below this LLN. </p><p>Prior to this, a traditional rule of thumb was to use 80 percent of predicted as the LLN for most pulmonary function test results. This standard works fairly well for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and total lung capacity (TLC) in middle-aged adults, but gives a high rate of false positive or false negatives for FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC,</span> forced expiratory flow (FEF, also called maximum midexpiratory flow) 25 to 75 percent, and maximal respiratory pressures, especially when used for adolescents and adults over the age of 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The use of the LLN rather than a fixed ratio cut off (eg FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> 0.7) to define airflow obstruction reduces the misclassification that occurs with a fixed ratio approach. The fixed ratio tends to under-diagnose younger individuals and over-diagnose older individuals with airflow obstruction and the LLN incorporates the changes in FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> that occur with age and therefore, reduces this misclassification. Categorizing results as &quot;borderline&quot; abnormal if they fall near the LLN is also a useful concept. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Ratio of FEV1/FVC'</a>.)</p><p>Static lung volumes and DLCO values are also abnormal when values are above or below a reference standard, so that the normal range for these studies should include both an upper limit of normal (ULN) and an LLN. </p><p>Even when age, height, sex, and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> are taken into consideration, the &quot;normal&quot; range for measurements of pulmonary function remains wide, often 80 to 120 percent of the predicted value. This means that large changes with disease progression or therapy can easily occur while the patient's values remain within the normal range. Therefore, follow-up pulmonary function tests in adults should be compared with the patient's previous (baseline) values, not the predicted values.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3953346987\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to indoor air pollution, including passive and active exposure to cigarette smoke, and outdoor air pollution can affect lung growth and function.

In addition, cigarette smoking (starting during the early teens) is associated with an earlier peak in lung function and therefore an earlier onset of decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition all of the changes due to aging are accelerated in susceptible cigarette smokers. </p><p>Childhood exposure to air pollution has been associated with reduced pulmonary function in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. It is thought that children are particularly susceptible to the effects of poor air quality as lung development continues during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and because the higher ventilatory rate and greater likelihood of outdoor exercise result in increased exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Both restrictive and obstructive defects have been identified. One cohort study did not find a correlation between air pollution exposure and lung function, but the exposure models used may not have included adjustments for changes in exposure over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During childhood up until puberty, lung function increases linearly in proportion to overall growth, which is determined at least in part by age and sex. Healthy never-smoking adults without exposure to air pollution experience a gradual decline in lung function. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) falls approximately 30 mL per year. The vital capacity decreases while the residual volume increases, leaving the total lung capacity intact. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO; also known as transfer factor) declines linearly with age.

This approach may replace the traditional rule of thumb of using 80 and 120 percent of predicted as the LLN and ULN for most pulmonary function test values.

It is, therefore, important to compare absolute values in lung function parameters when assessing change over time in a given individual.
