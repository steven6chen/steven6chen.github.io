In humans, fatal anaphylaxis is difficult to study because it is rare, unpredictable, and often unwitnessed. In addition, there may be few postmortem findings and laboratory tests may be negative.</p><p>This topic will review the incidence, etiologies, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, possible risk factors, and postmortem diagnosis of fatal anaphylaxis as they pertain to these fundamental questions.

Approximately one-half of all anaphylactic fatalities each year in the United Kingdom register were attributable to medications or agents administered during medical procedures (such as contrast media) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Reactions to foods and insect venoms each accounted for nearly one-quarter of the total cases, with other causes accounting for the remaining cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta-lactam antibiotics (ie, penicillins and cephalosporins) appear to cause more fatalities than other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/8,18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18,22</a>].

Cow's milk and seafood are also leading causes of severe and fatal reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A variety of other foods have been implicated less commonly. At least two cases of fatal food-induced, exercise-associated anaphylaxis have been reported, although exercise or exertion is likely an unrecognized cofactor in other food-induced deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Risk-taking behaviors related to cognitive and emotional development are likely contributing factors. In an internet-based anonymous survey of 176 adolescents and young adults with food allergy, more than one-half reported purposefully ingesting a potentially unsafe food, and 17 percent reported both eating foods that &quot;may contain&quot; allergens and not consistently carrying <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The one reported case of fatal anaphylaxis due to a food challenge occurred in a young child receiving baked milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Although outdoor occupations are often cited as a possible explanation for the predominance of male victims, a 10-year United Kingdom registry reported that only 15 percent of stings occurred at work, while 32 percent occurred in the patient's yard and 39 percent occurred inside the home (including 5 percent in bed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Medication-induced fatal anaphylaxis often occurs in a medically-supervised setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most reported fatal anaphylactic reactions to medications and contrast agents occur in the hospital setting, which may reflect the wider range of agents used in this environment, higher rates of intravenous administration, or patient-related factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/10,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,51</a>]. General anesthesia was associated with more fatalities than other hospital procedures in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

These reactions are most prevalent in the 20 to 30 minutes immediately following administration, and most allergists require patients to wait this amount of time in the clinic after each set of injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The cause of death appears to be determined, at least in part, by the type of allergen. In a review of 56 cases of fatal anaphylaxis for which autopsy data were available, all food-induced reactions involved difficulty breathing, and respiratory arrest was the cause of death in 13 of 16 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In contrast, shock without respiratory compromise was the presentation in most cases of venom- or medication-induced anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This correlation between allergen type and mechanism of death has been noted in many studies and is discussed in greater detail separately.

In the 10-year United Kingdom series, all fatal food reactions occurred in patients taking daily medications for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although guidelines state that all patients with daily symptoms should be treated with inhaled glucocorticoids, many were not taking these agents, and some were using short-acting beta-agonists excessively. In another series of 32 food-induced fatalities, all but one patient had asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Asthma also appears to be common among victims of drug- and venom-induced anaphylaxis, although the correlation is not as strong as that for food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>It is not known if controlling asthma reduces the risk of death from anaphylaxis. Most series have not reported the status of the individual's asthma at the time of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> death, but the study above implies that at least some patients have poorly-controlled symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In contrast, one study of 13 fatal or near-fatal food reactions reported that 12 patients had asthma that was well-controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed or no administration of epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> appears to be critical for survival after severe anaphylaxis. A series of 13 fatal and near-fatal food-induced anaphylactic reactions in children and adolescents suggested that epinephrine is most effective when given in the initial 30 minutes of the reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Epinephrine was administered within this time period in six of seven children who survived, whereas only two of six patients who died received the drug within the first hour.</p><p>Several series have found that only a minority of individuals with fatal anaphylaxis receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> promptly or at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/6,27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27,30</a>]. A United Kingdom series of anaphylactic deaths occurring from 1992 to 1998 found that only 20 percent of patients were given epinephrine at any point in their treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The number of food- and venom-allergic individuals who do not carry their prescribed self-injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is large and discouraging.

It is also possible that patients with cardiac disease are at increased risk for adverse reactions to treatment (especially intravenous boluses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

The term &quot;empty ventricle syndrome&quot; has been applied to this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Patients, caregivers, clinicians, and &quot;first responders&quot; must understand the importance of placing the patient in the supine position with legs elevated if signs of hypotension are present during an allergic reaction.

These cofactors have been noted in both nonfatal and fatal anaphylaxis.</p><p>Beta-blocking agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors interfere with the pharmacologic treatment of and compensatory physiologic responses to anaphylaxis, respectively.

Patients taking these drugs, however, are not clearly over-represented in the literature on fatal anaphylaxis, and the impact of these medications requires further study.</p><p>A variety of other medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, alcohol, and antiulcer therapies, have been implicated in worsening the severity of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These agents are occasionally reported as cofactors in fatal anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTMORTEM DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of fatal anaphylaxis is determined by the clinical presentation and historical information. Autopsy findings and laboratory testing may support the clinical impression, although they are not necessary or sufficient, in isolation, to make the diagnosis. In cases of sudden death of uncertain cause, femoral venous blood can be collected and the serum can be separated and frozen for later analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood collected during or shortly after the event may be analyzed retrospectively for the mast cell-derived mediator tryptase and for evidence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the suspect allergen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tryptase is a mediator released by mast cells upon activation and is relatively specific to this cell type, although basophils also make a small amount. Any elevation is consistent with anaphylaxis. Tryptase levels that are within normal limits do not exclude the diagnosis. Tryptase is seldom elevated in food-induced anaphylaxis. The use of postmortem tryptase levels in the evaluation of possible fatal anaphylaxis is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative IgE immunoassays may be helpful in detecting the presence of allergen-specific IgE in the victim's serum as a means of confirming that the patient was allergic to the allergen in question. Serum IgE levels do not change substantively as a result of anaphylaxis. Positive tests for allergen-specific IgE suggest the presence of sensitization. Negative assays do not exclude sensitization. Serum tests for sensitization to allergens are reviewed separately.

However, in the 16 cases of fatal anaphylaxis (due to a variety of agents) in which tryptase levels were measured, elevations were found in 14. In a series of 25 selected cases of fatal anaphylaxis, serum total tryptase concentrations were elevated in 4 of 7 cases tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Autopsy findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many victims have no distinguishing gross pathologic features at autopsy, particularly if shock develops rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fatal-anaphylaxis/abstract/10,27,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27,51</a>].
