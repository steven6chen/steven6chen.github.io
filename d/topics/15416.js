It may also occur after consumption of contaminated Swiss cheese. The most common findings consist of a rapid onset of flushing of the face and neck, erythematous and urticarial rash, diarrhea, and headache occurring soon after consumption of contaminated fish or cheese. Rarely, severe bronchospasm or cardiac effects may occur in patients with predisposing conditions, such as asthma or heart disease. Because of its clinical presentation, it is frequently misdiagnosed as seafood allergy. For most patients, management consists of treatment with H1 or H2 antihistamines. Patients with life-threatening airway edema, bronchospasm, or distributive shock warrant treatment as for anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of scombroid (histamine) poisoning.

It typically presents in clusters after ingestion of contaminated dark meat fish and is classically associated with consumption of finfish from the Scombroidae and Scomberesocidae families, such as tuna, mackerel, skip-jack, and bonito [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Scombroid poisoning may also take place after ingestion of other types of fish, such as mahi-mahi (dolphin fish), bluefish, amberjack, swordfish, marlin, herring, sardines, anchovies, salmon, tilapia, and trout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] and contaminated Swiss cheese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In resource-rich countries, scombroid fish poisoning more commonly follows consumption of recreational fish catches rather than more highly regulated commercial fish harvests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. </p><p>In the United States and Europe, scombroid fish poisoning accounts for up to 40 percent of seafood-borne illness outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. Between 2000 and 2007, there were 223 outbreaks reported to the United States Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System, representing 865 affected individuals. The majority of cases occurred in Hawaii, Florida, and California, and no deaths were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Population-based estimates range from 2 to 5 annual scombroid fish poisoning outbreaks per million people in Denmark, New Zealand, France, and Finland to as high as 31 annual outbreaks per million people in Hawaii [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. However, because symptoms are of short duration and are often confused with other illnesses, many experts believe that scombroid poisoning is significantly underreported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057426\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scombroid poisoning arises when fish are improperly stored after being caught (temperatures &gt;4&deg;C [40&deg;F]). Under these conditions, the fish undergo bacterial overgrowth, and sustain conversion of histidine, found in dark fish meat, to histamine and other biogenic amines by the bacterial enzyme histidine decarboxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Toxic levels of histamine can accumulate within as short a time as two to three hours in fish stored at 20&deg;C (68&deg;F) or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The responsible bacteria are most commonly <em>Escherichia coli</em>; halophilic Vibrio species; and Proteus, Klebsiella, Clostridium, Salmonella and Shigella species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Scombroid poisoning has also occurred following consumption of Swiss cheese due to bacterial contamination of the raw milk prior to processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Histamine and other toxins are not broken down by cooking, freezing, or subsequent refrigeration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Contaminated fish may smell and appear fresh, although patients with scombroid poisoning may report that the fish tastes &quot;peppery,&quot; &quot;spicy,&quot; or &quot;bubbly&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In some instances, the fish skin can have a honey-combed appearance. Fish contamination frequently occurs when it is refrigerated inadequately at sea but may also happen if the meat is improperly stored at any time prior to consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. Disease can occur even if the vendor selling the fish to the consumer stored the fish properly.</p><p>Although more typically associated with fresh fish, scombroid poisoning can also occur with canned fish if the fish is handled improperly either before canning or after the can is opened; opened cans of tuna should be refrigerated to prevent poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057432\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of scombroid toxicity are consistent with histamine poisoning and usually begin within an hour of eating contaminated fish or cheese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>].</p><p>Typical findings vary in individual patients but include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/1,11,12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12,17,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous flushing of the face and neck with an uncomfortable feeling of intense warmth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythematous and urticarial rash often prominent on the face and upper torso (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90055 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioral burning, itching, or edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest tightness with shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peppery or metallic taste to the fish flesh</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension (distributive shock)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchospasm and respiratory distress (rare)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias (rare)</p><p/><p>Of these findings, flushing, rash, diarrhea, and headache are most frequently described. The more serious respiratory and cardiac findings have been primarily reported in patients with pre-existing conditions (eg, asthma or heart disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In outbreaks, the attack rate among persons consuming the contaminated fish ranges from 50 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Scombroid poisoning usually resolves within 12 to 48 hours if untreated and has no long-term sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>]. However, elderly patients and individuals with pulmonary disease may have a more complicated course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which inhibit histamine metabolism, may be more vulnerable to scombroid poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and have more prolonged or severe physical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. On the other hand, patients taking antihistamines may be protected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The duration of scombroid poisoning also depends upon the amount of contaminated food that was consumed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057438\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A working diagnosis of scombroid poisoning can be made based upon the following clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid onset of symptoms within an hour of a fish meal, especially a scombroid fish (eg, tuna, mackerel, skip-jack, or bonito) or cheese</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing, rash, headache, diarrhea, or other findings consistent with scombroid poisoning (see <a href=\"#H1057432\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar symptoms among other persons who ate the same fish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt improvement after antihistamine administration</p><p/><p>If available, fish can be examined for histamine levels by a variety of different laboratory methods to confirm the working diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the United States, histamine levels greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> g of fish tissue are diagnostic of poisoning, while levels greater than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> g of fish are considered potentially toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In Europe, critical levels are 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in untreated fish and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in fish that have undergone enzyme maturation in brine. If specimens are being sent out for analysis, they should be frozen. Local health department officials can be helpful in obtaining fish samples from restaurants, grocery stores, and other commercial vendors when the diagnosis is suspected.</p><p>If the fish sample is still available, skin prick testing can be conducted in an allergist's office [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although not routinely performed, plasma histamine levels ranging from two to four times the normal upper limit of 10.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> were reported in five patients who presented within four hours after ingesting contaminated fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The plasma histamine levels normalized at 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1057444\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous flushing similar to that seen in patients with scombroid poisoning may occur in patients with a variety of other conditions. However, the rapid onset of flushing after ingestion of a fish meal distinguishes scombroid poisoning from most other causes. The approach to flushing in adults is described in detail separately and provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68454\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68454 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-flushing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to flushing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myocardial infarction, allergic reaction, staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced food poisoning, and other types of marine foodborne poisoning are additional considerations when evaluating a patient for suspected scombroid poisoning.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myocardial ischemia or infarction</strong> &ndash; The chest tightness, difficulty breathing, sweating, and nausea sometimes associated with scombroid poisoning can simulate the clinical presentation of myocardial ischemia or infarction in adults. Serial ECG and cardiac biomarkers adequately differentiate the etiology of chest pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic reaction</strong> &ndash; Patients with obstructing upper airway edema, hypotension, or bronchospasm warrant treatment as for anaphylaxis regardless of the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1057450\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Allergic reactions to seafood can mimic scombroid poisoning. However, lack of a history of allergy to fish, clustering of symptoms among patients who ate the same fish, and, if available, documentation of elevated histamine levels in the fish can establish the diagnosis of scombroid fish poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. If a concern for fish allergy persists, a blood test for IgE specific to the fish in question can be obtained or, after resolution of symptoms, the patient may be referred to an allergist for later skin testing and possible challenge to the fish in question. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seafood allergies: Fish and shellfish&quot;, section on 'Scombroid poisoning'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced food poisoning</strong> &ndash; <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> enterotoxin may cause abrupt onset of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps approximately one hour after eating contaminated food. These symptoms may be similar to those patients with scombroid who primarily manifest gastrointestinal symptoms. However, patients with staphylococcal food poisoning may develop a fever, which is not seen in patients with scombroid poisoning. Also, unlike those with staphylococcal enterotoxin food poisoning, patients with scombroid poisoning typically have flushing or a rash. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings#H2779282270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Vomiting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other marine foodborne poisoning</strong> &ndash; Symptoms of poisoning caused by other marine species, such as ciguatera poisoning, various types of shellfish poisoning, and pufferfish poisoning are distinguished by a longer latent period between consumption and onset of symptoms and the presence of findings not typical of scombroid poisoning including paresthesias and temperature-related dysesthesia (ciguatera and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning), paralysis (paralytic shellfish and pufferfish poisoning), and prolonged diarrhea without a rash.

Parenteral administration is appropriate for patients with moderate to severe symptoms; patients with milder symptoms may receive oral antihistamines. Experience suggests that signs and symptoms of poisoning typically resolve within 30 minutes of antihistamine administration in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/11,19,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19,26,27</a>].

However, fish can become contaminated with scombroid on fishing boats, far from the consumer. In the 1990s, many experts noted that much of the scombroid contaminated fish entering in the United States came from off the coast of Central America, where it was often caught on long lines and improperly refrigerated at sea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. More recently recreational fish catches have become the most common source of contaminated fish for developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>].</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has instituted a mandatory Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system, under which all United States fish processors and importers must identify the points at which fish contamination may occur and must come up with a plan to prevent contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. The FDA and United States Customs and Border Protection also inspect thousands of seafood shipments annually in an attempt to protect consumers.

(See <a href=\"#H1057426\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of scombroid toxicity usually begin within an hour of eating contaminated fish and commonly include flushing of the face and neck with an uncomfortable feeling of intense warmth, an erythematous and urticarial rash often prominent on the face and upper torso (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90055 \">picture 1</a>), diarrhea, and headache. Perioral burning or itching, dizziness, palpitations, tachycardia, may also be present. Rarely, severe bronchospasm with respiratory distress, hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias may occur, especially in patients with underlying conditions such as asthma or heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H1057432\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A working diagnosis of scombroid poisoning can be made based upon the following clinical findings (see <a href=\"#H1057438\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid onset of symptoms soon after consuming fish, especially a scombroid fish (eg, tuna, mackerel, skip-jack, or bonito)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flushing, rash, headache, diarrhea, or other findings consistent with scombroid poisoning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Similar symptoms among other persons who ate the same fish</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prompt improvement after antihistamine administration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated histamine levels in the fish meat and skin prick testing can confirm the working diagnosis. Local health department officials can be helpful in obtaining fish samples from restaurants, grocery stores, and other commercial vendors when the diagnosis is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H1057438\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous flushing similar to that seen in patients with scombroid poisoning may occur in patients with a variety of other conditions. However, the rapid onset of flushing after ingestion of a fish meal distinguishes scombroid poisoning from most other causes. The approach to flushing in adults is described in detail separately and provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68454\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68454 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1057444\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to seafood can mimic scombroid poisoning. However, lack of a history of allergy to fish, clustering of symptoms among patients who ate the same fish, and, if available, documentation of elevated histamine levels in the fish <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin prick testing can establish the diagnosis of scombroid fish poisoning. Myocardial ischemia or infarction, staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced food poisoning, and other types of marine foodborne poisoning are additional diagnoses to consider. (See <a href=\"#H1057444\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, scombroid poisoning can present with obstructing upper airway edema, hypotension or bronchospasm. Patients with these findings warrant treatment as for anaphylaxis as shown in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1057450\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;, section on 'Immediate management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients without respiratory distress or hypotension but with significant discomfort from flushing, burning, rash, itching, or perioral edema receive parenteral H1 or H2 antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a>) rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Experience suggests that signs and symptoms of poisoning typically resolve rapidly after antihistamine administration in such patients. Fluid repletion is warranted in patients with hypovolemia from vomiting or diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H1057450\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician should contact the local public health authorities to assist in confirming the diagnosis of scombroid poisoning and to prevent further consumption of contaminated fish by others. Patients ultimately diagnosed with scombroid should be educated about the condition and informed that it differs from a fish allergy. (See <a href=\"#H1057450\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid chilling of fish below 4&deg;C (40&deg;F), immediately after being caught is the single most effective measure to prevent the accumulation of histamine and subsequent scombroid poisoning. (See <a href=\"#H1057456\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scombroid-histamine-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fleming LE, Washington G.
