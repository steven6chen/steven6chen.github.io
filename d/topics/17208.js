The throat includes the area from the back of the nose and mouth to the windpipe and esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83210\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83210 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different types of throat cancer, depending on the part of the throat and cells involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19882998\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of throat cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend a lot on where in the throat the cancer is. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouth sores or bleeding in the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hoarse voice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A long-lasting cough or coughing up blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lump in the neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain, hearing loss, or ringing in the ears</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not throat cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883013\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for throat cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. During the exam, he or she might use a special mirror to look in your throat.</p><p>Your doctor will also probably look down your throat using a &quot;scope,&quot; which is a thin tube with a camera and light on the end. During this procedure, he or she might do a test called a biopsy. For a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from the area that looks like cancer. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p>It's also possible that you will have an imaging test, such as an MRI, CT, or PET scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883028\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the type and stage of your throat cancer and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883043\"><span class=\"h1\">How is throat cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for throat cancer involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the cancer &ndash; Sometimes, the surgeon needs to remove part of your throat in order to remove the cancer. If this happens, he or she will &quot;rebuild&quot; your throat during surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p>After treatment with surgery or radiation, people can have problems chewing, eating, or talking. If this happens, you will have treatment called rehabilitation, or &quot;rehab&quot; for short. During rehab, doctors, nurses, and other health professionals will work with you on chewing, eating, and talking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883058\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests can include exams, blood tests, and imaging tests. People who are treated for throat cancer also need to take care of their teeth and see their dentist for regular follow-ups.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your throat cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883073\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my throat cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your throat cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883088\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for throat cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883103\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tongue-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tongue cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngeal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Laryngeal cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysphagia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysphagia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mouth-sores-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mouth sores (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
