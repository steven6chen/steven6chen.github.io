Diverticulitis in western countries usually involves the sigmoid colon, and fistulization most frequently arises from this segment. The major types of fistulas are colovesical fistulas (65 percent, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69515\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69515 \">image 1</a>)) and colovaginal fistulas (25 percent), followed by coloenteric and colouterine fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, a fistula can form to whichever organ the inflammatory process tracks, and has been described in many unexpected sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52969\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52969 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Diverticulitis is also the most common cause of a colovesical fistula, accounting for 40 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although diverticulitis occurs with a slight female predominance, colovesical fistulas secondary to diverticulitis has a distinct (2 to 3:1) male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. It is likely that the uterus protects the bladder from the inflamed sigmoid; this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the majority of women with colovesical or colovaginal fistulas have had a previous hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colovesical fistulas illustrate the features of most diverticular fistulas. Only approximately one-half of patients have a history of diverticulitis; in the remainder, diverticulosis is diagnosed when the fistula becomes clinically evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Affected patients often give a history of passage of stool and gas via the involved organ. Thus, common symptoms with a colovesical fistula include pneumaturia, dysuria, or irritative symptoms, and fecaluria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. Other symptoms occurring in fewer than 50 percent of patients are crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematuria, and passage of urine per rectum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Physical examination is frequently unremarkable. The urinalysis is invariably abnormal and cultures reveal the nonspecific finding of polymicrobial growth.</p><p>These findings occurring together are suggestive of a colovesical fistula, but not of the etiology. Causes other than diverticulitis include Crohn's colitis and carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema (BE), colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and intravenous urography (IVU) have all been employed for the diagnosis of colovesical fistula. The diagnostic yield of each modality varies widely in different hands.</p><p>The direct yield (eg, visualization of the fistula) from both BE and endoscopy tends to be low (20 to 26 percent and 0 to 3 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, these studies are valuable in assessing the remainder of the colon and there may be abnormalities suggestive of the diagnosis in up to 100 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enemas and 25 percent of endoscopies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>CT scan is obtained if the diagnosis is unconfirmed after these studies or if further anatomic delineation is required. In some cases, the fistula itself is opacified. However, the diagnosis is usually made by the combination of local colonic thickening adjacent to an area of thickened bladder, associated diverticula, and oral contrast material or air in the bladder (prior to instrumentation of the urinary tract); this constellation of findings is highly sensitive and specific for colovesical fistula from diverticular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Air bubbles within organs other than the bowel are also highly suggestive of fistulization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Thus, CT accurately predicts the presence of a fistula. It may also provide information regarding extraluminal inflammation, particularly regarding the relationship between a phlegmon and the ureters.</p><p>Cystoscopy is highly recommended by some authors. As with the other diagnostic modalities, direct visualization of the fistula is uncommon. However, the diagnosis is suggested by localized inflammation and bullous edema of the bladder mucosa in up to 96 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Others, however, consider such findings too nonspecific, and find cystoscopy to be useful in only approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Intravenous urography is rarely useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diverticular fistulas do not generally close spontaneously; nevertheless, the presence of a fistula is rarely an indication for urgent surgical intervention. An elective one-stage procedure with resection and primary anastomosis should be feasible in the majority of cases. If conditions are suboptimal due to extensive inflammation, operation in two stages may be necessary. The one-stage procedure is associated with decreased morbidity and length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The portion of the colon responsible for the origin of the fistula (usually the sigmoid colon) should be dealt with in the same manner as when diverticular surgery is performed for other indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-colonic-diverticulitis-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute colonic diverticulitis: Surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laparoscopic approaches for complex fistulizing diverticular disease are gaining acceptance because of increasing experience and improved instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Such complex cases should probably not be approached laparoscopically by surgeons who are early in the learning curve.</p><p>Management of the bladder aspect depends upon the size of the defect and surgeon preference. In most patients, the fistula can be &quot;pinched off&quot; with either no visible defect in the bladder or a very small defect; management in this setting ranges from merely leaving an indwelling bladder catheter for 7 to 10 days, to additionally placing a few sutures over the site and leaving a closed suction drain behind the bladder. With a larger defect, simple closure is usually preferred to formal resection and repair, which is almost never necessary. The local induration will resolve once the inciting cause has been removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Similar principles of minimal intervention apply to the distal aspect of most types of diverticular fistula.</p><p>Although surgical intervention is usually recommended for relief from symptoms, there appears to be little risk to conservative management in selected patients with colovesical fistulas. One small series described six patients who underwent observation for 3 to 14 years, being treated only with prophylactic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-diverticulitis-complicated-by-fistula-formation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were no significant complications, such as impairment of renal function or urinary sepsis. Thus, in the absence of urinary tract obstruction, observation appears safe in patients with contraindications to surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2171673779\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
