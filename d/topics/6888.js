In addition, the action of insulin is improved with exercise training by an increase in the number of glucose transporters that facilitate diffusion of glucose into muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Aerobic exercise also improves the peripheral muscle utilization and extraction of oxygen during exercise in old as well as young patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p>The frequency of anginal symptoms is also reduced by an exercise program. As a result, aerobic exercise is beneficial for <strong>both</strong> primary and secondary prevention of CHD. An exercise training prescription and program for a patient with known coronary disease should be designed according to the individual's health status and current level of physical activity. Prior to the design of such a specific program, it is helpful to perform exercise testing for assessment of risk, prognosis, and functional capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will discuss the testing procedures and requirement for monitoring when exercise assessment is performed and an exercise program is initiated in patients with known CHD, often as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maximal exercise testing is absolutely contraindicated in the presence of active cardiovascular dysfunction such as an acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, or serious arrhythmias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Relative contraindications that can be overridden in certain circumstances with appropriate precautions include significant hypertension and moderate valvular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Emergency departments are increasingly performing exercise tests on patients who present with chest pain and are determined to be low-risk for a cardiac event (patients who are no longer symptomatic, have unremarkable ECGs, and have normal cardiac enzymes). Studies have shown that the use of early exercise testing in emergency department chest pain centers is safe in carefully screened patients and allows for efficient management decisions. However, exercise testing in this setting should be performed within a carefully designed management protocol and only after patients have been screened for high-risk characteristics or other indicators for hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing is considered a relatively safe procedure. The overall risk associated with exercise testing in a mixed-subject population is approximately six cardiac events per 10,000 tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During a maximal exercise test, work rate increases on an ergometric device (ie, speed and grade on a treadmill or resistance on a bicycle ergometer) until the individual reaches his physiologic limit (V<sub>O2</sub>max) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>], which is determined by the maximal cardiac output and peripheral extraction of oxygen. Maximal exercise testing allows the individual to reach his physiologic limit. This is observed when the V<sub>O2</sub> does not rise despite a further increase in work rate or an individual reaches or exceeds his age-predicted maximal heart rate (ie, 220 minus age in years).</p><p>Maximal testing is the most accurate measure of functional capacity, although it requires a highly motivated patient and carries some degree of risk. Submaximal exercise testing implies that the test is terminated at a predetermined point. Examples include a predischarge post-myocardial infarction (MI) exercise test to 70 percent of age-predicted maximal heart rate or a symptom-limited exercise test prior to the initiation of cardiac rehabilitation. </p><p>Various protocols (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70044\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70044 \">table 2</a>) are available for both maximal and submaximal exercise testing (treadmill, bicycle ergometer, step tests, distance runs, walking tests). The decision to select a given protocol is based upon body size, level of physical fitness, functional ability, and available equipment. In order for measurements of time or rate-pressure response to be directly related to the actual cardiac work, the subject must approach a steady-state. This implies that continued exercise at the same intensity would be associated with the same heart and cardiac output. This usually requires two to three minutes of exercise at each stage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;, section on 'Common exercise protocols'</a>.)</p><p>A number of variables may be measured during testing. Clinical exercise testing for the purpose of determining functional (exercise) capacity and serving as the basis for an exercise prescription does not involve expired gas analysis. However, heart rate response to graded exercise and the amount of work performed in metabolic equivalents (METs; or stage of exercise protocol achieved) are typically used to estimate exercise capacity and are surrogates for physiologic parameters (eg, V<sub>O2</sub>, anaerobic threshold, etc). Percentage of expected METs determines if an individual is at, above, or below average for age and sex. The exercise test is used to guide the appropriate training intensity according to measured parameters: heart rate reserve (40 to 80 percent of peak), percent of peak exercise heart rate achieved (65 to 80 percent), and rating of perceived exertion (11 to 16 on a 6-to-20 RPE scale). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;, section on 'Exercise training'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximal heart rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maximal heart rate can be estimated by the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160;Maximal heart rate = 220 - age (in years)</p></div></div><p>It must be recognized that the standard deviation for this equation is 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span>. Given that this calculation was derived by studies in men, another study determined that the above formula overestimates the maximum heart rate in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Therefore, it is most accurate to directly measure the maximal heart rate at highest exercise intensity on the maximal exercise test, particularly in cardiac patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;, section on 'Test endpoints'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Peak exercise capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peak exercise capacity is defined as &quot;the maximum ability of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen to exercising skeletal muscle and of the exercising muscle to extract oxygen from the blood&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. As a result, exercise tolerance is determined by three factors: pulmonary gas exchange; cardiac performance; and skeletal muscle metabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exercise capacity can be quantitated clinically by measurement of oxygen uptake (V<sub>O2</sub>), carbon dioxide production (V<sub>CO2</sub>), and minute ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These parameters are measured during exercise with rapidly responding gas analyzers capable of breath-by-breath determination of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The maximal oxygen uptake (V<sub>O2</sub>max) eventually reaches a plateau despite increasing workload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62094 \">figure 2</a>). Not surprisingly, V<sub>O2</sub>max has a strong linear correlation with heart rate, cardiac output, and skeletal muscle blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63482%7ECARD%2F65079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63482 graphicRef65079 \">figure 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>It is convenient to express oxygen uptake in multiples of resting requirement. The <strong>metabolic equivalent</strong> (MET) is a unit of resting oxygen uptake. Rather than using each patient's own value, one MET is designated as the average value (3.5 mL O<sub>2</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">uptake/kg</span> per min). Maximum values occur between age 15 and 30 and then progressively decrease with age; however, they can be increased with aerobic exercise training. Values of approximately 12 METs are seen with maximal exercise in moderately active young men, while distance runners can have values as high as 18 to 24 METs. A mean exercise capacity of 10 METs has been observed in nonathletic, healthy, middle-aged men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaerobic threshold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anaerobic threshold (AT) is another index used to estimate exercise capacity. It is defined as the point at which minute ventilation increases disproportionately relative to V<sub>O2</sub>, a response that is generally seen at 60 to 70 percent of V<sub>O2</sub>max (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62094 \">figure 2</a>). The AT is a reflection of the increase in lactic acid production by working muscles. It can be used to distinguish between noncardiac (pulmonary or musculoskeletal) and cardiac causes of exercise limitation, since patients who fatigue prior to reaching AT are likely to have a noncardiac problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-assessment-and-measurement-of-exercise-capacity-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. If the AT occurs at less than 40 percent of predicted V<sub>O2</sub>max, it is taken as evidence of cardiovascular impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systolic BP increases linearly with work rate to approximately 200 mmHg in normotensives and higher in hypertensives. The diastolic BP does not change with work rate in normotensives but does increase in hypertensives. A fall in systolic BP with rising work rate may be due to aortic valve obstruction, impaired left ventricular function, or global myocardial ischemia. The blood pressure should be allowed to decrease gradually following exercise. A cool-down period of a low-exercise workload is necessary to prevent postexercise hypotension due to excessive venous pooling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Rating of perceived exertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rating of perceived exertion (RPE or Borg scale) is a subjective measure of exercise intensity and is a good indicator of relative fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 3</a>). It can be used in conjunction with the heart rate to determine the consistency of effort from one study to the next in a given patient. The RPE can also be used by the unsupervised patient to control the intensity of exercise. An alternative in elderly patients is the &quot;talk test&quot;; patients are instructed to exercise only to an intensity that permits them to continue talking to an exercising companion.
