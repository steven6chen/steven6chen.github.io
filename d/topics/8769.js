One proposed major reason for the increased incidence of preterm birth is the higher rate of multiple gestations, in part due to assisted reproductive technology (ART). Infants of multiple gestation are prone to delivery early; half of all twin births and &gt;90 percent of triplets are born preterm. In 2015, the rate of twin births and higher-order multiple births were 33.5 and 0.1 per 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The risk of death increases with increasing immaturity (ie, decreasing birth weight [BW] and gestational age [GA]). For example, in the yearly analysis from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which links all births and infant deaths (through the first year of age) in the United States, BW less than 500 g was associated with a mortality rate of 85 percent within the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. LBW is the most common risk factor for mortality around the world among children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Factors that cause variation in preterm mortality rates include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of prematurity &ndash; Mortality rises with increasing immaturity (ie, decreasing BW and GA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal ethnicity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of neonatal care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital anomalies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational age and birth weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality rates amongst preterm infants correlate with BW and GA, with decreases in both associated with poorer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. Thus, infants born with the lowest GA and BW have the largest impact on infant mortality because they have the greatest risk of death. As an example, although infants who weigh less than 1000 g account for only 0.8 percent of births in the United States, they accounted for 55 percent of all infants deaths in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In 2013, infant mortality rates per 1000 live births in the United States based upon BW were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;2500 g &ndash; 2.1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2000 to 2499 &ndash; 9.9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1500 to 1999 &ndash; 24.7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1250 to 1499 &ndash; 39.9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1000 to 1249 &ndash; 61.7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>750 to 999 g &ndash; 124.6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>500 to 749 g &ndash; 394.3</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&lt;500 g &ndash; 853</p><p/><p>A similar relationship with increasing mortality rates per 1000 live births and decreasing GA was also noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>40 weeks GA &ndash; 1.75</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>37 to 39 weeks GA &ndash; 2.41</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>34 to 36 weeks GA &ndash; 7.23</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>32 to 33 weeks GA &ndash; 16.02</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>28 to 31 weeks GA &ndash; 35.7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 28 weeks &ndash; 374.74</p><p/><p>Risk factors for death or severe neurosensory impairment in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) and LBW infants (BW &lt;1500 g) include bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), brain injury, severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and infection (eg, meningitis, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In addition, ELBW infants who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the delivery room have increased risk of mortality or severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in survivors than those who did not receive CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In a systematic review, pooled data from studies conducted in Latin America, Africa, and Asia report that preterm infants (GA less than 37 weeks) had a 6.8-fold increase in neonatal death compared with term infants (relative risk [RR] 6.82, 95% CI 3.56-13.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Overall, more than two-thirds of infant deaths occur during the neonatal period defined as less than 28 days of age. The risk of dying within this neonatal period increases with decreasing GA. In addition, lower BW due to fetal growth restriction (FGR) increase mortality at a given GA in preterm infants born at or below 31 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In this analysis that compared mortality across three time periods (2000 to 2003, 2004 to 2007, and 2008 to 2011), mortality was lowest in the third time period (2008 to 2011) due to decreased rates of deaths related to pulmonary causes (neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [RDS] and BPD), immaturity, infection, and central nervous system injury. In contrast, the incidence of deaths due to NEC was lowest in the earliest time period (2000 to 2003), and deaths due to congenital anomalies remained constant through all three study periods. Overall, 40 percent of deaths occurred within 12 hours after birth, most frequently due to immaturity, as deaths were mainly in infants born at 22 or 23 weeks gestation. RDS was the most common cause of death in infants born at 24 to 27 weeks of gestation, and the majority of deaths occurred from after 12 hours to 28 days of life.
