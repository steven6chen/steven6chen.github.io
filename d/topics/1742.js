Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, although many women are asymptomatic. Of those women with symptoms, abnormal vaginal discharge and fishy odor are typical.</p><p>This topic will present the treatment options for various groups of women with bacterial vaginosis. Related topics on the presentation and diagnosis of BV, the approach to the woman with vaginitis, and cervicitis are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial vaginosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2649853388\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is indicated for relief of symptoms in women with symptomatic infection and to prevent postoperative infection in those with asymptomatic infection prior to abortion or hysterectomy. Of note, BV resolves spontaneously in up to one-third of nonpregnant and one-half of pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3828693683\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15967700\" class=\"local\">'Women undergoing gynecologic procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3043226285\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment of BV may also reduce the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. For this reason, some experts support the concept of treating all women with BV regardless of presence or absence of symptoms; however, we agree with recommendations to not treat asymptomatic women who are not pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Asymptomatic pregnant women with previous preterm births may benefit from treatment, but screening and treatment of these women is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H3043226285\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p>The following treatment recommendations are consistent with those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Guidelines from other organizations are available elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964546720\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPREGNANT WOMEN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3828693683\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2294554064\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of symptomatic non-pregnant women with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> administered either orally or intravaginally results in a high rate of clinical cure (70 to 80 percent at four weeks of follow-up) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77648 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. As treatment efficacy is similar between metronidazole and clindamycin, regardless of delivery route, the choice of medication is based on availability, patient preference, side effects, and cost. Oral medication is more convenient, but associated with a higher rate of systemic side effects, such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and <em>Clostridium difficile</em> associated diarrhea, than vaginal administration. If neither metronidazole nor clindamycin are available, either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secnidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secnidazole</a> are reasonable oral alternatives. No new drugs have been introduced for BV therapy in the past decade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1418366867\"><span class=\"h3\">Metronidazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> has been established in randomized trials using either placebo or active drug controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The oral regimen we recommend is 500 mg twice daily for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Treatment with a single oral dose of 2 grams of metronidazole has lower efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and is no longer recommended for treatment of BV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Alcohol should not be consumed during therapy and for one day after completion of therapy (for oral or vaginal therapy).</p><p>Similar to oral therapy, there are single and multiday dosing options for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> vaginal gel for the treatment of BV. The multiday vaginal gel has similar efficacy to seven days of oral metronidazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. While the single-dose treatment is superior to placebo gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], it is not known if the single-day dose is as efficacious as the multiday oral or vaginal treatments, and therefore we prefer the multiday treatment. Multiday vaginal therapy consists of 0.75 percent metronidazole inserted as 5 grams of gel once daily for five days (5 grams of gel contains 37.5 mg of metronidazole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>]. The single-dose vaginal gel contains 65 mg of metronidazole in an applicator pre-filled with 5 grams of gel and is inserted at bedtime. The choice of oral versus vaginal therapy should depend upon patient preference.</p><p>There is little evidence of benefit from prolonging therapy longer than seven days. Most comparative studies using divided-dose oral regimens for one week achieved early cure rates in excess of 90 percent, and cure rates (by Amsel criteria) at four weeks of approximately 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/12,14,17,18,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,17,18,22-24</a>]. Although early cure rates are significantly higher when the initial course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> therapy is 14 days rather than seven days, long-term cure rates (21 days after completion of therapy) are similar for both treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Published cure rates vary widely according to the investigators' diagnostic criteria, definition of cure and treatment failure, and length of time post-therapy before the follow-up visit.</p><p>Side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (oral or vaginal) include a metallic taste, nausea (in 10 percent of patients), transient neutropenia (7.5 percent), a disulfiram-like effect with alcohol, prolongation of International Normalized Ratio in patients taking vitamin K antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>), and peripheral neuropathy. Gastrointestinal side effects are less common with vaginal administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Allergy to metronidazole is uncommon; it manifests as rash, urticaria, pruritus, and, rarely, anaphylaxis, which can be successfully treated by oral desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3205511435\"><span class=\"h3\">Clindamycin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of randomized trials, both comparative and placebo-controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The preferred regimen is a seven-day course of 2 percent clindamycin cream vaginally (5 grams of cream containing 100 mg of clindamycin phosphate), but may be less effective than the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> regimens; nevertheless, vaginal clindamycin cream is a reasonable therapeutic choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Alternative regimens include oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (300 mg twice daily for seven days) or clindamycin ovules (100 mg intravaginally once daily for three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>]. A one-day or single application of clindamycin as a bioadhesive is another option (Clindesse). These regimens have not been studied extensively and may have lower efficacy for eradicating BV.</p><p>Intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> therapy has been associated with an increased prevalence of clindamycin-resistant anaerobic bacteria in the vagina post-treatment (17 percent of bacterial isolates before versus 53 percent of isolates after therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This effect persisted in most women for at least 90 days after clindamycin treatment. In contrast, increased resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> was not observed in women treated with that drug. Further investigation is required to determine the clinical implications of these findings.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> cream should not be used concurrently with latex condoms, which may be weakened.</p><p>Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with both oral and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190002614\"><span class=\"h3\">Tinidazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tinidazole</a> is a second-generation nitroimidazole that is considered an alternative regimen if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> are unavailable or not tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12 to 14 hours versus 6 to 7 hours) and fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but is more costly since no generic formulation is available. If used, we suggest 1 gram orally once daily for five days, as efficacy is slightly higher and side effects are slightly less frequent than with shorter course therapy (tinidazole 2 grams orally daily for two days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Randomized trials have shown that it is at least as effective as metronidazole, but not superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>], and a single-dose regimen appears to be as effective as vaginal clindamycin cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H872658162\"><span class=\"h3\">Secnidazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secnidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Secnidazole</a> is a nitroimidazole antibiotic with a longer half-life than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (approximately 17 hours versus 8 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a randomized double-blind non-inferiority trial, a single 2 gram oral dose of secnidazole was at least as effective as a seven-day course of 500 mg metronidazole administered orally twice daily, and was well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a phase-3 trial comparing a single 2 gram dose of oral secnidazole with placebo, single-dose secnidazole was superior to placebo, with clinical outcome responder rates of 53 versus 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A single 1 gram oral dose of secnidazole appears to be effective as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Although compliance is enhanced by the convenience of a single-dose regimen, there is no evidence demonstrating that single-dose secnidazole is superior to multidose metronidazole therapy, which typically is much less expensive. While previously available in other countries, secnidazole was approved for the treatment of BV by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H795806636\"><span class=\"h3\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probiotics (live microorganisms which confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts) have been used alone and as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics for treatment of BV and prevention of relapse. Systemic reviews of trials of probiotics for treatment of BV have not found sufficient evidence for or against efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Although some trials have reported very promising results, we feel the results should be reproduced in more well-designed and larger trials before use of this therapy is considered. In addition, further investigation is needed to determine the optimum route of administration (oral or vaginal), which strains or combination of strains are most effective (eg, <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </em>GR-1, <em>Lactobacillus reuteri</em> RC-14, <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>), and the dose and duration of use. The regulatory oversight and quality of commercially available probiotics varies worldwide. In the United States, the content of these products is not standardized and often of poor quality. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises caution in using dietary supplements containing live bacteria or yeast in immunocompromised patients, as patient death has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3250916518\"><span class=\"h3\">Less effective and ineffective therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triple-sulfa creams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, lactic acid gel, acetic acid gel, ascorbic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, hydrogen peroxide, and povidone-iodine vaginal douches are significantly less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/25,44-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,44-50</a>].

This practice is supported by a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 54 women with asymptomatic BV who were randomly assigned to receive intravaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or placebo gel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There was no difference in the proportion of women in either group who noticed improvement in vaginal odor or discharge. In addition, 6 of 28 women receiving metronidazole developed symptomatic vaginal candidiasis compared with no women taking placebo.</p><p>Although some experts recommend treatment of asymptomatic BV because affected women are more susceptible to acquiring other sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV and herpes simplex virus), available evidence is insufficient to clearly support or exclude a benefit of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/6,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,51-53</a>].</p><p>Treatment is indicated for asymptomatic women who are scheduled for certain gynecologic procedures (see below).

Other complications of BV include postpartum endometritis (odds ratio [OR] 2.53, 95% CI 1.25-5.08), and an increased risk of late miscarriage (OR 6.32, 95% CI 3.65-10.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Despite the association between BV and adverse outcome, screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV during pregnancy is controversial.

Three trials showed fewer deliveries before 37 weeks of gestation with treatment, one showed no benefit, and one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>] reported an increase in preterm deliveries after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>. For delivery before 34 weeks of gestation, meta-analysis was possible and showed no significant treatment benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2011 meta-analysis of five randomized trials of asymptomatic women with BV at &lt;22 weeks of gestation treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> or <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/no</span> treatment, clindamycin therapy was associated with a reduction in preterm birth &lt;37 weeks (3.7 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[44/1183]</span> versus 6.2 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[72/1163];</span> fixed effects relative risk [RR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.86, random effects 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-1.05) and late miscarriage (0.3 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[2/639]</span> versus 1.9 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">[12/631];</span> RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Subgroup analysis revealed that oral, not vaginal, clindamycin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in preterm birth (oral therapy RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20-0.76; vaginal RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.47-1.14). The analysis included a mixed population of women at both low and high risk of preterm birth.</p><p/><p>Based upon these data, we agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF, CDC, and Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommendations to not routinely screen and treat all pregnant women with asymptomatic BV to prevent preterm birth and its consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7,68,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,68,72,73</a>]. It is not possible to define specific features characterizing a subgroup of women who might respond favorably to a screening and treatment protocol. Defining these features is an active area of investigation.</p><p>As illustrated above, there may be benefits to early screening and treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women who have a history of a previous preterm delivery, but there are insufficient data to recommend this as a routine practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/56,74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,74-77</a>]. Further definition of high-risk subgroups is under investigation. As an example, women with polymorphisms of genes regulating cytokine production (eg, tumor necrosis factor variants) have a greater proinflammatory immune response to infectious stimuli, such as BV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Enhanced induction of cytokines in these women could then lead to preterm labor or rupture of membranes. Other aspects of host response (eg, low levels of immunoglobulin A [IgA] to <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>) or the specific types of BV associated bacteria involved (eg, bacteria that produce high levels of sialidase or protease) may also play a role in placing some women with BV at high risk of preterm birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction#H1613249247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction#H1559370150\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p>When treatment of BV is initiated, the optimal choice of antibiotic, timing of therapy, duration of use, and harms of therapy are also controversial. The first trials demonstrated a reduction in preterm birth in high-risk women treated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or oral metronidazole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60950\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60950 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

This association requires further investigation and confirmation before avoiding metronidazole for treatment of BV in pregnancy. Other trials suggest that oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> given early in pregnancy is an effective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>] and that topical clindamycin given in the second half of pregnancy is less effective and even associated with an increase in low birth weight and neonatal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Therefore, we use oral therapy when treatment is indicated, and consider both metronidazole and clindamycin acceptable choices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1041790684\"><span class=\"h1\">BREASTFEEDING WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat women with symptomatic BV who are breastfeeding. Of note, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breastfed infant's gastrointestinal flora so the infant should be monitored for diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or, rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Infant side effects are less likely with vaginal than oral use since only approximately 30 percent of a vaginal dose is absorbed.</p><p>When indicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> is used for treatment of infection in neonates. There are no human data supporting an association between metronidazole use and cancer; however, an association with carcinogenesis in rodents has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Outcomes data of maternal metronidazole use did not show a significant increase in adverse events compared to use of other antimicrobials, although a cohort study found a nonsignificant trend toward more loose stools and more candidal colonization in metronidazole-exposed infants. Since the relative infant dose of metronidazole is high (29 percent) with maternal administration of the 2 gram one-time dose, a cautious approach for mothers receiving this dose is to express and discard their milk for 12 to 24 hours. This recommendation has not been extended to other metronidazole regimens.</p><p>Use of vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> has not been studied during breastfeeding. After vaginal administration, plasma levels are less than 2 percent of those after a 500 mg oral dose, so vaginal use of metronidazole during breastfeeding is unlikely to be of concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>For lactating women who are administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secnidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secnidazole</a>, interruption of breastfeeding is recommended during treatment and for three days after the last dose based on animal data (tinidazole only) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15967700\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN UNDERGOING GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence linking asymptomatic BV with gynecologic complications has caused this issue to be reassessed, especially with the availability of topical therapy. It is reasonable to treat asymptomatic BV prior to hysterectomy and before pregnancy termination to prevent postprocedure infection (cuff infection after hysterectomy, endometritis after abortion). Reported reductions in postoperative infectious complications range from 10 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/82-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-88</a>].

In a 2016 meta-analysis of seven trials assessing efficacy of BV treatment versus placebo in women and their male sexual partners, antibiotic treatment did not increase the rate of clinical or symptomatic improvement nor did it reduce the rate of recurrence during a four week study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The men in the treatment group reported more adverse events compared with men in the placebo group. For women who have sex with women, women with BV should encourage their female partners to be aware of the signs and symptoms of BV, given the high risk of concordant infection (25 to 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. While treatment of confirmed infection is indicated for relief of symptoms, the available data do not support treatment of asymptomatic sexual partners.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male partners &ndash; It is not necessary to treat male sexual partners of affected women, as there is no strong evidence that the woman's response to therapy and risk of relapse are influenced by treatment of her male sex partner(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,92</a>].

Some studies have reported reduced rates of recurrence when male sexual partners used condoms routinely during coitus or when women remained abstinent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/25,94-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,94-98</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female partners &ndash; Women with BV who have sex with women (WSW) should encourage their partners to be aware of the signs and symptoms of BV, given the high risk of concordant infection (25 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]). In women with confirmed infection, treatment is indicated for relief of symptoms. It has been hypothesized that behavioral interventions that reduce transfer of vaginal fluid between female sex partners may be helpful (eg, cleaning sex toys between use, use of gloves during digital-vaginal sex); however, a small randomized trial evaluating this approach reported no reduction in BV persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

The explanation for this high rate of recurrence is unclear. Reinfection is possible, but recurrence more likely reflects a failure to eradicate the offending organisms or to reestablish the normal protective vaginal flora dominated by lactobacillus. Infections involving biofilms can be more difficult to eradicate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. The only interventions proven to reduce development or recurrence of BV are chronic suppressive therapy and circumcision of male partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment &ndash; Limited data are available regarding the optimal treatment strategy for women with recurrent BV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. We suggest symptomatic relapse be treated initially with a seven-day course of oral or vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>.

We believe any patient with more than three documented episodes of BV in the previous 12 months should be offered a long-term maintenance regimen consisting of maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> vaginal gel. Long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> regimens, oral or topical, are not advised because of toxicity (oral) and lack of documented efficacy (topical) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Accordingly, if any of the aforementioned antimicrobials fail, we prescribe metronidazole gel 0.75 percent or an oral nitroimidazole for 7 to 10 days followed by twice weekly dosing of gel for four to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one multicenter prospective trial of this metronidazole gel regimen, recurrent BV occurred in 25.5 percent of patients on suppressive therapy versus 59.1 percent of those receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Secondary vaginal candidiasis was a common side effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although supporting data are lacking, women with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> allergy can be treated with either topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> gel or undergo metronidazole desensitization. As noted above, topical clindamycin gel (2%) is less effective, which is why metronidazole gel is preferred. In our experience, clindamycin therapy is frequently associated with vaginal yeast coinfections compared with metronidazole gel. Clindamycin should not be used in women with a history of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Results can be improved by adding vaginal boric acid to the oral nitroimidazole induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> is taken orally for seven days; vaginal boric acid 600 mg once daily at bedtime is begun at the same time and continued for 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-vaginosis-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients are seen for follow-up a day or two after their last boric acid dose; if they are in remission, we immediately begin metronidazole gel twice weekly for four to six months as suppressive therapy.
