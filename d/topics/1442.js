One study reported that <span class=\"nowrap\">DR3-DQ2/DRB1*04:01-DQ8</span> is a susceptibility genotype for T1DM with autoimmune thyroiditis, while DRB1*11:01-DQA1*05:05-DQB1*03:01 and DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 genotypes are protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Subclinical hypothyroidism in patients with T1DM can be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and reduced linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In general, TSH should be tested several weeks after the diagnosis of T1DM, when metabolic control has been established. This is because at least 20 percent of patients will have transient abnormalities of thyroid function when T1DM is first diagnosed, which resolve as the diabetes is treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests that antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin be measured at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Most cases of celiac disease (up to 79 percent in one study) are diagnosed within five years of diabetes onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>These prevalence rates appear to be the same in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Asia, although one study from Sweden has reported a higher prevalence rate of 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the Swedish study, 62 percent of those diagnosed with celiac disease following onset of T1DM had positive celiac-specific antibodies within 24 months of diagnosis of T1DM. One study also reported a higher five-year cumulative incidence of celiac disease in Finland compared with neighboring Estonia (0.77 versus 0.27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors for celiac disease include female gender, younger age of onset and longer duration of T1DM, and the presence of thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27-29</a>]. The study cited above suggests that early life sequential infections may increase the risk of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The genetic susceptibility to celiac disease and T1DM has been attributed to specific shared alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], with HLA-DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 haplotypes increasing the risk, and the DQB1*06:02 allele being protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Only a minority of children with T1DM and celiac disease present with gastrointestinal symptoms of food intolerance, food avoidance, gastrointestinal discomfort, and diarrhea. More common initial findings include unpredictable blood glucose measurements, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, poor glycemic control, and growth failure because of erratic intestinal absorption of nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>].

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are lower in children with T1DM and celiac disease at diagnosis than in those without celiac disease, and increase following implementation of the gluten-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Celiac screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the prevalence of celiac disease and its potential clinical impact on patients with T1DM, all children with T1DM should be screened for celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97226\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97226 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Because these tests are based upon immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, a quantitative serum IgA level should also be obtained during the screening process to ensure that levels are not falsely low due to IgA deficiency. In patients with IgA deficiency, screening may be performed by measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG)-deamidated gliadin peptides. Testing for HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">DQ2/DQ8</span> to determine genetic susceptibility to celiac disease generally is not helpful because a high proportion of individuals with T1DM also carry these risk alleles, so a positive result is not revealing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the screening test is positive, the patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for confirmatory small bowel biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the small bowel biopsy confirms celiac disease, the patient should be placed on a gluten-free diet. Nutritional counseling should be provided by a registered dietitian who has experience in caring for patients with both diabetes and celiac disease. Because gluten-free dietary substitutes are often high in carbohydrate content, identifying gluten-free products with acceptable carbohydrate content is essential for successful management of these patients.

More frequent screening is appropriate for children who develop symptoms suggestive of celiac disease (gastrointestinal symptoms, poor growth or weight loss), or for those who have a first-degree relative with celiac disease.
