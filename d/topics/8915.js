In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), inhaled NO has an established role in vasoreactivity testing. Inhaled NO has also been proposed as a long-term therapy for PAH and possibly other types of pulmonary hypertension (PH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and is occasionally used as a rescue therapy for severely hypoxemic patients both with and without an established diagnosis of PH. </p><p>The role of inhaled NO in vasoreactivity testing and therapeutic uses of this agent in adults are discussed in this topic review. The use of inhaled NO in the management of infants with persistent PH and the role of <strong>exhaled</strong> NO as a marker of disease activity in asthma and other chronic lung diseases are discussed separately.

With the help of several key cofactors, NOS catalyzes a multi-step reaction in which L-arginine and oxygen are converted to L-citrulline and NO. NO that is synthesized by vascular endothelial cells diffuses into adjacent vascular smooth muscle and decreases vascular tone in the systemic and pulmonary circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. When administered by inhalation, it selectively dilates pulmonary vasculature in ventilated areas of the lung. The vasodilating effect of inhaled NO has a rapid onset of action and a short half-life that results in essentially no effect on systemic vessels making it a highly selective, short acting pulmonary vasodilator and an ideal agent for pulmonary vasoreactivity testing. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Vasoreactivity testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanism of action</strong> &ndash; NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which then activates cGMP dependent protein kinase (PKG) which results in the activation of several regulatory mechanisms that decrease intracellular calcium and decrease vascular smooth muscle tone (ie, vasodilation) in precapillary resistance arterioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Additional effects of NO include suppression of both smooth muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These properties have led to the development of inhaled NO and other agents that enhance the <span class=\"nowrap\">NO/cGMP</span> signaling pathway such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a> (phosphodiesterase type-5 [PDE5] inhibitors), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=riociguat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">riociguat</a>, an sGC stimulator. Inhaled NO has been shown to be effective at reducing pulmonary vascular resistance at doses as low as 1 part per million (ppm). A vasodilator effect of NO has been demonstrated with as little as 0.1 ppm and there appears to be a threshold for pulmonary vasodilation that occurs at a dose of approximately 10 ppm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

NO is also rapidly oxidized to the more stable metabolites nitrite dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>-) and nitrite trioxide (NO<sub>3</sub>-). While the half-life of newly formed NO is in the order of 0.1 to 5 seconds, the vasodilator effect of the <span class=\"nowrap\">cGMP/PKG</span> signaling induced by inhaled NO has a half-life of 15 to 30 seconds at a dose of 5 to 80 ppm. Due to its rapid inactivation and metabolism, inhaled NO selectively impacts the pulmonary vasculature with little systemic dissemination, which in contrast to other therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension, makes it an attractive candidate as a &quot;pure&quot; pulmonary vasodilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The pulmonary hypertensive diseases have been classified into five groups by the World Health Organization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>). Group 1 includes those diseases that cause PH by obliterative vascular remodeling of the distal pulmonary circulation and are collectively referred to as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Groups 2-5 include diseases that elevate pulmonary arterial pressure due to left heart, lung, thromboembolic, and miscellaneous diseases, respectively. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> (NO) in PH mostly applies to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; ie, group 1 PAH).

Vasoreactivity testing identifies a minority of patients (less than 10 percent) in whom PAH is due primarily to increased pulmonary vascular tone as opposed to pulmonary vascular remodeling. These patients have a much more favorable prognosis and respond well to treatment with high dose calcium channel blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>), agents considered to have a lower cost and toxicity profile when compared with other available advanced therapies for PAH. Vasoreactivity testing involves the administration of a short-acting vasodilator followed by measurement of the hemodynamic response during right heart catheterization that identifies this population.</p><p>Details regarding the procedure and efficacy of inhaled NO in vasoreactivity testing are discussed in this section.

Although no single agent has been established as superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], NO is typically used since its effect on the pulmonary vasculature is highly selective and systemic effects minimal due to its short half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/3,9,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,13-16</a>].

In patients with PAH, there does not appear to be any significant difference in vasodilator response between 20 and 40 ppm. Therefore, most PH centers of expertise usually do not use doses in excess of this range.</p><p>While vasoreactivity testing with inhaled NO (or any other agent) identifies patients who are vasoreactive, the results of testing do not reliably predict whether patients will experience clinical improvement in symptoms with calcium channel blockade.

Randomized trials using enhanced delivery systems offer some promise. </p><p>The rationale for the use of inhaled NO (and other inhaled agents) in PAH is local delivery of a potent pulmonary vasodilator with minimal systemic effects. In addition, it is thought that administration of a vasodilator by the inhaled route will result in preferential pulmonary vasodilation in areas of well-ventilated lung, resulting in improvement in ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> matching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56760 \">figure 1</a>); this is in contrast to worsening <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatching that can result from a generalized increase in pulmonary flow to both poorly ventilated and well ventilated alveoli with systemically administered agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While in the past, enthusiasm for inhaled NO reflected these potential effects and a lack of alternative therapy, excitement has waned due to practical difficulties with its administration and the development of effective alternative systemic therapies with proven benefit, which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inhaled NO has been successfully administered continuously to patients with PAH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>) (ie, outpatients) via nasal prongs, or face mask, regardless of whether a rapid vasodilatory response occurs. However, while hemodynamics (eg, mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance) and exercise tolerance improve with inhaled NO, the effect is not consistent and the potential impact of long-term NO treatment on survival is unstudied. Evidence supporting its use is limited to case reports and small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In one case report, prolonged inhaled NO was used successfully as a bridge to transplantation in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Enhanced delivery systems offer promise of therapeutic potential for inhaled NO in this population. The results of a randomized clinical trial evaluating a pulsed, inhaled delivery system for long-term NO treatment in patients with PAH are awaited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

However, inhaled NO usually has a small effect on <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> and a larger effect on reducing shunt fraction. This is thought to occur because small increases in perfusion to areas of normal ventilation result in a &ldquo;steal&rdquo; phenomenon from areas that are perfused but not ventilated, thereby reducing intra-pulmonary shunt. It is prudent when selecting inhaled NO in these settings that it is estimated by the prescribing physician that vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vascular bed or intrapulmonary shunting is contributing to severe <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoxemia/hemodynamic</span> compromise. </p><p>Evidence to support use in this population are limited and of poor quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/27,28,31,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,31,36,37</a>].

Not all facilities have NO on their formulary due to its high cost but it is more likely to be available in institutions that use it frequently in infants with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension, where its therapeutic role is established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.) </p><p>When administered for more than several days, inhaled NO should not be abruptly discontinued, but rather weaned slowly by gradually decreasing the dose in decrements of 10 parts per million (ppm) over several days. Once a dose of 10 ppm is reached, discontinuation is generally considered safe, although an increase in FiO<sub>2</sub> may temporarily be required.

In a study of 31 patients treated with inhaled NO for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, approximately 25 percent had hemodynamic collapse when the NO was abruptly discontinued after 10 to 30 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Some evidence suggests that coadministration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> may ameliorate the effects of withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Slow weaning over days is preferred when discontinuing this agent.</p><p/><p>Inhaled NO may also have some theoretical adverse effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytotoxicity</strong> &ndash; NO and its oxidized derivatives (principally NO<sub>2</sub>) can be directly toxic to alveolar and vascular tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>]. NO should be stored in combination with nitrogen (at concentrations no higher than 1000 ppm) and blended with oxygen at the time of administration, in order to prevent oxidation to toxic products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. In addition, there should be close surveillance for NO<sub>2</sub> levels &gt;2 ppm (usually performed by institutional environmental health departments by means of a detector device). Only some commercial administration systems measure NO<sub>2</sub> levels. The formation of NO<sub>2</sub> increases exponentially with the concentration of oxygen used. We measure NO<sub>2</sub> levels continuously when NO is used with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) greater than 0.5. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">NO released into the work environment can be potentially toxic. The limit of NO exposure for employees set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is <strong>25 ppm</strong> as an 8-hour time-weighted average. This degree of exposure would be unlikely to occur by the accumulation of exhaled NO in a patient&rsquo;s room. However, it is recommended that patients receiving prolonged inhaled NO through a ventilator circuit have their expiratory gases ventilated to the outside environment or, if administered by nasal prongs or face mask, that it be done in a well ventilated area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunosuppression</strong> &ndash; NO has immunosuppressive properties, which theoretically could increase the risk of nosocomial infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mutagenesis</strong> &ndash; Potentially mutagenic DNA strand breaks and base alterations can be caused by NO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal dysfunction</strong> &ndash; NO may increase the risk of renal dysfunction, especially with prolonged use and in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitric oxide</a> (NO) is a naturally occurring vasodilator. It selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature when administered by inhalation. Its action is rapid in onset and effects are short-lived due to its short half-life (15 to 30 seconds). Inhaled NO is generally administered by mixing pressurized NO and oxygen and adjusting the amount of NO using bleeder valves. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Biology and pharmacokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute vasodilator testing is the only well established and widely accepted use of NO in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Vasoreactivity testing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H244329771\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Vasoreactivity test'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous, prolonged inhaled NO is not accepted as a first-line agent for long-term treatment of PAH because of logistical challenges in its delivery, limited data regarding its safety and efficacy, and the availability of other agents. Occasionally, it has been used successfully to stabilize acutely ill <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamically compromised patients with severe underlying pulmonary hypertension (PH), and less commonly improve hypoxemia in those without pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H818847353\" class=\"local\">'Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled NO is generally considered safe. Adverse effects include hemodynamic compromise, methemoglobinemia, and rebound pulmonary hypertension (when discontinued after prolonged administration). There are other theoretical adverse effects including cytotoxicity, immunosuppression, and mutagenesis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4178354306\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Darren Taichman, MD, PhD who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01457781 (Accessed on August 24, 2015).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gaston B, Drazen JM, Loscalzo J, Stamler JS.
