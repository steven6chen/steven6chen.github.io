This means the lung does not blow up to its normal size with each breath. It can happen if something presses on the lung or blocks the air flow inside it. It can also happen if something gets stuck in the tubes that carry air to the lungs and inside the lungs. Doctors call these tubes &quot;airways.&quot;</p><p>Atelectasis can cause breathing problems. A person with atelectasis might not get enough oxygen in his or her blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14886598\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of atelectasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atelectasis does not always cause symptoms. If it does, the symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems &ndash; A person with atelectasis might struggle to breathe. He or she might not be able to take a deep breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin or lips that look blue &ndash; This can be a sign of not getting enough oxygen in the blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14886613\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for atelectasis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and chest X-ray. This can show if part or all of a lung has collapsed. It can also show which part of the lung and how much of it collapsed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14886628\"><span class=\"h1\">How is atelectasis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines and other treatments for pneumonia or any other disease that is causing the atelectasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments to break up mucus in the lungs and get it out, if mucus is blocking the air flow &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines &ndash; Some medicines can be taken as pills, and others can be given with an inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Airway clearance therapy &ndash; This can help atelectasis caused by mucus stuck in the lungs. It is sometimes called &quot;chest physiotherapy.&quot; There is more than one way to do this. For example, a physical therapist might thump the back to loosen mucus. Other ways involve using special devices. These include a vibrating bed, a vibrating vest, and devices a person can breathe into.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Devices to help a person cough</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sucking mucus out of the airway</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other treatments. These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oxygen &ndash; Given through a mask over the face or a tube into the nose </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Devices to help open the airway and lung &ndash; A person can wear a device that keeps the airway open called a &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; (CPAP) machine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery &ndash; If atelectasis is caused by something pressing on the lungs, such as a tumor or cyst, doctors can do surgery to take it out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14886643\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-collapsed-lung-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
