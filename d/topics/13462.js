PVL is the major form of brain white matter injury that affects premature infants, and is associated with the subsequent development of cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment, and visual disturbances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, diagnosis, and management of PVL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lesions of PVL were described more than 100 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Parrot recognized the periventricular lesions as infarcts called &quot;cerebral st&eacute;atose&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Banker and Larroche used the term &quot;periventricular leukomalacia,&quot; described the neuropathological changes that corresponded to coagulation necrosis, and defined the clinicopathological correlations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVL is more common in premature than term infants, and occurs more frequently with decreasing gestational age and size. The greatest period of risk for PVL is under 32 weeks of gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. PVL also occurs in late preterm and term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the United States, infants born at less than 32 weeks account for about 2 percent of all live births, and very low-birth-weight infants (&lt;1500 g) account for about 1 percent of all live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence and mortality of the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of PVL varies among centers and between survivors and nonsurvivors. The use of different ultrasonographic criteria (eg, echodensities or echolucencies) or MRI criteria contributes to this variability.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of PVL based upon ultrasonographic findings ranges from 5 to 15 percent in very low-birth-weight infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study that evaluated the outcomes in approximately 4600 infants with birth weight &lt;1500 g, PVL occurred in 6 percent of those who had sonograms at more than two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence declined from 7 to 4 percent in the smallest (501 to 750 g) to largest (1251 to 1500 g) infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of PVL based upon MRI findings is variable but generally higher than data based upon ultrasonography, as MRI is more sensitive than ultrasound for the detection of noncystic PVL in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathologic evidence of PVL is found in 25 to 75 percent of very low-birth-weight infants who die [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence increases with longer postnatal survival. Infants who survived more than six days had higher rates of PVL than those who died earlier (60 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Differences between living and autopsied infants occur in part because ultrasonography detects only overt forms of white matter injury.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal PVL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among infants with PVL who die shortly after birth, the leukomalacia may have developed prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Many fetuses who die in utero after 20 weeks gestation have ischemic lesions that are associated with placental abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental pathology in cases of neurologically impaired infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, neuroimaging studies have detected PVL in many children with mild diplegia or hemiplegia who had uneventful term deliveries and neonatal periods, suggesting that the injury occurred prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVL can be caused by ischemia or infection. Because of changes in vascular and cellular factors during development, the brain is more vulnerable to these insults in premature than term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/1,5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,18</a>].</p><p>While there are numerous animal models for prenatal and perinatal ischemic brain injuries, and while each model partially recapitulates human pathology, none of them fully mimic PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular anatomic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the developing cerebral vasculature renders the premature infant especially vulnerable to periventricular white matter injury. Incomplete development of vessels that penetrate the deep and subcortical white matter and those that supply the area near the ventricles result in a boundary zone around the ventricles with diminished vascularization. This area is therefore vulnerable to reduced flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulatory factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulatory factors that increase vulnerability to PVL include impaired cerebral vascular autoregulation and vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. Autoregulation is needed to maintain adequate cerebral blood pressure despite systemic blood pressure variation, and impairment of autoregulation can result in reduced cerebral perfusion when systemic hypotension occurs.</p><p>Causes of impaired autoregulation include asphyxia, hypoxemia, hypocarbia, hypotension, excessive handling, and multiple gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/1,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15-17</a>]. Hypoxemia and hypocarbia also cause cerebral vasoconstriction, decreasing cerebral blood flow. Prenatal circulatory disturbances can cause PVL in the fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cystic PVL, which occurs predominantly in deep white matter, necrotic changes usually affect all cell components. In contrast, the pathology in diffuse noncystic PVL predominantly affects a specific cell lineage, that of oligodendrocytes.</p><p>The following observations from cell culture, animal model, and human development studies suggest that oligodendroglial (OL) cells are a particularly susceptible target:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cell culture, differentiating preoligodendrocytes (preOLs), in contrast with astrocytes, are vulnerable to death induced by the excitatory amino acid glutamate, which increases after ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Furthermore, cultured preOLs are sensitive to the toxic effect of cystine deprivation, a form of oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a rodent model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, late preOLs but not early preOLs or mature OLs are selectively vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In developing human brains, late preOLs are the predominant form during the developmental window of vulnerability for PVL (23 to 32 gestational weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, selective cell death of late preOLs occurs in the diffuse lesion of PVL, which is mediated by oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p>Sources of the oxidative stress are attributed to cerebral ischemia and reperfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/fetal</span> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/18,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29</a>]. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the production of nitric oxide, is increased in brains with PVL, suggesting an important role of nitrosative stress in the pathology of PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Ischemic insults result in excessive extracellular levels of glutamate released from damaged axons, reactive astrocytes, and preOLs. Excessive glutamate leads to prolonged depolarization of AMPA and kainate receptors on preOLs, resulting in an influx of calcium into the cells, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Evidence of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid glutamate receptors on preOLs also suggests the presence of an alternative signaling pathway for preOL cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Axonal development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axonal maturation studies suggest that axons may be particularly susceptible to damage at a time in development that coincides with the highest risk of PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Beta amyloid precursor protein, a marker for axonal damage, has been identified in swollen axons around PVL lesions in the white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. One potential mechanism of ischemic axonal injury in PVL is that of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptor excitotoxicity. In support, a study using a cultured rat optic nerve found that damage to small premyelinated axons during oxygen-glucose deprivation required activation of NMDA receptors expressed on oligodendrocyte processes at sites of contact with the small premyelinated axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antenatal factors increase the risk of premature birth and PVL. As an example, PVL occurs more frequently in premature infants born to mothers with chorioamnionitis, premature or prolonged rupture of the membranes, bacterial vaginosis, or antepartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/11,38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,38-43</a>]. In a meta-analysis, chorioamnionitis was associated with cystic PVL (relative risk 3.0) and cerebral palsy (relative risk 1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Funisitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) or neonatal sepsis also increases the risk of PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/38,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental pathology in cases of neurologically impaired infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection may be associated with PVL because the white matter is especially susceptible to damage mediated by cytokines produced as a consequence of maternal or fetal infection, even when the infection is asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/41,43,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43,46,47</a>]. Increased cytokines activate astrocytes and microglia in the white matter, which in turn release reactive oxygen species that result in injury to preOLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a series of 94 preterm pregnancies in which amniocentesis was performed, 23 newborns had subsequent sonographic evidence of PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Median amniotic fluid concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 were higher in newborns with PVL than those without. All eight infants who later developed cerebral palsy had PVL and elevated amniotic fluid cytokine levels. In another study, overproduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was identified in the microglia of PVL lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Inflammatory cytokines also may play a role in the development of white matter damage during or after ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/41,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,47</a>]. In another study, preterm infants &le;32 weeks gestational age with genetic variation in the promoter region of the gene encoding interleukin-6 (CC genotype rather than GC or GG), possibly leading to enhanced IL-6 production, were at increased risk for PVL, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This functional polymorphism in the IL-6 gene also conveys susceptibility to cerebral palsy among term and near-term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although PVL is not considered a genetic disease, individual genetic variations, either in the maternal or fetal genome, may contribute to a susceptibility to preterm birth and white matter injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/49,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVL consists of periventricular focal necrosis, with subsequent cystic formation, and more diffuse cerebral white matter injury. Pathological changes in PVL include variable cell damage followed by cystic change, reduction in white matter, and ventriculomegaly. Ischemic injury initially results in focal necrosis with coagulative changes. These changes are followed by axonal swelling and proliferation of microglial cells, macrophages, and reactive astrocytes. The earliest microscopic changes, found within a few days, include astrocyte proliferation and microglia and macrophage accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Lesions may become cystic or hemorrhagic, with reduced white matter volume and ventriculomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical correlation with pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic changes of PVL are associated with characteristic neurologic deficits. Damage to oligodendroglial cells can impair the myelination of projection and association fibers or interfere with cortical neuronal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>The classic type of PVL with focal necrosis and cyst formation in deep white matter is more common in premature infants with gestational age between 24 to 32 weeks at birth. It is related to the development of cerebral palsy (CP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, a more diffuse cerebral white matter injury occurs in surviving smaller infants (less than 28 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Their neurologic outcome is predominated by cognitive impairment, and they are less likely to manifest the typical spastic diplegia CP syndrome at school age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>In a study of childhood survivors (mean age 5.6 years) who were born prematurely with PVL, brain MRI using volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging measurements revealed atrophy with abnormal microstructure of the thalamus when compared with 74 term control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The authors speculated that the thalamus contributes to the cognitive deficits frequently observed in children with PVL.</p><p>Infants born with a very low birth weight (&le;1500 g) are particularly prone to brain injury that involves PVL associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;neuronal/axonal</span> disease.&quot; The latter is a frequent accompaniment of PVL that is characterized by degeneration and volume loss of neurons and axons in the brainstem, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebral cortex, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The constellation of PVL and <span class=\"nowrap\">neuronal/axonal</span> disease has been termed &quot;encephalopathy of prematurity.&quot; Common sequelae include cognitive, behavioral, attentional, or socialization deficits, while cerebral palsy (major motor deficits) is a less frequent outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVL is detected in newborns by brain imaging using ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Ultrasound is the initial standard method because it is portable and least expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound findings in PVL consist of echodensities and cysts, but the criteria for diagnosis are not well defined. A standard examination includes coronal and sagittal views. In the coronal view, echodensities typically are seen adjacent to the external angles of the lateral ventricles and distributed throughout the periventricular region. In the parasagittal view, echodensities are apparent at the level of the foramen of Monro and trigone of the lateral ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].</p><p>The ultrasound findings evolve on repeated examinations. After one to three weeks, approximately one-half of the echodensities evolve into multiple small echolucent cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54442\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54442 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55257\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55257 \">image 2</a>). The cysts commonly disappear after one to three months, and ventriculomegaly results. Detection of developing PVL during the first week using power and pulse wave Doppler ultrasound to estimate fluctuations of cerebral blood flow is under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound has limited sensitivity and specificity to detect PVL, especially if the lesions are less than 0.5 cm. Sonograms may detect only 30 to 40 percent of lesions identified at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. This incidence is illustrated by a study in which ultrasound identified only 11 of 39 hemispheres with histological evidence of hypoxic ischemic injury (sensitivity 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Serial ultrasound examination and the use of brain MRI improve detection.</p><p>In addition, while serial cranial ultrasound can detect cystic PVL, it has poor sensitivity for the detection of noncystic PVL. Brain MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the detection of diffuse noncystic PVL. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>With the increasing survival rate of extremely preterm infants, the noncystic form of PVL has become important in the current neonatal care of preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine ultrasound screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A practice parameter on neuroimaging of the neonate by the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society made the following recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine ultrasound screening should be performed on all infants with a gestational age less than 30 weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening should be performed at 7 to 14 days of age and repeated at 36 to 40 weeks postmenstrual age</p><p/><p>This strategy is designed to detect clinically unsuspected intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that may influence monitoring and management, as well as PVL or ventriculomegaly, which provides information about neurodevelopmental outcome.

We recommend routine cranial ultrasonography of all infants born before 33 weeks gestation or with birth weight &lt;1500 g to identify intracranial abnormalities. Infants are screened at 7 to 14 days to detect intraventricular hemorrhage; an initial scan is obtained at three to five days in extremely low-birth-weight infants at high risk for abnormalities. PVL may not be seen on the initial scan. A sonogram performed at 4 weeks of age detects most cystic PVL and ventriculomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. We also obtain a sonogram prior to discharge.</p><p>If abnormalities are detected by ultrasonography, more frequent examinations are performed to assess the progression of PVL. In this case, MRI frequently is used for better documentation of the extent of white matter injury.

The reduced sensitivity of CT scanning is due in part to the difficulty in differentiating periventricular hypodensities from areas of hypodensity that normally are present. However, in older infants, CT can identify the loss of periventricular white matter and ventricular enlargement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technological advances have enabled MRI to be performed on preterm infants. PVL is seen as hypointense periventricular lesions on T1-weighted MRI images and as hyperintensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Such changes can be detected early in the neonatal stage, even before cystic formation becomes evident on ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>MRI can detect the same well-defined pathologic lesions seen by ultrasound, including IVH and cystic PVL, with the additional advantage of detecting more subtle abnormalities, such as noncystic diffuse white matter injuries, with higher sensitivity. This advantage of MRI is important because noncystic diffuse white matter injuries are common in extremely preterm infants. Comparative studies in preterm infants revealed that cranial ultrasound showed high reliability in the detection of cystic PVL, germinal layer hemorrhage, and IVH, but had significant limitations in the detection of noncystic PVL or diffuse white matter injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. In addition, normal echogenicity in white matter on ultrasound does not always predict normal white matter signal intensity on MRI.</p><p>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an MR technique that demonstrates motion of water in tissue and enables detection of abnormalities in white matter, providing a mechanistic insight into the imaging studies of preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/71,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,75,76</a>]. DWI enables earlier detection of PVL or white matter injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>DWI studies show that diffuse high signal intensities seen on T2-weighted MRI, whose interpretation was uncertain, likely represent oligodendrocyte or axonal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. These findings suggest that diffuse high T2 signal intensity in white matter may be a neuroradiologic correlate of the pathologic findings associated with noncystic PVL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI in older children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In older children with spastic cerebral palsy, MRI findings include increased periventricular intensity on T2-weighted scans, ventriculomegaly, a bumpy configuration of the lateral ventricles, high-intensity areas in the white matter adjacent to the trigone body of the lateral ventricles, and deep cortical sulci. These findings result from glial scarring and inadequate myelination of periventricular axons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. MRI findings in children with PVL are related to clinical outcome.

They include malformations and genetic, metabolic, and infectious insults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. For example, toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus cause periventricular necrotizing lesions accompanied by calcification. PVL must also be distinguished from periventricular hemorrhagic infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Periventricular hemorrhagic infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVL is distinct from periventricular hemorrhagic infarction, although the two may coexist in premature infants. PVL is generally symmetric and rarely hemorrhagic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In contrast, periventricular hemorrhagic infarction nearly always is unilateral or asymmetric and always is grossly hemorrhagic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The pathogenesis of this lesion is uncertain, but probably results from infarction caused by venous obstruction after a germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The circulatory disturbance is thought to occur in the subependymal region where the medullary veins drain into the terminal vein, as demonstrated by Doppler ultrasound study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>In serial imaging studies, periventricular hemorrhagic infarction evolves into a single large cyst, in contrast with the multiple small cysts seen in PVL. This large cyst usually does not disappear and may become confluent with the lateral ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The clinical correlate of hemorrhagic infarction is a spastic hemiparesis or an asymmetric spastic quadriparesis that usually is accompanied by intellectual deficits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific cure exists for PVL. Therapy is directed at teaching caregivers to handle, feed, dress, and toilet their children. Physical therapy also may prevent secondary deformities. However, a randomized controlled trial of 105 infants with abnormal cranial ultrasound scans demonstrated no benefit of early physical therapy (started before clinical abnormalities developed) compared with standard treatment (delayed physical therapy, started when abnormal physical signs became apparent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>After discharge, infants with PVL are monitored for the development of sequelae, including spastic cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment, and visual and ocular abnormalities. Parents are trained to identify and ameliorate gross and fine motor deficits and disorders of higher mental function and are supported in the care of a handicapped child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial ultrasound and brain MRI may yield prognostic information in neonates and children with PVL. In addition, a meta-analysis of 51 studies with a total of 481,753 infants found that lower umbilical cord pH is significantly associated with intraventricular hemorrhage or PVL (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 2.1-4.1) in addition to other adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial ultrasound findings and neurodevelopmental examinations in newborns correlate with later clinical outcome. Infants with more extensive white matter injury and persistent ventricular enlargement are more likely to have severe motor and cognitive deficits.</p><p>The sonographic detection of PVL with cyst formation in the neonatal period correlates with the subsequent development of cerebral palsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 12 studies, 58 percent of 272 infants with periventricular echolucency developed cerebral palsy, compared with 2.6 percent of 655 infants with normal cranial ultrasound scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Similarly, premature infants with abnormal neurodevelopmental examinations were more likely to have cerebral palsy (38 versus 6 percent) or minor neuromotor dysfunction (27 versus 13 percent) at 1 year or older, compared with infants with normal examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 127 surviving preterm infants with periventricular echodensities or cyst formation, moderate or severe periventricular echodensities with large cyst formation had a positive and negative predictive value for cerebral palsy of 90 and 93 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The contribution of periventricular echodensities without cysts to the development of neurologic sequelae is less well defined.</p><p/><p>Abnormalities confined to the germinal matrix correlate with hemorrhage and do not predict poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Another important determinant of long-term outcome is the presence of periventricular intraparenchymal echodensities that represent hemorrhagic necrosis. One report compared the outcomes in 75 infants with extensive or localized intraparenchymal echodensities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Infants with extensive injury were more likely to die (79 versus 38 percent), have motor deficits (100 versus 70 percent), and have poor cognitive outcome (80 versus 57 percent) than those with localized lesions.</p><p>Although ultrasound has been most conventionally and widely performed to detect PVL in preterm infants, it is less effective in identifying infants who have noncystic PVL. In a study of 1749 infants with extremely low birth weight and normal ultrasound studies, 29 percent had either cerebral palsy or delayed mental development before 2 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Considering the increase in survival rate of extremely preterm infants, it would be reasonable to consider MRI to add more prognostic information for such high-risk infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal white matter and gray matter findings on brain MRI at term are predictors of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome, as illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 167 very preterm infants, moderate to severe cerebral white matter abnormalities on MRI performed at term equivalent (gestational age of 40 weeks) were found in 21 percent, and were associated with the following adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at a corrected age of 2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cognitive delay (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.7)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Motor delay (OR 10.3, 95% CI 3.5-30.8)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebral palsy (OR 9.6, 95% CI 3.2-28.3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurosensory impairment (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6-11.3)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The same study found that gray matter abnormalities on MRI at term equivalent were present in 82 infants (49 percent), and were also significantly associated (but less strongly than white matter abnormalities) with cognitive delay, motor delay, and cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar study of 86 prematurely born newborns found that neurodevelopmental outcome among survivors at 18 months was normal, borderline, and abnormal in 59, 26, and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Increasing severity of white matter injury, ventriculomegaly, and intraventricular hemorrhage on early MRIs (at median age 32 and 37 weeks post-gestation) were associated with abnormal outcome.</p><p/><p>Quantitative MRI studies have found a decreased volume of cortical gray matter in preterm infants at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-96</a>] and later in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-100</a>] in comparison with normal term infants. Such abnormalities in neuronal development may be associated with the cognitive dysfunction commonly observed in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, precise quantification of human brain development demonstrates that cortical surface area grows faster than cortical volume in an allometric scaling relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. This rate of growth is dose-dependently reduced with earlier interruption of pregnancy and is proportional to the risk of later developmental delay.</p><p>White matter injuries appear to be a major risk factor for cortical abnormalities in preterm infants. In a volumetric MRI study of 119 preterm infants, those with severe or moderate white matter injury had a 17 percent reduction of cortical gray matter volume, 25 percent reduction of absolute myelinated white mater volume, and a 49 percent increase of absolute cerebrospinal fluid volume compared with infants without white matter injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In subsequent studies from the same group, white matter injuries had a greater influence on reduction in gray matter at term than other variables (gender, gestational age, intrauterine growth retardation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intraventricular hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In addition, white matter injuries at term appear to be predictive of motor and cognitive impairment at 2 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>MRI findings may also be useful to predict disability in older infants or children. For example, in a study of 30 children 6 to 14 years of age with spastic diplegia, the extent of white matter reduction, severity of ventricular dilatation, involvement of the optic radiation, and thinning of the posterior corpus callosum correlated with full scale and performance IQ, but not with verbal IQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In another series of 31 children with spastic cerebral palsy and PVL, lateral ventricular volumes measured on MRI were larger in those with than without cognitive impairment or in age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Ventricular volumes were also greater in children with moderate or severe motor deficits than in those with mild deficits. However, the extent of increased periventricular intensity on T2-weighted scans performed in the neonatal period was not as predictive, correlating somewhat with mental impairment but not with the severity of cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strategies to prevent PVL emphasize the maintenance of cerebral perfusion. Systemic hypotension, cerebral vasoconstriction, or conditions that impair cerebrovascular autoregulation should be avoided by correcting abnormalities in blood pressure and blood gases (eg, hypocarbia, hypoxemia).</p><p>The role of neuroprotective agents in the prevention of PVL is being investigated. Antenatal exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> may be associated with a decreased risk of cystic PVL. In a retrospective, observational study of 883 preterm infants, the rate of cystic PVL was lower in infants whose mothers received antenatal betamethasone than in those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (adjusted odds ratio 0.3) or no glucocorticoid treatment (adjusted odds ratio 0.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periventricular-leukomalacia/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].
