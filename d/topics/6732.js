Other radiologic studies utilized include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Comparative studies on the use of these modalities for the evaluation for locoregional metastases in patients with cutaneous SCC are lacking. Thus, much of the information used to guide study selection is based upon information from studies in head and neck cancer and other malignancies.

Both CT and MRI can detect lymph node metastases.</p><p>Radiologic imaging with CT or MRI is also useful for evaluating tumor extent for preoperative planning and staging in patients with large or deeply invasive lesions. CT is superior to MRI for the evaluation of skull base invasion, involvement of cartilage, and bone erosion or destruction, while MRI is more useful for detecting perineural invasion, providing soft tissue contrast, defining tissue planes, and identifying bone marrow infiltration in the absence of significant osseous destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>CT is less expensive than MRI, and, in many clinical settings, CT is more easily attained.

PET functions through the detection of the accelerated uptake of intravenously administered fluorodeoxyglucose that occurs in tumor cells. A beneficial feature of PET is its ability to detect metastases in sites of fibrosis, necrosis, and dense scarring related to radiotherapy, areas that may be difficult to assess with other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, false-positive results are common with PET due to the incidental detection of metabolically active inflammatory, infectious, or other lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-positron-emission-tomography#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thoracic positron emission tomography&quot;, section on 'Technical issues'</a>.)</p><p>Another, less favorable feature of PET is the poor spatial resolution attained with this study. The integration of PET and CT (PET-CT) has addressed this issue through providing improved anatomic correlation.</p><p>Study data on the use of PET for the evaluation of lymph nodes specifically in patients with cutaneous SCC are limited to a retrospective study of 12 patients with cutaneous SCC in which PET detected lymph node metastases in three out of nine patients with high-risk SCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In head and neck cancer, the value of PET for the detection of occult metastases is uncertain; PET-CT may be more beneficial.

SLN biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure used extensively in melanoma and other malignancies for the detection of micrometastatic disease. In SLN biopsy, the lymph node or lymph nodes most likely to harbor metastases are identified through the use of lymphoscintigraphy to detect uptake of radiolabeled colloid and blue dye injected at the site of the tumor. Patients with SLNs positive for metastatic disease are considered for lymph node dissection, while those with negative SLNs are usually spared from this more extensive procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-in-melanoma#H1958502\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Lymph node evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>A 2006 systematic review that incorporated data from 85 patients with nongenital cutaneous SCC who underwent SLN biopsy found that SLN biopsy was positive in 17 (21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among a total of 20 patients who also underwent completion lymphadenectomy, SLN biopsy failed to detect lymph node metastasis in one patient. This false-negative result was thought to be attributable to a disruption in lymphatic flow due to the patient's prior history of radiation therapy. A subsequent systematic review including 231 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers (214 with nongenital cutaneous SCC) who underwent SLN biopsy found an overall positivity rate for SLNs of 14 percent and a false-negative rate of approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Although SLN biopsy has been used in the management of select patients with high-risk SCC, data are insufficient to determine whether early detection of microscopic metastatic disease has a beneficial effect on patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].

SLN biopsy was positive in two patients; however, 6 of 15 patients with negative SLN developed metastatic disease during the follow-up.

If benefit of SLN biopsy is proven in the future, knowledge of which patients are most likely to have a positive SLN biopsy will be useful. A review of the English language literature (through November 1, 2012) that stratified the results of SLN biopsy in patients with non-anogenital cutaneous SCC according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system found that SLN biopsy was positive in 0 of 9 stage T1 lesions (0 percent), 13 of 116 stage T2 lesions (11 percent), and 3 of 5 stage T4 lesions (60 percent), suggesting that a positive SLN biopsy is most likely to occur in patients with stage T2 or higher stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Perineural invasion, aggressive histologic growth patterns, and longstanding lesions are additional risk factors for metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>As in cutaneous SCC, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used for the evaluation for metastases and local tissue invasion.

Detection of lymph node metastasis via SLN biopsy in a patient with pathologic evidence for lymphatic invasion in a primary excision specimen of a BCC has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-locoregional-and-distant-metastases-in-cutaneous-squamous-cell-and-basal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Systemic therapy for advanced BCC is discussed separately.

If features associated with an elevated risk for metastasis are present (high-risk SCC), further evaluation with radiologic imaging may be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H11115543\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlarged regional lymph nodes detected on physical examination should be sampled via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or surgical excision in patients with cutaneous SCC. If disease is identified in lymph nodes, radiologic imaging to determine the size, number, and location of involved lymph nodes should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H2824139\" class=\"local\">'Patients with palpable lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for further evaluation of lymph node status when lymph nodes appear normal on physical examination are less certain. We typically proceed with radiologic imaging in patients with clinical or histopathologic features that suggest an elevated risk for metastasis. We suggest the use of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the initial evaluation for nodal disease. (See <a href=\"#H2824146\" class=\"local\">'Patients without palpable lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in high-risk cutaneous SCC is unknown as it is unclear whether the procedure improves patient outcomes. Additional studies are necessary to determine the role of SLN biopsy in cutaneous SCC. (See <a href=\"#H2824518\" class=\"local\">'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few data to guide the use of imaging studies for patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). CT or MRI studies may be used for the evaluation for metastases and deep local tumor invasion. The value of positron emission tomography (PET) and SLN biopsy in BCC is uncertain.
