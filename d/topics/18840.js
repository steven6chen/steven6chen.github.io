In that case, your doctor or nurse will do an imaging test called an ultrasound to figure out your due date. An ultrasound can create pictures of your baby when it is inside your body. Your doctor can use these pictures to measure your baby's size and figure out your due date.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448057\"><span class=\"h1\">When is a baby overdue?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baby is overdue if he or she has not been born by 42 weeks (2 weeks after the due date). A pregnancy that lasts longer than 42 weeks is also called a &quot;postterm pregnancy&quot; or &quot;postdates pregnancy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448064\"><span class=\"h1\">What can cause a baby to be overdue?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors don't usually know. But a woman has a higher chance of having her baby after the due date if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It's her first pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She's already had a baby that was born after its due date</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448071\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is it a problem for babies to be born after 42 weeks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies born after 42 weeks have a higher chance of having problems, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being too big (heavier than 10 pounds) &ndash; A big baby can get hurt if it cannot easily fit through the birth canal. A big baby can also damage the mother's body when it comes out through the birth canal. Sometimes, the mother has to have a c-section (surgery to get the baby out).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a bowel movement in the amniotic fluid before birth &ndash; Babies who breathe in some of their amniotic fluid with bowel movement in it can have breathing problems after they are born. </p><p/><p>Other problems that can happen are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The placenta might not work as well as it did earlier in the pregnancy &ndash; The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There can be too little amniotic fluid (water) surrounding the baby in the uterus &ndash; If there is not enough amniotic fluid, the umbilical cord can get squeezed. If the umbilical cord is squeezed, the baby might not get enough oxygen and nutrients from the placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448078\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if I am still pregnant after my due date?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are still pregnant after your due date, your doctor or nurse will do tests to check your baby's health. Most doctors and nurses do these tests at 41 or 42 weeks, but some women have these tests earlier. The tests can check:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby's heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby's breathing and movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of amniotic fluid that surrounds your baby in the uterus</p><p/><p>Depending on the test results and how far along your pregnancy is, your doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your pregnancy continue until your body is ready to give birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommend that you have the baby soon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448085\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my doctor or nurse recommends that I have my baby soon?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor or nurse recommends that you have your baby soon, he or she will discuss your choices.</p><p>If your body isn't ready to give birth, your doctor can give you medicines to help start your labor. When doctors use medicines to help start a woman's labor, they call it &quot;inducing labor.&quot; These medicines often work.</p><p>Your doctor can also do a c-section to deliver your baby. A woman might have a c-section if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to induce labor don't work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Her baby is too big to safely fit through her birth canal </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448092\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy if he or she is born after the due date?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most babies born after their due date are healthy. But babies born after their due date can look a little different at birth and have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long and thin arms or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry or peeling skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long hair and nails</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7448099\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shoulder dystocia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Postterm pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
