Certain bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, which do not usually cause infections in healthy people, can cause infections in people with a weakened immune system; these are called &quot;opportunistic&quot; infections. One way to measure the strength of the immune system of a patient with HIV is to measure the T cell count (also called the CD4 count). When the T cell count is below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> the patient has developed AIDS and is at risk for opportunistic infections. However, many opportunistic infections can be prevented by taking certain antibiotics and antifungal medications. HIV medications can also boost the T cell count, so the risk of opportunistic infections declines with ongoing treatment. An explanation of T cell counts is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Initial treatment of HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other topic reviews about the treatment of HIV are available separately.

In most cases, these medications can be discontinued after your immune system has significantly improved for at least 3 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumocystis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Pneumocystis</em> (pronounced new-mow-SIS-tis) <em>jirovecii</em> pneumonia (formerly called <em>Pneumocystis</em> <em>carinii</em> pneumonia or PCP) is an opportunistic infection of the lungs. It is the leading AIDS-related cause of pneumonia and death. It is possible to prevent most cases of PCP by taking an antibiotic.</p><p>Preventive treatment is very effective in preventing this type of pneumonia, and it is strongly recommended for people with a low T cell count (usually less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> a history of PCP pneumonia, or a history of thrush (a yeast infection in the mouth). </p><p>People who begin antiretroviral therapy for HIV may discontinue PCP preventive therapy when their T cell count is greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for at least three months. However, lifelong preventive treatment may be recommended for people who developed PCP when the T cell count was greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942342305\"><span class=\"h2\">Histoplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histoplasma is a fungus that grows in soil and areas contaminated with bat or bird droppings; it is more common in certain areas, such as the Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence River valleys, the Caribbean, southern Mexico, and certain parts of Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. It can cause pneumonia in people with HIV who have a low T cell count and who live in an area where there is a high risk of infection.</p><p>People who visit or live in these areas should avoid high risk activities, such as disturbing soil under bird roosting sites, demolishing old buildings, or exploring caves.</p><p>A preventive antifungal treatment may be recommended to people who have a low T cell count (generally less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> who are at high risk of becoming infected; this would include people who live in areas where the infection is common. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxoplasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxoplasmosis is an infection that is found worldwide and usually causes infection without any major symptoms. However, the parasite persists in the body and can cause a life-threatening infection in the brain in people with AIDS. A blood test is recommended after HIV is diagnosed to determine if a person has been exposed to the <em>Toxoplasma</em> parasite previously. Preventive treatment is recommended if the T cell count is less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. Certain antibiotics used to prevent PCP can also prevent toxoplasmosis.</p><p>If the blood test shows that the patient has never had toxoplasmosis infection in the past, it is important to avoid exposure. Common sources of the parasite include raw or rare meats (in particular lamb, beef, pork, or venison), cat stool, and soil.</p><p>If an HIV-infected person has <strong>not</strong> previously been exposed to <em>Toxoplasma</em>, measures to prevent infection are sometimes recommended, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat raw or rare lamb, beef, pork, or venison. Meat that is pink inside indicates that the meat is not adequately cooked; the internal temperature should be at least 165&ordm;F.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid changing cat litter; if someone cannot assist you, use gloves and wash hands when finished. Avoid touching stray cats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash hands after gardening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash hands and counter tops after preparing raw meat or poultry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash fruits and vegetables well before eating them raw.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) is an opportunistic infection that can develop in people with HIV who have T cell counts below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. MAC can cause high fevers, abdominal pain, and weight loss.</p><p><em>Mycobacterium avium</em> can be found throughout the environment; it is not possible to prevent infection through personal protective measures. Certain antibiotics can help reduce the risk of developing MAC infection, and in the past, an antibiotic was given to people with HIV when their T cell count was less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. However, many providers no longer routinely prescribe antibiotics to prevent MAC infection in people who are initiating antiretroviral therapy for HIV. If antibiotic treatment was already started, it can generally be stopped when the person's T cell count is greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for at least three months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Candida (yeast)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Candida</em> (yeast) infections of the mouth and vagina are more common in people with HIV. Yeast infections can also develop in other areas, such as in skin folds, in the groin, and around the anus. </p><p>Preventive treatments for candida are not usually recommended unless you have frequent infections. Yeast infections in women are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryptococcus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Cryptococcus</em> is a fungus that is found in the environment, particularly in soil frequented by birds. Infection with this fungus can lead to a lung infection called cryptococcosis (pronounced crip-toe-cah-COH-sis) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a severe brain infection (called cryptococcal meningitis). This infection is more common in people with a T cell count less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p>Cryptococcal infection is the fourth most common opportunistic infection in people with AIDS. The number of cases of cryptococcosis has declined since effective antiretroviral treatments (ART) became available, although this infection is still a relatively common AIDS-defining illness in people who do not take HIV medications.</p><p>Treatments to prevent cryptococcosis are not recommended because they have not been shown to improve survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Coccidioides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Coccidioides </em>is a fungus that can cause an infection, called coccidioidomycosis (pronounced cox-SID-ee-oh-doe-my-coe-sis). The most common type of coccidioidomycosis is a type of pneumonia known as Valley Fever. People who are infected with HIV are at risk for a serious body-wide coccidioidomycosis infection, known as disseminated coccidioidomycosis.</p><p>The majority of cases of coccidioidomycosis in the United States occur in the southwestern part of the country, primarily Arizona and California. The fungus is normally found in the soil, and most people become infected after inhaling spores of the fungus.</p><p>Treatments to prevent infection with <em>Coccidioides</em> are not usually recommended because they have not been shown to improve survival. However, people with HIV who live in areas where the fungus is common are advised to stay indoors during dust storms and to avoid activities that could expose them to dust or desert soil (eg, construction work, farming, gardening).</p><p>People who are HIV-positive who become infected with <em>Coccidioides</em> are generally treated as soon as possible with an antifungal medication; this can reduce the risk of developing serious complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytomegalovirus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that commonly causes infection in persons worldwide. CMV can lead to a mild illness with fever and body aches, but most of the time, this infection does not cause any symptoms. </p><p>However, CMV persists in the body, and in a patient with AIDS, CMV can lead to disease in the eyes, digestive system, brain, and spinal cord. Infection of the eye (retina) is the most common opportunistic CMV infection and can cause blurring and progressive loss of vision, and even blindness in people with AIDS.</p><p>Past exposure to CMV infection is common, with approximately 50 percent of the adults in the United States having been exposed at some point during their life. If a blood test in an HIV-infected patient demonstrates past infection, a routine eye examination should be done to look at the retina in people with T cell counts less than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> whether or not they have any eye symptoms.</p><p>Treatment to prevent infection with CMV is not usually recommended because this has not been shown to improve survival. However, anyone with early signs of CMV retinitis (eg, blurry vision, blind spots, flashing lights, or floaters) should contact their healthcare provider immediately because treatment for this condition is effective if given promptly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryptosporidium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Cryptosporidium</em> (pronounced crip-toe-spore-ID-ee-um) is a parasite that can infect people who consume contaminated drinking and swimming water. The parasite can also be spread through contact with feces from infected pets or humans. Infection with the parasite is called cryptosporidiosis, and is a common cause of diarrhea in people with HIV.</p><p>All people are susceptible to infection, but HIV-infected persons with T counts less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> can have an unusually severe and prolonged illness. To reduce the risk of infection, HIV infected people should wash hands after diaper changing or contact with pets or soil. Close contact with people who are infected with cryptosporidium should be avoided. During outbreaks that are thought to be related to contamination of the municipal water supply, drinking bottled water or boiling tap water can reduce the risk of becoming infected.</p><p>There is no proven preventive treatment for <em>Cryptosporidium</em>. However, the preventive antibiotics used for <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) may protect against cryptosporidial infection. Symptoms of infection usually resolve when T cells are boosted with HIV medications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H670513579\"><span class=\"h2\">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with HIV infection are at increased risk of developing infection (such as pneumonia) caused by the bacteria <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. Vaccines are recommended to prevent this infection. There are 2 types of pneumococcal vaccines, and people with HIV should get one of each type. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691564778\"><span class=\"h2\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by the bacteria <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. It most commonly affects the lungs, although it can affect other parts of the body. Some people are exposed to TB but do not have an active infection (this is called &quot;latent tuberculosis infection,&quot; or LTBI). People with LTBI should be treated with a medication or medications to kill the latent bacteria and prevent active TB later in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Tuberculosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942342433\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCONTINUATION OF PREVENTIVE TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive treatment for <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia and toxoplasmosis is usually discontinued when the T cell count is &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If preventive treatment for <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex was started, it is usually discontinued when the T cell count is &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for three months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments to prevent opportunistic infections are recommended for some people with HIV, especially when the T cell count is low. The risk of each infection varies by the T cell count. Although the best type of prevention is recovery of the immune system through the use of antiretroviral therapy, certain antibacterial and antifungal medications can help prevent infection in people with CD4 cell counts less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. These medications can usually be stopped when the immune system has sufficiently improved. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3698\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
