Oxidation of guanine leads to the formation of 8-oxo-6, 7, 8-dihydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine. Failure of base excision repair results in mispairing of this nucleotide with adenine and resultant somatic CG&ndash;AT transversions in multiple genes, including the <em>APC</em> and <em>KRAS </em>genes. The target genes that are mutated as a consequence of oxidative damage strongly influence the polyposis phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The two most common <em>MUTYH</em> gene mutations in Western Europeans and North Americans are Y179C and G396D (previously referred to as Y165C and G382D, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Among individuals with multiple colorectal adenomas in whom an <em>APC</em> mutation has been excluded, biallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutations are found in 7 to 13 percent of patients with &gt;100 adenomas and in 14 to 40 percent of patients with 10 to 99 adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/1,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2439746467\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>MUTYH</em>-associated polyposis is typically characterized by the presence of multiple colorectal adenomas; however, the phenotype can vary.

However, the clinical presentation can vary, and biallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutations have been identified in individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the setting of few (&lt;10) or no colorectal polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Although adenomas are the predominant polyp type in patients with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis, multiple hyperplastic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sessile serrated polyps have been reported in some patients. In a study that included 17 patients with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis, eight (47 percent) had at least one hyperplastic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sessile serrated polyp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, three (18 percent) met criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome, and of these, one patient had over 100 hyperplastic and sessile serrated polyps.

In contrast, the risk of CRC in monoallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutation carriers appears to be only marginally increased with an estimated lifetime risk of 5 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/5,16,19-22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,19-22,25,26</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eight studies that included 20,565 CRC cases and 15,524 controls, there was no significant increase in CRC risk in individuals with monoallelic G396D mutations, while individuals with a monoallelic Y179C mutation had a 1.3-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.77) increased risk of CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2439746486\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracolonic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the extraintestinal manifestations of <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis.

Other rare extracolonic features that have been reported in patients with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis include osteomas, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, dental cysts, desmoids, sebaceous hyperplasia, and Muir-Torre phenotype with sebaceous gland tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In one study that included 276 patients with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis from 181 families, gastric and duodenal polyps were noted in 11 and 17 percent of patients, respectively. The incidence of extraintestinal malignancies in individuals with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis was almost twice that of the general population (standardized incidence ratio 1.9; 95% CI 1.4&ndash;2.5) with a lifetime risk of 38 percent. The estimated lifetime risk of cancers of the duodenum, ovaries, bladder, and skin was significantly higher as compared with the general population (4, 10, 6, and 17 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, these estimates are based on small numbers of patients. While some studies have suggested an increased risk of breast cancer in individuals with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis, this has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382513458\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype phenotype correlation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical phenotype in patients with <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis with biallelic G396D mutations appears to be less severe than for Y179C homozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Biallelic pathogenic germline mutations in the <em>MUTYH </em>gene are required to establish the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. </p><p>If germline biallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutations are found, mutation-specific genetic testing should be offered to at-risk relatives of the index case. Siblings of the index case with biallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutations have a 25 percent chance of having inherited biallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutations and a 50 percent chance of being carriers of a monoallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutation. Since <em>MUTYH </em>mutations are present in 1 to 2 percent of the population, children of mono- or biallelic <em>MUTYH </em>mutation carriers have a 0.5 to 1.0 percent chance of inheriting two <em>MUTYH </em>mutations because the other parent might also be a <em>MUTYH </em>heterozygote. A cost-effectiveness analysis of Dutch <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis patients estimated that <em>MUTYH </em>testing in spouses of <em>MUTYH-</em>associated polyposis patients, and spouses of <em>MUTYH </em>heterozygotes, may be cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by an increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), endometrial cancer, and several other malignancies, including cancers of the ovary, renal pelvis, ureter, stomach, small bowel, bile duct, skin (sebaceous neoplasms), and brain (gliomas). Lynch syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair genes (<em>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2</em>) or loss of expression of <em>MSH2</em> due to deletion in the <em>EPCAM</em> gene.

Our recommendations are consistent with the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, which are based on expert consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, other guidelines recommend colonoscopy starting at age 18 for biallelic carriers or for those who do not choose to pursue genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mutyh-associated-polyposis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>We reserve colectomy for patients with documented or suspected CRC, or significant polyp burden that cannot be effectively managed with colonoscopic polypectomy.

Since data suggest monoallelic <em>MUTYH</em> mutations are associated with a small increase in risk for CRC, we therefore suggest that these individuals be managed the same as individuals with a first-degree relative with CRC, with colonoscopic surveillance every five years, beginning 10 years earlier than the earliest CRC diagnosis in the family.
