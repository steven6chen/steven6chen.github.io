Normally, the kidneys work to filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water. Kidney failure, also called &quot;end-stage renal disease,&quot; is when the kidneys stop working completely.</p><p>With hemodialysis, a machine takes over the job of the kidneys. The machine pumps blood out of the body, filters it, and returns it to the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56992 \">figure 1</a>). People have hemodialysis at least 3 times a week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24824181\"><span class=\"h1\">When do I prepare for hemodialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will need to start preparing a few months before you begin hemodialysis treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24824188\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for hemodialysis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You prepare for hemodialysis by talking with your doctor, making certain choices, and having surgery.</p><p>Before you start hemodialysis, you will need to choose where you have it. Most people can choose between having hemodialysis at a dialysis center (in a hospital or clinic) or at home. If you plan to have hemodialysis at home, you will need to get your home ready. You will need a dialysis machine and supplies. You might need to make changes to your home's plumbing or electricity.</p><p>You also need to prepare your body for hemodialysis by having surgery ahead of time. Your doctor will create an &quot;access,&quot; which is a way for the blood to leave and return to your body during hemodialysis. An access is usually created under the skin in the lower part of the arm. An access needs time to heal before it can be used.</p><p>There are 3 different types of access:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV fistula &ndash; Most people get this type of access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71644 \">figure 2</a>). To make this access, a doctor does surgery to connect an artery directly to a vein. An AV fistula needs to heal for 2 to 4 months or more before it can be used for dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV graft &ndash; To make this access, a doctor uses a rubber tube to connect an artery to a vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59794\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59794 \">figure 3</a>). An AV graft needs to heal for 2 weeks before it can be used for dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central venous catheter &ndash; To make this access, a doctor puts a tube in a large vein (usually in the neck) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69685 \">figure 4</a>). This access is usually used only short-term or if people don't have any other access. It doesn't work as well as an AV fistula or AV graft.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24824195\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I take care of my access?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the type of access you have. If you have a central venous catheter, the dialysis nurse will cover the catheter site with a clean dressing and waterproof bandage each time you have dialysis. You should keep the dressing and bandage in place until the next dialysis session.</p><p>If you have an AV fistula or graft, here is what you should do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash it with soap and warm water every day and before each dialysis treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check it every day to make sure that it's working normally and blood is flowing through it. When your access is working normally, you should be able to feel a vibration (called a &quot;thrill&quot;) over the area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be careful with the arm that has the fistula or graft. It's important that you not get an injury on that arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not scratch or pick at your access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not wear tight clothes or jewelry on the arm with the access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not sleep on the arm with the access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not let anyone take blood from or measure blood pressure in the arm with the access.</p><p/><p>Problems can sometimes happen with an AV fistula or graft access. Call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You don't feel a vibration &ndash; This could mean that your access has stopped working or closed up.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your access is red or warm &ndash; This could mean that your access is infected.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your access bleeds a lot after hemodialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24824202\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-between-dialysis-and-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing between dialysis and kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dialysis and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=planning-for-a-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Planning for a kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me?
