The term &quot;complication&quot; is used for a treatment toxicity that causes an important medical problem.</p><p>This topic will review the late complications of treatment for head and neck cancer. The care of patients with head and neck cancer during initial therapy, both to treat acute toxicity and to prevent late complications, is discussed separately.

The review concluded that approximately 50 percent of patients with xerostomia benefit from oral pilocarpine following RT.

Patients with head and neck cancer often have poor preexisting dentition and dental health. Poor dentition increases the risk of late complications, including osteoradionecrosis and infection.

Thus, patients should have a pretreatment dental evaluation that includes the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> treatments, and other oral and dental hygiene, which should be continued on a lifelong basis.

(See <a href=\"#H3822453\" class=\"local\">'Osteoradionecrosis and soft tissue necrosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822453\"><span class=\"h1\">OSTEORADIONECROSIS AND SOFT TISSUE NECROSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822476\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoradionecrosis is defined as exposed, irradiated bone in the absence of recurrent or residual tumor. Osteoradionecrosis is a complication of radiation therapy (RT) due to vascular obliteration and decreased vascular supply of the irradiated tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This leads to hypovascular areas with associated tissue hypoxia. Osteoradionecrosis is commonly precipitated by an injury (surgery, dental extractions, poor dentition, infection) to hypoxic bone tissue. </p><p>Symptoms of osteoradionecrosis can include pain, bad breath, dysgeusia, dysesthesia or anesthesia, trismus, difficulty with chewing and swallowing, speech difficulties, fistula formation, pathologic fracture, and infection. The radiologic interpretation of osteomyelitis of the mandible in a patient who has been treated with RT for head and neck cancer should be interpreted as osteomyelitis superimposed on osteoradionecrosis until proven otherwise.</p><p>In some cases, osteoradionecrosis is manifested by asymptomatic exposure of a small area of bone that remains stable for months to years and heals with conservative management. In other cases, osteoradionecrosis may gradually progress and be associated with skin fistulas or infections. Severe necrosis may require surgical intervention and reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>The time to onset of osteoradionecrosis is quite variable. In some cases, it may be diagnosed shortly after completion of RT, while in other patients it may not be diagnosed for years after the original cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The mandible is the most frequently affected bone, because in many patients treated for head and neck cancer, a large portion of the mandible is exposed to high doses of radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Maxillary osteoradionecrosis is rare and seen most often in the setting of irradiation for nasopharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The vascular supply to the mandible is not as robust as the maxilla, which also predisposes the mandible to injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822484\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that affect the risk of developing osteoradionecrosis include tumor location and size, radiation technique and dose, and acute and chronic trauma to the mandible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maxilla. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of osteoradionecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>RT to oral cavity targets generally administers higher doses of radiation to larger volumes of the mandible than treatment of targets in the pharynx and larynx. As a consequence, osteoradionecrosis is most common in patients treated for tumors of the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of the literature that included 31 studies and over 4200 patients found that the incidence of osteoradionecrosis was similar regardless of treatment technique, ranging from 5 to 7 percent with conventional RT, IMRT, chemoradiotherapy (generally not using IMRT), or brachytherapy (with or without and external beam component) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The largest North American series of fast neutron therapy for targets above the clavicles observed a relatively low rate of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible or facial bones (crude incidence rate of 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The crude incidence of osteoradionecrosis with reirradiation is only slightly higher than that seen during the initial course of RT likely secondary to small expansions in the reirradiation setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>However, the significance of RT technique should be emphasized. When using IMRT, failure to limit &quot;hot-spots&quot; in the mandible can deposit excess dose and lead to osteoradionecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Meticulous attention to minimizing the volume of mandible receiving high doses of RT has the potential to minimize the risk. When using brachytherapy, differences in the relative contribution of the external beam and brachytherapy components of treatment can cause widely different crude incidence rates of osteoradionecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Finally, these comprehensive analyses include relatively few patients treated with IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy, the current standard of care for advanced head and neck cancer.</p><p>Unnecessary trauma to the irradiated <span class=\"nowrap\">mandible/maxilla</span> is to be avoided. This is at times difficult; a comprehensive review of dental disease in patients undergoing cancer therapy found that post-RT patients had the highest incidence of decayed, missing, and filled teeth of all cancer patients surveyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The association of osteoradionecrosis with dental factors has led to the recommendations for dental management during and after the initial treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H722455156\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Dental issues'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822503\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of osteoradionecrosis is complex.

However, when bone and soft tissue necrosis are extensive, resection of the mandible with immediate microvascular reconstruction may provide better results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Recurrent cancer must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of exposed mandible or maxilla especially if the exposure is in the same general anatomic area as the previously treated tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975122994\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperbaric oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperbaric oxygen is used at many centers to prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treat osteoradionecrosis.

The use of contemporary conformal RT techniques to minimize exposure of the salivary glands to radiation is the most important factor in the prevention of permanent salivary gland damage. For patients with symptomatic xerostomia, treatment approaches include lifestyle modification (moist soft foods, humidifiers), saliva substitutes and nonpharmacologic salivary gland stimulants, and pharmacologic stimulation with parasympathomimetic agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cevimeline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cevimeline</a>).

The primary risk factors associated with the development of osteoradionecrosis are dental extractions and surgery. Compromised teeth in an area that will receive at least 50 Gy and teeth that are outside of the RT treatment field but have a hopeless prognosis should be extracted prior to the initiation of therapy. There is no indication to extract health teeth. After therapy, routine dental care and supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoride</a> are recommended. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For mild cases of osteoradionecrosis, treatment with conservative debridement and antibiotics, is usually sufficient.
