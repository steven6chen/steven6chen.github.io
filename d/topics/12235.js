The management of osteoporosis in these patients is more complex than in patients without CKD and depends upon whether the patient also has coexisting chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (MBD), a constellation of findings including abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or vitamin D; abnormalities in bone physiology including turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular or other soft tissue calcification.

Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</strong></span> &ndash; For patients with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute,</span> we suggest a total calcium intake (diet plus supplement) of 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> with 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or less of this total amount provided by calcium supplementation. The difference between the calcium provided by supplementation and total calcium intake should be provided by nutritional means (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 2</a>). Since dairy products also contain phosphorus, nondairy sources of calcium (calcium-fortified orange juice, soy products, vegetables) may be preferred in some patients. We also suggest 800 international units of vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) daily.</p><p/><p>The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on fracture risk or falls in patients with CKD and eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> has not been adequately studied. Thus, recommendations regarding calcium and vitamin D supplementation for the management of osteoporosis in patients with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> are mostly based upon low-quality evidence and data extrapolated from patients without severe CKD. The data from postmenopausal women showing the benefit of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk of falls and hip fractures suggest that there may be a benefit to repleting vitamin D in patients with more severe CKD, and the potential benefit of vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) repletion appears to be far greater than the risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In contrast, excess calcium supplementation (as opposed to calcium obtained by nutritional means) in patients with eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> may be associated with an increase in arterial calcification and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This negative relationship may be related to many cofactors seen in more severe CKD, including hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Positive calcium and phosphate balance and calcium intake'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with normal or mild impairment in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (eg, eGFR &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute),</span> hypercalcemia does not typically occur with vitamin D supplementation until serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. This is due to the great capacity of the kidney to increase urine calcium clearance. However, in patients with eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute,</span> this homeostatic adaptation is impaired, and lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may induce hypercalcemia. Hence, monitoring the serum calcium more closely in these patients is important, particularly when eGFR is &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.

Patients with severe CKD often have sarcopenia, a systemic condition of muscle mass deficiency and poor muscle strength, receiving more attention by the National Institutes of Health and various professional societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Improving muscle tone and strength and improving balance are important nonpharmacologic interventions that should be incorporated into the overall management of all osteoporosis patients and, in particular, in patients with CKD. Systemic muscle weakness can be screened by a simple, office-based examination, including hand grip strength and get-up-and-go gait speed (eg, &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">M/second)</span>. People who cannot get out of a chair without using their hands have a high risk for falling. Intervention strategies include targeted physical therapy and other core-strengthening modalities and improving balance.

For men with CKD and symptomatic hypogonadism, we administer testosterone therapy (in the absence of contraindications). The dose of testosterone does not need to be adjusted based upon renal function.

The reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures was similar in these two groups. It is important to emphasize that in teriparatide clinical trials (and in all other postmenopausal pharmacologic clinical trials) patients with elevated baseline serum levels of PTH were excluded. Thus, there are no clinical trial data examining the efficacy of teriparatide in patients with evidence of CKD-MBD (hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Teriparatide</a> may be beneficial in patients with adynamic bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/33,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,54,55</a>]. In a case report, teriparatide (20 mcg by subcutaneous injection daily) was administered to a patient with dialysis-dependent CKD who presented with multiple painful fractures and bone histomorphometry showing low-turnover bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Bone pain resolved within six months, and after 24 months, bone histomorphometry showed improvement in parameters of bone formation. The pharmacokinetics of teriparatide were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with normal kidney function. Larger studies are needed to assess the role of teriparatide in adynamic bone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adynamic-bone-disease-associated-with-chronic-kidney-disease#H107230873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adynamic bone disease associated with chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Experimental therapies'</a>.)</p><p>The teriparatide-induced improvement in parameters of bone formation may be mediated by its effect on sclerostin. Idiopathic renal adynamic bone disease is associated with elevated serum sclerostin, an osteoblast inhibitor. PTH inhibits sclerostin binding to osteoblasts, thereby promoting bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Thus, it seems plausible that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a> might have value in this population. In addition, the development of monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin, currently in phase III clinical development, might offer a targeted therapy for idiopathic renal adynamic bone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1434626657\"><span class=\"h3\">Abaloparatide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abaloparatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abaloparatide</a> (PTH-related peptide [PTHrP] analogue) is a second anabolic agent available for the treatment of osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoporosis-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].
