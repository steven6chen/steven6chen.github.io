It most often results from immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to foods, drugs, and insect stings, but any agent capable of inciting a sudden, systemic degranulation of mast cells can produce it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It can be difficult to recognize because it can mimic other conditions and is variable in its presentation. This topic will review the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, diagnostic criteria, and common causes and contributory factors.

In a retrospective cohort study of 214 emergency department patients, these criteria were found to have a sensitivity of 97 percent compared with an allergist's diagnosis upon review of the case, as well as a specificity of 82 percent, a positive predictive value of 69 percent, and a negative predictive value of 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, although the diagnostic criteria are helpful, they do not replace provider clinical judgment.</p><p>There are three diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, each reflecting a different clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any <strong>one</strong> of the following three criteria is fulfilled:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3500754922\"><span class=\"h3\">Criterion 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) involving the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)<strong> and at least one of the following</strong>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">wheeze/bronchospasm,</span> stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">OR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms and signs of end-organ malperfusion (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)</p><p/><p>Note that skin symptoms and signs are present in up to 90 percent of anaphylactic episodes.

However, anaphylaxis is unpredictable. It may be mild and resolve spontaneously due to endogenous production of compensatory mediators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, angiotensin II, endothelin, and others) or it may be severe and progress within minutes to respiratory or cardiovascular compromise and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At the onset of an anaphylactic episode, it is not possible to predict how severe it will become, how rapidly it will progress, and whether it will resolve promptly and completely or become biphasic or protracted, because the factors that determine the course of anaphylaxis in an individual patient are not fully understood. Thus, early administration of epinephrine is essential to prevent the progression to life-threatening manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Death from anaphylaxis can occur within minutes. In a series of 164 cases of fatal anaphylaxis, the median time interval between onset of symptoms and respiratory or cardiac arrest was 5 minutes in iatrogenic anaphylaxis, 15 minutes in stinging insect venom-induced anaphylaxis, and 30 minutes in food-induced anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

When the cause of the observed symptoms is in doubt, treatment for anaphylaxis is initiated. The clinical diagnosis can sometimes be retrospectively supported by documentation of elevated concentrations of serum or plasma total tryptase or plasma histamine, although the results of these tests are not immediately available to the treating clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/41,53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,53-56</a>]. It is critical to obtain blood samples for measurement of these mast cell and basophil mediators soon after the onset of symptoms because elevations are transient. Instructions for proper collection of samples are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 6</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum or plasma total tryptase</strong> &ndash; The standardized assay for measurement of total serum or plasma tryptase is widely available in clinical laboratories (normal range 1 to 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. In infants under age 6 months, normal baseline total tryptase concentrations are higher than they are in older infants, children, and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57</a>]. Optimally, the blood sample for tryptase measurement needs to be obtained within 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset. However, tryptase may remain elevated for 6 or more hours after the onset and therefore may still be informative if obtained after 3 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Tryptase elevations are more likely to be detected in anaphylaxis from stinging insect venoms or medications and during reactions that involve hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/53,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A tryptase level that is within normal limits cannot be used to refute the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The history is more important than the test results. As an example, in individuals with food-induced anaphylaxis or in patients who are normotensive, tryptase levels are seldom elevated, even in optimally timed blood samples obtained within 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serial measurements of total tryptase in serum or plasma over several hours may increase the sensitivity and the specificity of the tests. In a prospective study, sequential serum tryptase concentrations were measured in 102 adults with anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Tryptase levels 1 to 2 hours after onset of the episode were significantly elevated (19.3&plusmn;15.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> compared with levels at 4 to 6 hours and at 12 to 24 hours after the onset and at baseline (all &lt;11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. However, tryptase was not elevated in 37 percent of cases. A rise in total tryptase levels above baseline may be more sensitive than a single measurement. In adults with venom-induced allergic reactions, an increase in tryptase of &ge;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> was 73 percent sensitive and 98 percent specific for anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Sixty percent of children with anaphylaxis had an elevation of &ge;2 + 1.2 x baseline tryptase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Patients with mast cell disorders may have hypotensive reactions to insect stings, even in the absence of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The real world utility of tryptase measurements was assessed in a study of 426 cases of suspected anaphylaxis admitted to three emergency departments over the course of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Tryptase was obtained in 141 cases (33 percent), at a mean of 4.75 hours after estimated onset of symptoms and again after resolution in 23 cases. In this setting, a tryptase above 12.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> had a high specificity (88 percent) and positive predictive value (0.93) and a low sensitivity (28 percent) and negative predictive values (0.17). Serum tryptase was more likely to be elevated in patients with hypotension, as has been observed in other studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma histamine</strong> &ndash; Plasma histamine levels typically peak within 5 to 15 minutes of the onset of anaphylaxis symptoms and then decline to baseline by 60 minutes due to rapid metabolism by N-methyltransferase and diamine oxidase. Elevated plasma histamine levels correlate with anaphylaxis symptoms and signs and are more likely to be increased than are total serum tryptase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Measurement of this mediator may be useful in cases of anaphylaxis occurring in a hospital setting in which blood samples can be collected soon after the onset of symptoms. In many cases of anaphylaxis in the community, however, it is not practical to measure histamine, because often by the time the patient reaches the emergency department, levels have returned to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/41,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histamine should be measured in plasma rather than serum because clotting may result in release of histamine that is artifactual and only occurs ex vivo due to compromised basophil cell membranes. Blood samples for histamine require special handling. Draw blood through a wide-bore needle, keep it cold at all times, centrifuge it immediately, and freeze the plasma promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

It most often results from immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to foods, drugs, and insect stings, but any agent capable of inciting a sudden, systemic degranulation of mast cells can produce it. (See <a href=\"#H4007691360\" class=\"local\">'Definition and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, which reflect the different ways in which anaphylaxis may present. Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any <strong>one</strong> of the three criteria is fulfilled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 1</a>). These diagnostic criteria do not replace clinical judgment, particularly for a patient with a prior episode of anaphylaxis (see <a href=\"#H1914347526\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although recognition of the clinical syndrome of anaphylaxis is generally straightforward, some cases may be difficult to diagnose because anaphylaxis can mimic many other disorders and can be variable in its presentation. Anaphylaxis may present with various combinations of as many as 40 potential symptoms and signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3159936636\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prompt recognition is critical in anaphylaxis. In fatal anaphylaxis, median times to cardiorespiratory arrest are 5 minutes in iatrogenic anaphylaxis, 15 minutes in stinging insect venom-induced anaphylaxis, and 30 minutes in food-induced anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is also unpredictable. It may be mild and resolve spontaneously due to endogenous production of compensatory mediators or it may be severe and progress within minutes to respiratory or cardiovascular compromise and death. At the onset of an anaphylactic episode, it is not possible to predict how severe it will become or how rapidly it will progress. For these reasons, early and definitive treatment of suspected anaphylaxis is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H2246678592\" class=\"local\">'Time course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients and health care professionals commonly fail to recognize and diagnose anaphylaxis in its early stages when it is most responsive to treatment. In particular, there is a reluctance to diagnose anaphylaxis in the absence of hypotension, even though this sign is not required for the diagnosis and is uncommon in children with anaphylaxis or in food-induced anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H349993124\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic pitfalls'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaphylaxis most often results from an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. Common causes include foods, insect stings, and medications, although there is a rapidly expanding list of novel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unusual causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70667\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70667 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H287552937\" class=\"local\">'Causes and mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on clinical criteria. The results of measurements of tryptase and other mediators are not available immediately at the point of care. However, detection of elevated total tryptase (in serum or plasma) or histamine (in plasma) can be helpful in excluding other disorders that do not involve activation of mast cells and basophils. Of note, elevations in these mediators are transient and are not detected in many patients. The blood sample for tryptase should be obtained within 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 6</a>).
