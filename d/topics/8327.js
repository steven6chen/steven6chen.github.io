Individuals 85 years and older make up only 1.8 percent of the total population but account for 8 percent of all hospital discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hospitalizations and health care spending for older adults are expected to rise as the population continues to age.</p><p>The leading diagnoses for admission among community-dwelling adults &ge;65 years are cardiovascular diseases (28.6 percent) and infections (16.2 percent), with pneumonia and septicemia being the two most common infectious causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Older patients have a longer average length of stay compared with younger patients (5.5 days for ages &ge;65 years, 5.0 days for ages 45 to 64 years, and 3.7 days for ages 15 to 44 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With advancing age, patients tend to have more comorbid chronic illnesses and disability, making them more vulnerable during hospitalization to adverse events, including nosocomial complications and adverse drug reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While most younger patients are discharged to home, 40 percent of patients 85 years and older are discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Most hospital-based clinicians are not trained to treat older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Despite the disproportionate prevalence of hospitalized patients who are in the older age range, hospitalist programs often do not emphasize the need for geriatric skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss common issues related to the management of older hospitalized patients. The medical care of older adults in the outpatient setting and in nursing homes is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046690\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED VULNERABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older adults have greater vulnerability to acute stress than younger individuals due to age-related diminution of physiologic reserves. This vulnerability is compounded by the greater prevalence of chronic disease (eg, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure) in older adults. Measuring physiologic vulnerability in older adults can be challenging. Diminished renal function can be detected with serum creatinine, but quantifying the decline in organ function in other systems, such as the liver, heart, lungs, and brain, is more challenging. Often, vulnerability only becomes evident in hindsight after organ failure. Muscle strength and reserve also decline with aging, with detrimental impact on physical function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging#H23810845\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;, section on 'Age-associated physiologic changes'</a>.)</p><p>At baseline, the older adult lives in a state in which organ systems, while functioning with some compromise, are able to sustain life in relative harmony. This state has been termed homeostenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58907 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].<em> </em>An acute insult or stressor may push one or more organ systems &ldquo;over the brink,&rdquo; resulting in organ failure. When one organ system fails, others often follow. Thus, when an older adult with several chronic medical conditions develops an acute illness, those organ systems that are seemingly unrelated to the presenting problem may lack the reserve to withstand the stresses of the acute illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The resulting failure of the heart, lungs, kidneys, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brain (delirium) appears apart from the original complaint for which the patient was hospitalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H657887\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging and the cumulative effects of a lifetime of illness allow for a wide range in functional abilities of older adults, such that actual age may not always correlate with physiologic age; some older patients are fully independent while others are not. Thus, it is important to perform a thorough initial patient assessment to understand the patient&rsquo;s physiologic status and functional abilities. The assessment of older hospitalized adults should extend beyond the traditional history and physical examination. In particular, the clinician should assess the patient&rsquo;s physical function, cognition, social supports, and living situation. They should specifically inquire about advanced directives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81811 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Available tools for inpatient assessment of physical function and the risk of adverse outcomes have relatively poor positive predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Specific risk factors for new onset disability at discharge include age &ge;80 years, dependence in three or more criteria in the assessment of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) two weeks before admission, poor mobility at baseline (as defined by inability to walk uphill or stairs), severe cognitive impairment, metastatic cancer, and albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Impaired arousal on hospital admission has been correlated with increased mortality at six months; arousal can be assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57874 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Instruments to be used for the assessment of physical ADL (the Katz index for ADL) and IADL (the Lawton scale for IADL) are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66451 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63647 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Patients should be asked about substance abuse, including alcohol and nicotine. Additionally, medications should be reviewed in detail to identify unnecessary polypharmacy or dosing problems, including the potential for medication duplication. (See <a href=\"#H657914\" class=\"local\">'Medication reconciliation'</a> below.)</p><p>Pain is a common symptom for many older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It is important to consider the impact pain has on daily functioning in older patients and how it may be contributing to the patient&rsquo;s current presentation. Untreated pain can cause delirium, suffering, and inability to participate in prescribed medical therapies. A patient&rsquo;s own report of pain is the best way to determine degree of pain. Understanding whether a patient with advanced cognitive impairment suffers from pain can be challenging, but there are validated <a href=\"https://geriatricpain.org/assessment/cognitively-impaired/pain-assessment-advanced-dementia-painad-instructions&amp;token=31qpd8uxDTNcdg4hk2bvxwHdi0afDPIXVuP3bmmeM3ts91YVF4JUMNSLWYbAfN6MJMdvDixImzjPhVfdhJFv+F082mAEv5dIsMQmSyGZ0zMqyOi+9KH8nQX9NSm0sH1h&amp;TOPIC_ID=16283\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">tools</a> to aid in this assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The American Geriatrics Society has developed guidelines to aid clinicians in assessing and treating older adults with pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H657914\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication reconciliation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 30 percent of hospital admissions are the result of adverse drug events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since older patients often take multiple medications daily and are more vulnerable to adverse drug events, it is particularly important to ensure that a complete and accurate list of medications is obtained at each transition within the hospital setting: on admission, during transfers between hospital wards, and at discharge. Hospital pharmacists can be helpful as a resource for medication reconciliation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-adverse-drug-events-in-hospitals#H31685278\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of adverse drug events in hospitals&quot;, section on 'Medication reconciliation'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluating the clinical utility of each medication and its potential for side effects or drug interactions is critical to caring for patients&rsquo; acute needs and preventing adverse drug events. Some drugs may be non-prescription, and patients should be specifically queried about use of over-the-counter medications, including complementary or herbal medication use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H657921\"><span class=\"h2\">Advance directives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient's goals, values, and preferences in regard to treatment decisions are particularly relevant during an acute hospitalization, especially in older patients given a larger burden of illness. Inpatient clinicians should know who has been identified as the patient's surrogate decision-maker (health care proxy). The patient&rsquo;s desired intensity of care, including goals, values, and preferences regarding resuscitation and artificial respiration must be clarified with the patient, when possible, or with the health care proxy if the patient is not capable of understanding or communicating this information. It is important to discuss existing advance directives with a patient when they are hospitalized, as a retrospective study of hospitalized patients in one US health care system found that patients modified their preferences for life-sustaining treatments after hospitalization and that patients 65 years and older were more likely to add limitations than younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Understanding these issues will guide which treatments are most appropriate for a given patient.</p><p>In the case of older patients with underlying dementia or delirium, it becomes important to find a surrogate decision-maker quickly to help guide the patient&rsquo;s goals of care. For patients who have not created a health care power of attorney, the spouse or other first-degree relative typically is the default surrogate decision-maker. If no surrogate is designated and next-of-kin is not available, guardianship may be obtained. Guardianship is a legal proceeding whereby the court appoints a surrogate decision-maker. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Legal aspects in palliative and end of life care in the United States&quot;, section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H657928\"><span class=\"h2\">Social support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important component of the admission assessment for older patients is inquiry about the patient's home situation and social supports. Multiple aspects of the living situation can impact the health of the older patient (eg, living with family or friends, having part- or full-time help, being in a home versus assisted living facility, the presence of stairs, access to mealtime support). Questionnaires to assess social resources for patients admitted from the community or a nursing home, adapted from the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire, are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53022\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53022 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64108\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64108 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A safe transition at discharge is dependent on an understanding of how the patient manages when not in the hospital. Planning for discharge must begin early in the course of the hospitalization to address all relevant factors and allow ample time to mitigate identified obstacles, thus avoiding unnecessarily prolonged hospitalization. Hospital-based social workers and discharge planners can help address concerns related to medication adherence, home safety, and access to community supports after discharge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospital-discharge-and-readmission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospital discharge and readmission&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5404484\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalization provides an important opportunity to address vaccination status, particularly for pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;, section on 'Immunizations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046739\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING SPECIFIC ADVERSE OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalization for the older adult patient can result in unintended adverse consequences from interventions meant to be therapeutic. Bed rest, polypharmacy, tethering devices (eg, intravenous lines, urinary catheters, telemetry, restraints), sensory deprivation, disruption of usual sleep patterns, and lack of proper nutrition all contribute to functional, physical, and cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Since many older adults live on the brink between independence and functional dependence, even a small decline in function during hospitalization can place them in a position of newly acquired dependence.</p><p>Some decline may be unavoidable due to the effects of the acute illness. However, many of the harmful effects of hospitalization can be avoided or minimized by addressing specific risks that predispose to a poor clinical outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046746\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional decline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bed rest and lack of mobility combine to hasten physical deconditioning and muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Immobility is associated with increased risk for falls, delirium, skin breakdown, and venous thromboembolic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Improved mobility during hospitalization has been linked to decreased risk of death at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although a few conditions require absolute bedrest (eg, unstable fractures and certain critical illnesses), most medical conditions do not necessitate immobility. Activity orders for bed rest should be avoided unless absolutely medically required. Nursing staff should attempt to get patients out of bed to a chair at least twice daily with meals and, when possible, encourage patients to walk.</p><p>Patients who have difficulty ambulating on their own or who pose a significant fall risk may need supervision by trained staff (eg, physical therapy) or referral to a specialized mobility program. Increased activity during hospitalization can mitigate functional decline so that patients can transition optimally outside the hospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25046837\" class=\"local\">'Early mobilization programs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31092115\"><span class=\"h2\">Falls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older hospitalized adults are at great risk of falling due to the effects of the acute illness compounded by an unfamiliar environment and side effects of treatments. The etiology of a fall is often multifactorial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63126 \">figure 2</a>). Many of the interventions needed to address the acute illness can increase the risk of falling. As an example, interventions to treat an older adult in heart failure (eg, antihypertensive medications, diuretics, telemetry, and an indwelling urinary catheter) all combine to increase the patient&rsquo;s propensity to fall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several strategies can help prevent falls in the hospital setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-nursing-care-facilities-and-the-hospital-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in nursing care facilities and the hospital setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks and benefits of medications with significant psychotropic and anticholinergic effects (eg, opioid analgesics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>) should be carefully weighed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be monitored when prescribed drugs that might increase the risk of falls (eg, when diuretics are prescribed, blood pressure and volume status should be monitored closely to avoid orthostatic hypotension).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at higher fall risk may need supervision with ambulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time out of bed throughout the day should be encouraged, whether walking or sitting in a chair, to prevent orthostatic hypotension associated with prolonged immobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous lines and urinary catheters should be discontinued as early as possible. (See <a href=\"#H25046760\" class=\"local\">'Tethers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restraints should be avoided since restraints, either physical or pharmacologic (eg, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines), may increase the risk of falling.</p><p/><p>Nonetheless, it is likely that the majority of falls that occur in the hospital setting may not actually be preventable. Bed alarms have not been demonstrated to be effective at reducing falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and may increase the risk of alarm fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In the United States, Medicare does not reimburse hospitals for complications or extended length of stay related to falls that occur during the course of hospitalization. It is important that institutions not adopt potentially deleterious practices, such as increased use of strict bed rest orders, restraints or restraint-like chairs or other devices, in an effort to decrease their revenue losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31092207\"><span class=\"h2\">Delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delirium is an acute confusional state marked by inattention and a fluctuating course. The Confusion Assessment Method is frequently used to diagnose delirium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69489 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. An altered level of consciousness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disorganized thinking are usual components of delirium. Early recognition of delirium is important to ensuring prompt delivery of appropriate care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Many aspects of hospitalization inherently promote delirium for the older patient. The change in environment from the comfort of home to a hospital room is disruptive to the patient&rsquo;s daily routine. An older patient, particularly someone with preexisting cognitive impairment, is prone to developing delirium with changes in environment and sensory deprivation. Pain, interruption in sleep patterns, and several classes of medications are important risk factors for delirium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70449 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Confusional states can also be worsened when sensory input is affected, such as occurs when a patient lacks access to eyeglasses or hearing aids.</p><p>Effective measures to prevent delirium include orientation protocols, environmental modification, nonpharmacologic sleep aids (eg, warm milk or herbal tea offered at bedtime, relaxing music, soft lighting, massage), early mobilization, minimizing use of physical restraints, use of visual and hearing aids, adequate pain treatment, and reduction in polypharmacy (particularly psychoactive drugs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/30,31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,35</a>]. The management of patients with delirium is summarized in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59337 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A systemic review and meta-analysis found that there is no evidence to prescribe antipsychotic medication for the prevention or treatment of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Guidelines from the American Geriatrics Society and the American College of Surgeons on the prevention and treatment of postoperative delirium and similarly recommend against the use of antipsychotic medications in this population as well, unless there is concern for imminent harm to the patient or care team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Some hospitals have found that patients with delirium benefit from specialized care delivered in a dedicated room for disoriented patients. This room supports multidisciplinary care that avoids the use of restraints and reduces use of psychoactive drugs. These &ldquo;delirium rooms&rdquo; can offer a viable option for caring for delirious patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27678152\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleeplessness/sleep deprivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple factors contribute to sleep deprivation during hospitalization, including an unfamiliar sleep setting, conditions related to illness (eg, shortness of breath, pain), environmental factors (eg, noise, light), and the logistics of providing care (eg, phlebotomy, medication schedules). Inadequate sleep, whether it is too short in duration, of poor quality, or interrupted, may contribute to a host of complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-definition-epidemiology-and-adverse-outcomes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes&quot;, section on 'Effects of acute sleep deprivation'</a>.)</p><p>The link between poor sleep and delirium remains elusive. However, older hospitalized adults who received a multicomponent intervention, including protocols to address sleep deprivation, had a decreased risk for developing delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Strategies such as bundling care at night (eg, vital sign monitoring, dispensing medications, toileting) and creating a conducive environment for sleep with low light and quiet surroundings may help achieve improved sleep for patients receiving care in the hospital and decrease the risk for delirium and other adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046760\"><span class=\"h2\">Tethers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some tethering medical devices, such as urinary catheters, intravascular lines, cardiac telemetry leads, and restraints, may be necessary to provide optimal care. However, tethering devices make it more difficult to mobilize patients safely and are associated with increased rates of delirium, infection, and falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Tethers are commonly ordered when not absolutely indicated and, even when initially appropriate, may remain in place when no longer needed. As an example, despite the well-publicized risks of indwelling urinary catheters, their use and associated complications have not declined over several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;, section on 'Inappropriate use of catheters'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of each tethering device and initiate use only when the likelihood of benefit is significant and in keeping with the patient's preferred intensity of care, and there is no effective alternative.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot;, section on 'Acute geriatric care units'</a>.)</p><p>One meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials evaluating geriatric rehabilitative units (within an acute care hospital or a rehabilitation hospital) found that inpatient multidisciplinary programs were associated with improvement in all outcomes at discharge, including better functional status (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.31-2.35), decreased nursing home admission (relative risk [RR] 0.64, 0.51-0.81), and reduced mortality (RR 0.72, 0.55-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Another meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials found that hospitalized patients receiving comprehensive geriatric evaluation in a geriatric unit were more likely to be alive and in their homes during at 6- and 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. This meta-analysis was limited by wide variability in interventions across trials.</p><p>These geriatric units rely upon team-based care as well as staffing and environmental modifications to the unit to address some of the difficulties older adults face during hospitalization. However, due to a longer length of stay (up to three months), such rehabilitative units are rarely available in the United States outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12189686\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternatives to hospital care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalization is disruptive for all individuals, but particularly so for medically complex older patients. Additionally, older patients are particularly vulnerable to medical errors that occur during transitions of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Avoiding hospitalization and providing care within the patient&rsquo;s home environment can sometimes meet the medical needs of the patient, as well as align with the patient&rsquo;s goals of care around intensity of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Only patients who require care that can be uniquely provided in the hospital should be admitted. For selected patients, home health services or care within nursing homes may provide enough support for older adults with an illness such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection. If such services align with the patient&rsquo;s desired intensity of care and are medically appropriate, the hazards of hospitalization can be avoided.</p><p>Unfortunately, reimbursement rules in the United States often prevent the mobilization of adequate resources in the home environment to allow hospital-level care in the home to be a viable option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046865\"><span class=\"h1\">PALLIATIVE/COMFORT-FOCUSED CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines have been suggested to help clinicians identify patients at the time of hospital admission who might benefit from palliative care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76969 \">table 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51669 \">table 14</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Larger hospitals often have special palliative care teams to provide care to this population. It is critical to minimize medications and treatments that are perceived as burdensome to the patient who has chosen care with a focus on comfort. Providers should identify patients suffering from pain or other troublesome symptoms (eg, confusion, constipation, nausea, and dyspnea) and work to address these symptoms to improve comfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25046872\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the transition from hospital to home or skilled nursing facility (SNF), older patients are particularly vulnerable to medication errors and confusion about follow-up care. It is increasingly rare for a single clinician to provide both inpatient and outpatient care, which further increases the challenges of maintaining high-quality care during this transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. While most younger patients are discharged to home, 40 percent of patients 85 years and older are discharged to a SNF prior to going home, which adds a second transition and a third set of care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Moreover, due to higher rates of cognitive impairment, older adults may be less able than younger patients to participate actively in their discharge plan of care.</p><p>Few data are available demonstrating that discharge interventions prevent hospital readmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Clinicians and others working with older patients at the time of discharge should strongly consider partnering with the patient&rsquo;s family or other social supports to increase the likelihood that the care transition will go smoothly. A discharge checklist can be particularly helpful to ensure that the clinician covers the most salient issues for a smooth transition out of the hospital (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54279 \">table 15</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospital-management-of-older-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Select interventions at discharge are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospital-discharge-and-readmission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospital discharge and readmission&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several programs have been developed to improve the hospital discharge process, including <a href=\"http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/Web/Quality_Innovation/SHM_Signature_Programs/Mentored_Implementation/Web/Quality___Innovation/Mentored_Implementation/Project_BOOST/Project_BOOST.aspx&amp;token=mSDDmkGHUPZqXi4LKYhxKStyROdT5s7HRyzI8DXjbIMR3Q94SJcY3JHvLqlOawQ3ggQ5cVuZg/P4NNcsQv7hf2z+acaTpy6LZhJrmegh68yPq5mnG0eF0jfALI9pm+RbCRLq3Bnf35R48TQyqf3kNw4hSmZQY0j1VTb9zlPv+5M=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16283\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Project BOOST</a> and the <a href=\"http://caretransitions.org/&amp;token=y7Y7ppoEKQIC+a7pjR6k7wXuOF1SwYEpc03ofko4X+jU04trOAXvLjCJqemTEYJu&amp;TOPIC_ID=16283\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Care Transitions Program</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H25046683\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25046690\" class=\"local\">'Increased vulnerability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment of older hospitalized adults should extend beyond the traditional history and physical to include assessment of physical function and cognition, social supports, and living situation as well as evaluation for possible polypharmacy and attention to advance directives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81811 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H657887\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since many older adults live on the brink between independence and functional dependence, even a small decline in function during hospitalization can place them in a position of newly acquired dependence. However, many adverse outcomes encountered by older adults during hospitalization can be prevented (see <a href=\"#H25046739\" class=\"local\">'Preventing specific adverse outcomes'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Activity orders for bed rest should be avoided unless absolutely required. Patients who have difficulty ambulating on their own or pose a significant fall risk may need supervision (eg, a nurse, physical therapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All tethers should be avoided whenever possible, including urinary catheters, intravascular lines, cardiac telemetry leads, and physical restraints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Effective measures to prevent delirium include orientation protocols, environmental modification, nonpharmacologic sleep aids, early mobilization, use of visual and hearing aids, adequate pain treatment, and reduction in polypharmacy (particularly psychoactive drugs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59337\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59337 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Standard precautions are recommended in the care of all hospitalized patients, including hand hygiene before and after every patient contact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77676 \">table 11</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simple interventions such as getting an older patient out of bed at mealtime and providing assistance are important in maximizing nutritional intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limiting time spent in one position can help prevent pressure ulcers. Bedbound patients should be repositioned at least every two hours, with proper repositioning techniques to minimize shear forces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minimizing the use of nonessential medications can reduce the risk of an adverse drug event. Avoiding high-risk drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51353 \">table 12</a>) and starting with the smallest possible therapeutic dose can similarly help avoid adverse drug events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some hospital-wide strategies are associated with improved outcomes for older adults, including care involving multidisciplinary teams, checklists, and early mobilization programs. (See <a href=\"#H25046802\" class=\"local\">'Hospital-wide interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important factor in determining if the intensive care unit (ICU) is appropriate for an older patient is to consider whether or not intensive care is congruent with an individual patient&rsquo;s care wishes. (See <a href=\"#H25046851\" class=\"local\">'Intensive care in critical illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients are particularly vulnerable to medication errors and confusion about follow-up care.
