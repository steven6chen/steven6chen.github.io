However, at age 13 years, if no menses have occurred and there is a complete absence of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, evaluation for primary amenorrhea should also begin. In addition, some girls with secondary sexual characteristics may present before age 15 years with amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain. These girls should be evaluated for possible outflow tract obstruction.

In addition, steroid receptor abnormalities and deficiencies in enzymes of steroidogenesis cause primary amenorrhea at the level of the ovary and the adrenal gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160545\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary amenorrhea is evaluated most efficiently by focusing on the presence or absence of breast development (a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary), the presence or absence of the uterus (as determined by ultrasound, or in more complex cases by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum FSH concentration is elevated, the probable diagnosis is gonadal dysgenesis (including Turner syndrome) and a karyotype should be obtained. In this scenario, a 46,XY karyotype is associated with a high risk for the development of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma, and surgical removal of the gonads is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-amenorrhea#H3257917141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Gonadal dysgenesis/primary ovarian insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If FSH is normal and the ultrasound indicates that the uterus is absent, the probable diagnosis is m&uuml;llerian agenesis or androgen insensitivity syndrome. In the case of m&uuml;llerian agenesis, the circulating testosterone is in the normal range for women, and in the case of androgen insensitivity, the circulating testosterone is in the male range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-amenorrhea#H272347094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'M&uuml;llerian agenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-amenorrhea#H272347181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the FSH is normal, breast development is present, and the ultrasound detects blood in the uterus (hematometra) or vagina (hematocolpos), an obstructed outflow tract is present.

This could include distinguishing between constitutional delay of puberty and congenital GnRH deficiency, or investigating some of the common causes of secondary amenorrhea that also cause primary amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are several unique causes of primary amenorrhea, all causes of secondary amenorrhea can also cause primary disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>). Thus, the following questions should be asked of a woman with primary amenorrhea:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has she completed other stages of puberty, including a growth spurt, development of axillary and pubic hair, apocrine sweat glands, and breast development? Lack of pubertal development suggests deficient estradiol secretion, which could be due to a hypothalamic or pituitary disorder, ovarian failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a chromosomal abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a family history of delayed or absent puberty (suggesting a possible familial disorder)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the woman's height relative to family members? Short stature may indicate Turner syndrome or growth hormone deficiency due to hypothalamic-pituitary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were neonatal and childhood health normal? Neonatal crisis suggests congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Alternatively, poor health may be a manifestation of hypothalamic-pituitary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any symptoms of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism) or virilization? The presence of acne or hirsutism is consistent with a diagnosis of PCOS, while virilization suggests more severe androgen excess, due to an androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumor, or 5-alpha-reductase deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been stress; change in weight, diet, or exercise habits; or illness that might result in hypothalamic amenorrhea?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is she taking any drugs that might cause or be associated with amenorrhea? The medication may be taken for a systemic illness that itself can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea (eg, sarcoidosis). Alternatively, drugs such as heroin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> can decrease GnRH and, therefore, gonadotropin secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she have galactorrhea, which would suggest excess prolactin? This could be caused by hypothalamic or pituitary disease or by drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and antipsychotic drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there symptoms of other hypothalamic-pituitary disease, including headaches, visual field defects, fatigue, or polyuria and polydipsia?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single most important step in the evaluation is to determine by physical examination (or ultrasonography if needed) if a uterus is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, the vagina and cervix should be examined for anatomic abnormalities. Anatomic abnormalities that can cause primary amenorrhea include an intact hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or vaginal agenesis, also known as m&uuml;llerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which refers to congenital absence of the vagina with variable uterine development. It is usually accompanied by cervical and uterine agenesis; however, 7 to 10 percent of women have a normal but obstructed or rudimentary uterus with functional endometrium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other findings on physical examination that can provide clues to the etiology of the amenorrhea include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast development, as assessed by Tanner staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67072\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67072 \">figure 1</a>).

The blood pressure should be measured in both arms if Turner syndrome is suspected because it is associated with an increased incidence of coarctation of the aorta.

If the vagina cannot be penetrated with a small cotton swab (Q-tip) or finger, rectal examination may allow evaluation of the internal organs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589991674\"><span class=\"h4\">Pelvic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a normal vagina or uterus is not obviously present on physical examination, pelvic ultrasonography should be performed to confirm the presence or absence of ovaries, uterus, and cervix. In addition, ultrasonography can be useful to look for vaginal or cervical outlet obstruction in patients with amenorrhea and cyclic pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All women with primary amenorrhea should have serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), FSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin (PRL) measured, similar to the approach for women with secondary amenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>). Some clinicians suggest additional testing, including serum estradiol (E2) to assess estrogen status and thyroxine (T4) to look for central hypothyroidism.<strong> </strong>However, serum E2 measurements may be variable in women with either early ovarian failure or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea during recovery, and they may not reflect exposure to estradiol over weeks. On the other hand, E2 can be helpful when trying to interpret FSH values. We measure T4 only when central hypothyroidism is suspected.</p><p>Additional testing depends upon the results of the physical exam; in particular, whether m&uuml;llerian structures are present or absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589991801\"><span class=\"h3\">Further evaluation based upon initial findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272348145\"><span class=\"h4\">Uterus present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with primary amenorrhea have a uterus; most of these have chromosomal abnormalities causing gonadal dysgenesis (ovarian insufficiency due to the premature depletion of all oocytes and follicles). For women with a uterus, further evaluation is determined by the initial lab results (most importantly FSH, and sometimes PRL or TSH), the presence or absence of breast development (usually a marker of ovarian function, except in the case of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome), and the presence or absence of any anatomic abnormalities on physical exam that suggest an outflow tract disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1622419641\"><span class=\"h5\">High FSH</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration is indicative of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; premature ovarian failure). A karyotype is then required and may demonstrate complete or partial deletion of the X chromosome (Turner syndrome) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of Y chromatin. The presence of a Y chromosome material (SRY) is associated with a higher risk of gonadal tumors and makes gonadectomy mandatory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

As examples, congenital heart disease, hypertension, and hearing loss are common in women with Turner syndrome. Although 46,XX spontaneous POI typically presents as secondary amenorrhea, it can sometimes present as primary amenorrhea. If the etiology is thought to be autoimmune, additional evaluation for autoimmune thyroid and adrenal disease should be done.

The characteristic findings are elevations in serum progesterone (&gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> and deoxycorticosterone and low values for serum 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (&lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Although uncommon, all of these disorders can cause primary amenorrhea, including hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, and PCOS. A high serum prolactin should be repeated once to confirm hyperprolactinemia prior to performing pituitary MRI. Hypothyroidism as a cause of hyperprolactinemia should be ruled out by measuring serum TSH.

Constitutional delay of puberty is very uncommon in girls and is a diagnosis of exclusion. For girls with primary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who are undergoing evaluation for hypothalamic or pituitary disease, a serum T4 and TSH should be drawn to look for central hypothyroidism. The evaluation of both disorders is reviewed in detail separately.

Examples include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease. We therefore suggest measurement of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) to rule out diabetes mellitus and serologic screening for celiac disease with immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA).

The etiology of the primary amenorrhea will determine the type of surgical procedure required. As an example, surgical correction of a vaginal outlet obstruction is necessary as soon as the diagnosis is made after menarche to allow passage of menstrual blood. Creation of a neovagina for patients with m&uuml;llerian failure is usually delayed until the women are emotionally mature and ready to participate in the postoperative care required to maintain vaginal patency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of congenital uterine anomalies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In those patients in whom Y chromosomal material is found, gonadectomy should be performed to prevent the development of gonadal neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Gonadectomy is now typically delayed until after puberty in patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, but this was not true in the past. These patients have a normal pubertal growth spurt and feminize at the time of expected puberty; tumors do not usually develop until after this time.

For young women, the benefits and risks of hormone therapy are markedly different than those for a 50-year-old woman. In general, in women of reproductive age with hypoestrogenism, hormone replacement is important to prevent bone loss and to prevent the potential excess risk of premature coronary heart disease.

For women who want to continue to exercise or are unable to improve their nutritional health, estrogen-progestin replacement therapy should be given to those not seeking fertility as it has been demonstrated to improve bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hormonal contraceptives do not appear to provide the same benefit. For women who desire regular menses, cyclic estrogen-progestin treatment, often in the form of a contraceptive formulation, can be prescribed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who want to become pregnant can be treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (not available in United States at this time, available in Europe), but increased caloric intake is simpler and clearly preferable. Furthermore, if a woman does not eat enough to have regular cycles and normal fertility, her nutrient intake during a hormonally induced pregnancy is likely to remain inadequate, increasing the probability of having a newborn who has a low weight for gestational age at birth.

For women who want to become pregnant, either exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH can be given. In a retrospective comparative study, pulsatile GnRH produced a higher rate of conception (96 versus 72 percent) and a lower rate of higher-order multiple gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

For women with a uterus, further evaluation is determined by the initial lab results (prolactin [PRL], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], and, most importantly, FSH), the presence or absence of breast development (a marker of ovarian function, except in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome), and the presence or absence of any anatomic abnormalities on physical exam that suggest an outflow tract disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef106752 \">algorithm 1</a>).
