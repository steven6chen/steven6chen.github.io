The purpose is to assess the probability that mechanical ventilation can be successfully discontinued. Weaning may involve either an immediate shift from full ventilatory support to a period of breathing without assistance from the ventilator or a gradual reduction in the amount of ventilator support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Weaning has also been referred to as the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation or liberation from the mechanical ventilator.</p><p/><p>Patients who wean successfully have less morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization than patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation or the reinstitution of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The most successful weaning strategies include a daily assessment of the patient's readiness to wean and the careful use of sedatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Weaning methods are reviewed here. Assessment of a patient's readiness to wean and the extubation process are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17990496\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A WEANING METHOD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393534911\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional methods of weaning include spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), progressive decreases in the level of pressure support during pressure support ventilation (PSV), and progressive decreases in the number of ventilator-assisted breaths during intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). Newer weaning methods include computer-driven automated PSV weaning and early extubation with immediate use of post-extubation noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). (See <a href=\"#H33900382\" class=\"local\">'Automated weaning'</a> below.)</p><p>Daily SBTs with inspiratory pressure augmentation is our preferred method of weaning. An SBT refers to a patient spontaneously breathing through the endotracheal tube (ETT) for a set period of time (usually 30 minutes to two hours) either without any ventilator support (eg, through a T-piece (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76022 \">figure 1</a>)) or with minimal ventilator support. Methods of minimal ventilator support for an SBT include a low level of PSV (eg, inspiratory pressure augmentation of 5 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), automatic tube compensation (ATC), or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A successful SBT is one where a patient passes a number of pre-set physiologic criteria (eg, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, gas exchange) at completion of the SBT that potentially indicate candidacy for extubation. (See <a href=\"#H5553351\" class=\"local\">'Identifying weaning success'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient successfully passes an SBT and no contraindication to extubation is present, the ETT is typically removed. (See <a href=\"#H5553376\" class=\"local\">'Deciding whether to extubate'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient fails an SBT, then the patient is typically not extubated and a work up for weaning failure is performed. (See <a href=\"#H5553436\" class=\"local\">'Weaning failure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Our preference for SBTs as the initial weaning strategy for most patients with acute respiratory failure is based upon clinical experience and empirical studies, which indicate that compared to other weaning methods, SBTs are simple, efficient, safe, and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 546 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 416 patients (76 percent) underwent a successful SBT using a T-piece [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among these patients, the majority (82 percent) were successfully extubated within 24 hours. The 130 patients whose SBT was unsuccessful were randomly assigned to wean via daily SBTs (using a T-piece), or via IMV or PSV. Patients undergoing daily SBTs were more likely to wean successfully than those who were weaned by IMV or PSV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57273\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57273 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial, 300 patients receiving mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned to receive a daily SBT (via T-piece or 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of CPAP) or usual care (weaning at the discretion of the attending physician) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The daily SBT group had both a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (4.5 versus 6 days) and fewer complications of respiratory failure (20 versus 41 percent). Complications of respiratory failure included reintubation, tracheostomy, or prolonged mechanical ventilation.</p><p/><p>Evidence from low quality randomized trials and meta-analyses suggest that although no single SBT method (ie, T-piece, low level of PSV, ATC, or CPAP) is clearly superior to the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>], SBT with low levels of PSV (ie, inspiratory pressure augmentation) is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In most patients any of these methods is sufficient. Exceptions may include patients with small ETTs (size &le;7 mm) where, compared to a T-piece or CPAP, the use of low levels of PSV or ATC may be useful in overcoming the added work of breathing imposed by the resistance of the ETT. An additional advantage of using PSV, ATC, or CPAP is that they allow the ventilator's monitoring system and alarms to alert the clinician about significant changes in respiratory rate or minute ventilation, whereas a T-piece does not provide this information. In contrast, patients at risk for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and patients with obstructive lung disease may show falsely reassuring SBTs in the presence of CPAP, which improves cardiac output when cardiac filling pressures are elevated and reduces work of breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, despite these theoretical advantages, no clinically meaningful benefit (eg, mortality) has been shown in unselected patients in association with one specific method as demonstrated by the following studies (see <a href=\"#H2991186\" class=\"local\">'Overcoming endotracheal tube resistance'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-piece versus low level PSV &ndash; In one meta-analysis of generally low quality studies that compared SBTs using PSV or a T-piece in 935 mechanically ventilated patients, SBTs with PSV were associated with similar rates of weaning success, reintubation, pneumonia, length of stay, and ICU mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In contrast, another meta-analysis of four randomized trials reported that SBT with PSV resulted in a higher rate of successful extubation at 48 hours (85 versus 77 percent) when compared with T-piece and was associated with an insignificant reduction in ICU mortality (12 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Limitations to both analyses include lack of blinding and significant heterogeneity among the populations studied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-piece versus CPAP &ndash; A randomized trial compared SBTs using a T-piece to SBTs using 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O CPAP and found no differences in the reintubation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-piece versus ATC &ndash; SBTs using a T-piece were compared to SBTs using ATC in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were no differences in weaning success, which was defined as discontinuation of mechanical ventilation without the need for reintubation or NPPV within 48 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ATC versus CPAP &ndash; A randomized trial compared SBTs using ATC to SBTs using CPAP and found no difference in the rate of reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ATC versus PSV &ndash; SBTs using ATC were compared to SBTs using PSV in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There were no differences in the rate of reintubation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2991186\"><span class=\"h2\">Overcoming endotracheal tube resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for performing an SBT with minimal ventilator support (eg, ATC, low level pressure support, or CPAP) rather than without ventilator support (eg, T-piece) is that the additional support may overcome the resistance created by the ETT. After intubation, the lumen of the endotracheal tube may narrow considerably, causing resistance equivalent to that of a tube one to four times smaller [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It has been postulated that the increased work of breathing imposed by the resistance of the ETT may contribute to weaning intolerance. However, clinical studies in heterogeneous populations of mechanically ventilated patients (ie, not restricted to patients with a small, high resistance ETT) have produced mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized crossover trial of 22 patients who had been mechanically ventilated for an average of four days, there were no differences in the work of breathing during SBTs using a T-piece, low level pressure support, or CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In fact, the work of breathing was higher after removal of the ETT than with any of the SBT methods, indicating that either the resistance of the ETT is negligible or the resistance created by an inflamed upper airway due to intubation can be greater than the resistance of the ETT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These findings were supported by an observational study of 14 patients who had been mechanically ventilated for an average of seven days, which found that the work of breathing was the same through a T-piece and following extubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>These studies do not give insight into the problem of imposed work as only patients tolerating an SBT were studied. Investigators who have focused on patients with signs of weaning intolerance have found that the imposed work of breathing is a major contributor to failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In a study of patients failing a 30 minute T-piece trial, immediate conversion to PSV at 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O for an additional 30 minutes resulted in weaning success in 21 of 31 patients (68 percent), suggesting that the endotracheal tube can contribute to iatrogenic weaning failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2991207\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of a weaning trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of an SBT is unknown but typically ranges from 30 minutes to two hours. In general, an initial SBT of 30 minutes duration is considered sufficient to determine whether mechanical ventilation can be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. For patients who fail their initial SBT, longer trials of up to two hours may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. For patients who are mechanically ventilated for more prolonged periods (eg, more than 10 days), we prefer SBTs of longer duration (eg, two hours), although randomized trials in this population are lacking. &#160;</p><p>A prolonged SBT does not appear to be superior to a shorter SBT (ie, 30 minutes) as demonstrated by one multicenter trial that randomly assigned 526 patients receiving mechanical ventilation to undergo SBTs using a T-piece for either 30 or 120 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The rates of weaning failure and re-intubation were virtually identical in both groups, suggesting that<strong> </strong>a 30 minute SBT is sufficient to determine whether mechanical ventilation can be discontinued. However, this trial included few patients mechanically ventilated for more than ten days. Thus, it is unknown if 30 minutes is an adequate test for patients who have failed their first SBT or for those who are mechanically ventilated for more prolonged periods.</p><p>The optimal SBT duration may depend upon the duration of mechanical ventilation, the underlying cause for respiratory failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the clinical context. As an example, patients who have failed an initial SBT and patients with chronic respiratory failure who have undergone an extended duration of mechanical ventilation may warrant a longer SBT to ensure that they are ready for independent breathing. In support of this approach, one study of 75 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were ventilated for 15 or more days, the median time to SBT failure was 120 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5553351\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING WEANING SUCCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the weaning strategy used, the clinician must determine whether weaning was a success or failure. Objective criteria that may indicate weaning failure include tachypnea, respiratory distress (use of accessory muscles, thoracoabdominal paradox, and diaphoresis), hemodynamic changes (tachycardia, hypertension), oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and changes in mental status (somnolence, agitation). Examples of criteria used to identify failed weaning attempts in clinical trials include development of a heart rate greater than 140 beats per minute (or a sustained increase of greater than 20 percent), a respiratory rate greater than 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute,</span> a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or less than 90 mmHg, a pulse oxygen saturation less than 90 percent, PaO<sub>2</sub> less than 50 mmHg, pH less than 7.32, marked diaphoresis, or agitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33</a>]. However, clinicians should also use their clinical judgement at the bedside and not rely solely on these parameters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5553376\"><span class=\"h1\">DECIDING WHETHER TO EXTUBATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If it is determined that weaning was successful, the decision must be made about whether to remove the endotracheal tube (ETT). This requires an assessment of whether the patient can protect their airway (ie, has a sufficient cough and adequate level of consciousness), the volume of respiratory secretions, and whether the airway is patent (ie, a cuff leak is present). These issues and the extubation procedure itself are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5553436\"><span class=\"h1\">WEANING FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of weaning failure should always be sought. Common causes include the underlying source of the respiratory failure not being fully corrected (with an imbalance between work of breathing and respiratory muscle capacity), volume overload, cardiac dysfunction, neuromuscular weakness, delirium, anxiety, metabolic disturbances, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adrenal insufficiency. Once the likely cause of weaning failure has been identified, it should be corrected and then weaning resumed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult-to-wean adult patient in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal weaning strategy following initial weaning failure is uncertain due to conflicting data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 546 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, the 130 patients who failed an initial spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were randomly assigned to future weaning via SBTs once daily, SBTs several times daily, pressure support ventilation (PSV), or intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The SBTs were performed using a T-piece or CPAP. Patients undergoing once daily SBTs were more likely to wean successfully than those who were weaned by IMV or PSV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57273\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57273 \">table 1</a>). There was no difference in weaning success when SBTs once daily were compared to SBTs several times daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, in another trial of 456 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 109 patients failed an initial SBT and were randomly assigned to future weaning via SBTs, PSV, or IMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The SBTs were performed using a T-piece. The weaning duration was significantly shorter with a PSV wean (mean 5.7 days) than with either SBTs (mean 8.5 days) or an IMV wean (mean 9.9 days).</p><p/><p>These studies clearly demonstrate that IMV should not be used for weaning. This is in accord with physiologic studies demonstrating that the degree of respiratory muscle rest on IMV is not proportional to the level of ventilatory support. The neuromuscular apparatus poorly adapts to changing loads because respiratory muscle contraction during lower levels of IMV is similar during both intervening (ie, unsupported) and mandatory (ie, supported) breaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This effect can be overcome by adding PSV to the unsupported breaths during synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The different outcomes in the two trials are probably related to the different ways in which the SBTs were performed during the trials. In the first trial, patients were extubated if they tolerated a two hour SBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The patients were unlikely to develop respiratory muscle fatigue because they were closely monitored and returned to full ventilatory support at the first sign of distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In contrast, in the second trial, clinicians could request up to three separate SBTs over a 24 hour period, each lasting two hours, before deciding whether to extubate a patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is possible that these very prolonged SBTs using a T-piece resulted in fatigue, a process that can take 24 or more hours to reverse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61693 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In other words, respiratory fatigue may have slowed the progress of patients weaned via SBTs in the second trial.</p><p>In our clinical practices, we favor once daily SBTs to wean patients who have failed an initial weaning attempt. However, we return the patients to a supportive mode of mechanical ventilation after a failed SBT, look for and correct reversible causes of weaning intolerance, and reassess their readiness to wean the next day.</p><p>A strategy of extubation with the immediate application of NPPV has been studied in patients with acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and appears promising. In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (530 patients), extubation to NPPV following a failed SBT reduced mortality (RR 0.55, 95 CI 0.38 to 0.79), ventilator associated pneumonia (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.45), the duration of mechanical ventilation (-5.64 days, 95% CI -9.50 to -1.77), and the need for tracheostomy (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04, 0.75), without an increased rate of reintubation (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. We believe that this approach may be considered in patients with COPD or chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure who do not have difficult airways, excessive secretions, or an impaired mental status, but further studies in other patient populations are necessary before it becomes a part of routine clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3042280\"><span class=\"h1\">WEANING PROTOCOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have shown that clinicians are often overly cautious about initiating weaning such that intensive care unit staff typically require protocol-specific training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/6,8,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,39-42</a>]. This exposes patients to unnecessarily prolonged mechanical ventilation and its associated risks. Manual daily screening protocols and automated systems have been recommended to identify a patient&rsquo;s readiness for weaning as well as their ability to undergo a weaning trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/17,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;, section on 'Approach to readiness testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33900376\"><span class=\"h2\">Manual protocolized weaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weaning protocols promote the application of evidence-based weaning strategies, most of which incorporate a manual daily screen, to identify patients that are ready to be weaned from mechanical ventilation, followed by a weaning trial. Multiple studies have demonstrated that weaning protocols are beneficial when compared with usual care, such that most intensive care units have incorporated them into routine care for mechanically ventilated patients. </p><p>The benefit of protocolized weaning was illustrated by a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials (1971 patients), which found that they reduced the mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 25 percent, without increasing adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, weaning protocols have not been shown to be superior to usual care in highly staffed, closed ICUs in an academic hospital, suggesting that they may not be beneficial in all settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This indicates that weaning protocols must be tailored to the patient population to which they will be applied. As an example, a protocol that exclusively focused on determining readiness to wean and conducting SBTs did not improve outcome in neurologic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], but adding a neurologic assessment led to a reduction in the need for reintubation among neurological patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing#H15357733\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;, section on 'Daily screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33900382\"><span class=\"h2\">Automated weaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proprietary computerized, closed loop weaning software packages are available that automate weaning by pressure support. The automated weaning program adjusts levels of pressure support to keep patients in a normal range of intermittently-monitored respiratory rate, tidal volume, and exhaled carbon dioxide. Once a patient is stable at a specific level of pressure support, the program automatically reduces the pressure support level and reassesses respiratory stability. Small randomized trials have shown mixed results when comparing manual protocols to automated weaning systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. </p><p>One meta-analysis of 21 randomized studies (1676 patients) reported reductions in the time spent on mechanical ventilation (10 percent) and ICU length of stay (8 percent) with the use of automated weaning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. There was no difference in mortality rates or hospital length of stay. Although substantial heterogeneity among studies hampered the analysis, the benefits applied to medical, not surgical, patients and possibly to the use of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Smartcare/PS</span> automated system. Data were insufficient in the pediatric population for meaningful analysis. Similar results were shown in additional meta-analyses that included adults only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. </p><p>No trial found any harm associated with automated weaning. However, not every patient is suitable for automated weaning. As an example, patients whose baseline arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is greater than the target range of the weaning software (usually less than 60 mmHg) should not be weaned by automated systems. In addition, the lack of benefit in surgical populations suggests that automated systems are not necessary in patients where extubation might reasonably be expected within a short period of time (eg, 1 to 2 days) following surgery. Thus, there is a need for adequately powered, multi-center randomized trials in adults and children before automated systems can be routinely used in ICU to wean patients off of mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing#H15357740\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;, section on 'Automated readiness testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weaning is the process of decreasing the amount of support that the patient receives from the mechanical ventilator, so the patient assumes a greater proportion of the ventilatory effort. The purpose is to assess the probability that mechanical ventilation can be successfully discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional methods of weaning include spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), progressive decreases in the level of pressure support during pressure support ventilation (PSV), and progressive decreases in the number of ventilator-assisted breaths during intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). An SBT refers to a patient breathing through the endotracheal tube either without any ventilator support (eg, through a T-piece) or with minimal ventilator support (eg, a low level of pressure support, automatic tube compensation [ATC], or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]). (See <a href=\"#H17990496\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a weaning method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it has been determined that a patient is ready to be weaned, we suggest weaning via once-daily SBTs, rather than PSV or IMV (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17990496\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a weaning method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, the SBT may be performed with low level inspiratory pressure support (eg, 5 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). However, appropriate alternatives include SBT using pressure support with ATC or CPAP (eg, &le;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) or SBT using a T-piece. For patients with a small, high resistance endotracheal tube (size &le;7 mm), we suggest using low level pressure support or ATC, rather than a T-piece or CPAP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17990496\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a weaning method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial SBT of 30 minutes duration is generally sufficient to determine whether mechanical ventilation can be discontinued. For patients who fail their initial SBT, or required prolonged mechanical ventilation prior to the initial SBT (eg, more than ten days), we suggest that subsequent trials be 120 minutes, rather than 30 minutes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17990496\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a weaning method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weaning by progressive decreases in the level of pressure support (2 to 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O per day) during PSV is a reasonable alternative for patients who do not tolerate SBTs. We suggest that IMV alone NOT be used for weaning (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5553436\" class=\"local\">'Weaning failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are NOT in highly staffed, closed ICUs in an academic hospital, we recommend using a weaning protocol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients who are in highly staffed, closed ICUs in an academic hospital, we suggest using a weaning protocol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3042280\" class=\"local\">'Weaning protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical impression determines whether a patient fails or tolerates weaning. Patients who tolerate the SBT should be considered for extubation. In contrast, patients who fail the SBT should be returned to mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H5553351\" class=\"local\">'Identifying weaning success'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5553376\" class=\"local\">'Deciding whether to extubate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5553436\" class=\"local\">'Weaning failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient fails weaning, the reason for failure should be sought and corrected. Meanwhile, the patient should be assessed daily for readiness to wean. We suggest weaning such patients via once-daily SBTs, rather than SBTs multiple times daily, PSV, or IMV (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
