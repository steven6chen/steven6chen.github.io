It can occur as an isolated finding or in combination with other congenital defects. VSD can also be an acquired disorder, occurring after acute myocardial infarction or chest wall trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The echocardiographic evaluation of VSD will be reviewed here. Alternative imaging modalities for assessing VSDs, as well as the pathophysiology and clinical features of this defect, are discussed separately.

Echocardiographic evaluation of VSDs includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the location of defects on the septum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing the number of defects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delineation of associated anatomic features</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the size and hemodynamic significance of the defects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidance of interventional and surgical treatment</p><p/><p>The septum is a complex curved surface; traditionally careful assessment using multiple two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic planes has been used to define the location and extension of defects. Although defects are generally described as membranous, muscular, supracristal, and inlet, a single VSD may not be confined to any one region of the septum but may extend into multiple adjacent regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55308\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55308 \">figure 1</a>). Additionally, multiple defects in one or more regions of the septum may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Color flow Doppler is a very useful adjunctive method to search and screen for VSDs. This modality can be used to help localize and confirm the presence of VSDs by their characteristic flow patterns.</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography can also be used to define the anatomy of VSDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. 3D echocardiography allows localization of the defect and defining its relationship to other cardiac structures, and is superior to 2D imaging in delineating the shape and size of the VSD(s). This information is particularly important in choosing candidates and selecting devices for catheter based closure of defects, and in the management of muscular ventricular septal defects in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=three-dimensional-echocardiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Three-dimensional echocardiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the increasing availability of real-time 3D echocardiography and the expanding field of interventional and hybrid procedures for treatment of VSDs, echocardiography has an essential role in both the catheterization and surgical suites. Like 2D imaging, 3D echocardiography can be performed either from a transthoracic or transesophageal approach. In the catheterization laboratory, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used to guide the positioning of sheaths, wires, and devices, and for confirmation of appropriate position and adequacy of closure post device deployment. In the operating room, positioning may be guided by TEE or direct visualization and is used for the assessment of device position and defect closure post deployment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61269\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61269 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72636\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72636 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81090\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef81090 \">movie 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

Sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthesia may be required for optimal results in young children. TEE decreases the likelihood of difficulties with suboptimal acoustic windows and presents fewer logistic challenges in the course of operative and catheter-based procedures. Current TEE probes with 3D imaging capabilities are recommended for use in adults and in children over 30 kg, thereby excluding their use in a significant portion of the pediatric population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Membranous VSD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defects in the membranous septum are located at the intersection of the trabecular, inlet, and outlet regions of the septum, situated just apical to the aortic valve and beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. In the parasternal long axis echocardiographic view, these defects are seen just below the aortic valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50069\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50069 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71163\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef71163 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105727\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105727 \">movie 4</a>). In the orthogonal short axis views of the left ventricular outflow tract, perimembranous defects can be seen beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67557\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67557 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55781\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55781 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105727\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105727 \">movie 4</a>).</p><p>Membranous defects can also be seen beneath the aortic valve in apical imaging planes by angling the transthoracic transducer anteriorly toward the aortic outflow tract. In smaller patients with good subcostal imaging windows, the boundaries of these defects are imaged well in the coronal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70762\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70762 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58967\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58967 \">movie 6</a>) and sagittal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71248\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71248 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58494\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58494 \">movie 7</a>) views of the membranous septum.</p><p>Membranous defects may close spontaneously, either partially or completely, due to apposition of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. In some cases, septal apposition results in an &quot;aneurysm of the ventricular septum,&quot; which is best seen in the parasternal long and short axis views but can be appreciated from multiple windows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64179\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64179 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51322\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51322 \">movie 8</a>). Color flow Doppler mapping is useful for establishing the presence of residual shunt flow through the &quot;aneurysm.&quot; Aneurysm formation most frequently begins in early infancy and may be associated with a decrease in size or spontaneous closure of even relatively large defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A number of associated findings may be seen with membranous VSDs, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double chambered right ventricle, which refers to hypertrophy of the muscle bundles between the inlet and outlet portions of the right ventricle, resulting in mid chamber obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52909\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52909 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76939\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76939 \">movie 9</a>). These muscle bundles are particularly well seen in subcostal coronal and sagittal images, but may also be seen in parasternal short axis imaging in larger patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'RV outflow obstruction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular to right atrial shunt (via Gerbode defect), which may be demonstrated by two dimensional imaging, but is usually first suggested by color flow mapping demonstrating a high velocity jet originating in the crux of the heart in parasternal short axis, apical four chamber, or subcostal coronal images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53279\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53279 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73264\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73264 \">movie 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subaortic ridge and associated subaortic stenosis, which is an uncommon finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nevertheless, the left ventricular outflow tract should be carefully evaluated in parasternal long axis and apical images to rule out this abnormality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscular defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defects in the muscular septum are often multiple, especially if they are a complication of a myocardial infarction, and may be associated with defects in other regions of the septum. Color flow Doppler mapping is invaluable for detecting smaller defects that may be difficult to identify within the trabeculations of the right ventricle when only 2D transthoracic imaging is used; defects in the apical septum are the most likely to be missed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75405\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75405 \">image 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62574\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef62574 \">movie 11</a>). The septum should be interrogated carefully by sweeping the transducer from the right ventricular inflow to the left ventricular outflow tract in long axis and subcostal coronal images, sweeping through serial sections of the ventricle from apex to base in parasternal and parasagittal short axis imaging planes, and by sweeping from posterior to anterior in apical views.</p><p>Color flow Doppler mapping is very helpful for identifying muscular defects, even at suboptimal angles of interrogation. However, in patients with increased right ventricular pressure, the color flow patterns for the flow velocity across these and all other types of VSDs become less apparent, decreasing the sensitivity of Doppler for their detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Supracristal defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supracristal defects, sometimes referred to as subpulmonic or subpulmonary defects, are located caudal to the pulmonary valve and cephalad to the crista supraventricularis. Although they may be difficult to distinguish from membranous defects in the parasternal long axis view of 2D transthoracic echocardiography, they are often easily identified beneath the pulmonary valve in the parasternal short axis images obtained at the level of the arterial roots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63591\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63591 \">image 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54870\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef54870 \">movie 12</a>). In younger patients, the relationship between the defect and the pulmonic valve can also be seen in the subcostal sagittal view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56498\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56498 \">image 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76408\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76408 \">movie 13</a>).</p><p>Prolapse of the unsupported right coronary cusp of the aortic valve into the defect may occur with supracristal VSDs and occasionally with perimembranous defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Associated prolapse of the noncoronary cusp occurs less commonly, may be associated with more significant aortic insufficiency and may be associated with a higher risk of failure of surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Prolapse of the leaflet into the defect is best observed in parasternal and subcostal long axis, and apical views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82621\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82621 \">image 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69288\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef69288 \">movie 14</a>). Although it can be difficult to appreciate the prolapse by transthoracic echocardiography, it is readily seen with TEE. Aortic valve regurgitation may occur with leaflet prolapse due to the progressive distortion of the leaflet; this distortion may be seen in parasternal short axis views of the aortic valve leaflets. The right coronary cusp deformation index and right coronary cusp imbalance indices may be used to quantify the degree of deformation. These indices correlate with the severity of aortic valve regurgitation and may be used in decisions regarding surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inlet defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inlet defects occur at the crux of the heart, posterior and inferior to membranous and outlet defects, and at the junction of the atrioventricular valves. Similar to other VSDs, inlet defects may be seen in many transthoracic echocardiographic imaging planes; however, these defects and their characteristic relationship to the atrioventricular valves are best demonstrated in apical and subcostal coronal views. The location of these defects in the posterior septum can be well seen in the parasternal short axis view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67011\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67011 \">image 13</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58066\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58066 \">movie 15</a>).</p><p>The relationship of the atrioventricular valves to the VSD must be carefully assessed. Tricuspid valve chordal attachments commonly insert on the crest or right ventricular surface of the septum. Anomalous chordal attachments of the mitral valve may also insert on the septum. In addition, either atrioventricular valve may straddle the defect, with chordal attachments crossing the defect and attaching anomalously on the septum or free wall of the opposite ventricle, complicating approaches to repair of the defect. It is important to assure that two atrioventricular valves are present, since these inlet VSDs may be part of a larger endocardial cushion defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Malalignment defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of the relationship between the components of the ventricular septum and the atrial and ventricular septa must be included in the evaluation of a VSD. Malalignment defects occur when there is an abnormal relationship between the atrial and ventricular septa or between the individual components of the ventricular septa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overriding and straddling atrioventricular valves are seen when there is malalignment of the atrial and ventricular septa. Malalignment of the conal septum, which partitions the great arteries and the trabecular septum dividing the ventricular chambers, may result in subaortic obstruction when there is posterior deviation of the conal septum. Aortic override with or without subpulmonary stenosis occurs when there is anterior deviation of the conal septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59821\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59821 \">image 14</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81875\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef81875 \">movie 16</a>).

The degree of shunting through a defect is influenced by the size of the defect and by the balance of resistances in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The pressure and volume loads imposed by large VSDs result in elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance. Calculations of the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow <span class=\"nowrap\">(Qp/Qs)</span> have less clinical utility than measurements of right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures, which reflect the effect of the VSD on the pulmonary vascular bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Shunt determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>2D imaging can give important qualitative information about the degree of shunting associated with the VSD. Both left atrial and left ventricular cavity dilation are present in VSDs that produce significant left-to-right shunting. Flow-related increases in transpulmonary and transmitral velocities, assessed by Doppler, may be documented in such lesions, while pulsed Doppler and Doppler color flow mapping can delineate the timing and direction of shunting during the cardiac cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Phase velocity mapping cardiac MRI is another quantitative approach for determining the pulmonic to systemic flows. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Congenital heart disease'</a>.)</p><p>In most individuals, left-to-right shunting predominates in mid and late diastole and throughout systole, while right-to-left shunting, which may not be clinically significant, is commonly seen in early diastole. However, with evolving pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular disease, right-to-left shunting may occur in early and mid diastole, and even in late systole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Potential sources of error in this measurement include the limitations of lateral resolution in measurement of vessels and valve orifices, changes in the size of these structures during the cardiac cycle, suboptimal angle of Doppler interrogation, and the presence of turbulence in the pulmonary artery obscuring the Doppler outflow signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In the absence of coexistent right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, large gradients are seen in patients with smaller VSDs and low right ventricular pressures, and small gradients are seen in patients with elevated right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures. However, because of differences in the timing of activation of the left and right ventricles, this method may underestimate right ventricular pressure in some patients, most notably in those with an asymmetric or sloped Doppler waveform, where end systolic or mean gradient Doppler determinations may better reflect the pressure gradient across the ventricular septal defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The common findings of tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation often allow estimation of right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures. Right ventricular systolic pressure can be estimated using the sum of the estimated right atrial pressure and the gradient between the right atrium and right ventricle as derived from the modified Bernoulli equation applied to the peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58936\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58936 \">image 16</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean and end diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures can be derived from analysis of the peak and end diastolic velocities of the pulmonary regurgitation jet, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71753\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71753 \">image 17</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p>In the assessment of VSDs, these measurements of right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures give crucial information regarding patient hemodynamics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

VSD can also be an acquired disorder, such as those occurring after acute myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography is valuable not only in diagnosing VSDs, but also in the percutaneous and surgical treatment of these defects. Echocardiographic evaluation of VSDs includes identification of the number and location of defects, delineation of associated anatomic features, assessment of the size and hemodynamic significance of the defects, and guidance of interventional and surgical treatments. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VSDs may occur in a variety of locations, including the membranous septum, muscular septum, supracristal area, and AV valve inlet area. Optimal echocardiographic imaging of defects in these different areas requires imaging from multiple sites as well as the use of color Doppler imaging. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Membranous VSD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Muscular defects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Supracristal defects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Inlet defects'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to evaluating the anatomy of the VSD and its relationship to other cardiac structures, echocardiography also provides information about the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with the VSD, including the right and left ventricular pressures and the degree of shunting across the defect. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Penny DJ, Vick GW 3rd.
