It also has immunosuppressive properties and is increasingly used for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases, either as a sole agent or in combination with glucocorticoids. Long-term use of cyclophosphamide is associated with a multitude of significant side effects, such as hair loss, leukopenia, hemorrhagic cystitis, infertility, the development of secondary malignancies, and pulmonary toxicity.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> pulmonary toxicity will be presented here. Other toxicities of cyclophosphamide are discussed separately.

The characteristic picture is the presence of atypical cells in the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and interstitial and alveolar edema and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia (also known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia or BOOP), and alveolar hemorrhage have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and a pattern indistinguishable from usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) also can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Lung tissue from different species varies in its ability to locally metabolize cyclophosphamide, and susceptibility to cyclophosphamide-induced lung fibrosis in humans may depend upon genetic differences in local pulmonary drug metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Genetic susceptibility is further supported by the absence of a clear dose-response relationship for the development of lung toxicity in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>In vitro models also suggest the involvement of transforming growth factor-beta in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>-induced pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the exact mechanisms by which cyclophosphamide-induced lung injury causes the observed increase in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression and the associated upregulation of collagen synthesis and irreversible fibrosis remain unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal models and clinical observations suggest that oxidative stress may contribute to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> pulmonary toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Concomitant radiation therapy, use of other cytotoxic agents with known lung toxicity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>), concomitant use of other drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], and exposure to high inspired oxygen concentrations have all been implicated as additional risk factors for the development of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

On the other hand, when cyclophosphamide is given as a conditioning agent prior to bone marrow transplantation, a dose response has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358778829\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclophosphamide</a>-induced pulmonary injury appears to be <strong>rare; the frequency is &lt;1 percent </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the risk may be increased by the concomitant use of radiation therapy, oxygen therapy, or other drugs with potential pulmonary toxicity; these factors also may confound attempts to estimate the true incidence of cyclophosphamide-induced lung injury, and to recognize cyclophosphamide-induced pulmonary toxicity when it develops.</p><p>There are two distinct clinical patterns of pulmonary toxicity associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>: an acute pneumonitis that occurs early in the course of treatment and a chronic, progressive, fibrotic process that may occur after prolonged therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A single case of acute pulmonary edema after intravenous cyclophosphamide also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358778835\"><span class=\"h2\">Early-onset pneumonitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients present with cough and dyspnea within one to six months of starting therapy; fever and fatigue also may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans can show reticular markings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a ground glass appearance.

As an example, five patients with late onset pneumonitis received one to four years of cyclophosphamide therapy and developed lung disease six months to six years after stopping cyclophosphamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical picture is one of relentlessly progressive lung fibrosis. The onset of symptoms is insidious, with slowly progressive dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. This disorder differs from usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) in that clubbing of the fingers and &quot;velcro-type&quot; inspiratory crackles are lacking, and the diffuse reticular or nodular opacities that are observed on chest radiographs do not have the typical bibasilar predominance seen in UIP.

Some patients are asymptomatic, and the disease is suspected because of unexplained radiographic or lung function abnormalities. Late-onset pulmonary toxicity should be suspected when patients with prior or ongoing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> exposure for six months or longer complain of progressively worsening nonproductive cough and dyspnea.

In the case of early-onset pneumonitis, computed tomography (CT) of the chest reveals &quot;ground-glass&quot; opacities predominantly in the periphery of the upper lungs.

The honeycombing pattern characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) is lacking, and the lower lungs are not predominantly affected. Bilateral pleural thickening of the mid- and upper lung regions is a common feature which also helps in differentiating this process from UIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cyclophosphamide-pulmonary-toxicity/abstract/3,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6776609\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main role of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is to exclude other processes such as infection, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or, in patients with a malignant disease, lymphangitic tumor spread.

We typically prescribe systemic glucocorticoid therapy in patients with more severe initial symptoms and impairment on pulmonary function testing.
