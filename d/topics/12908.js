Although parainfluenza viruses are commonly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, their impact in adults is less well characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In adults, parainfluenza viruses usually cause mild upper respiratory infections but can lead to life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The virology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of parainfluenza viruses in adults will be reviewed here. Infection with parainfluenza viruses in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parainfluenza-viruses-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parainfluenza viruses in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the genus <em>Paramyxovirus</em> in the Paramyxoviridae family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This family also includes mumps, measles, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumovirus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parainfluenza virions are pleomorphic, range in diameter from 150 to 200 microns, and contain approximately 15,500 nucleotides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The single strand of negative-sense RNA encodes the following viral proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein (HN), and polymerase (L) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80809\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80809 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, serotype PIV-3 encodes C, D, and V proteins, PIV-1 encodes a C protein, and PIV-2 encodes a V protein.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HN and F proteins project through the lipid envelope and form the major antigenic targets for neutralizing antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nucleocapsid core is composed of N, P, and L proteins in association with viral RNA. N proteins bind tightly to the viral genome, creating a template for the RNA polymerase composed of the P and L proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HN glycoproteins are involved in attachment of the virus to the host cell via interactions with sialic acid residues on the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This interaction allows the F protein to mediate virus-cell membrane fusion, which is required for nucleocapsid entry and infection of the host cell. The neuraminidase portion of the HN protein mediates budding of progeny virions from the surface of infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p>The HN glycoproteins of PIVs are more antigenically stable than those of influenza A viruses. However, the development of antigenic differences over time has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], which may interfere with the production of an effective vaccine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four major serotypes of human PIVs (PIV-1, -2, -3, -4) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. PIV-1 and -3 are members of the <em>Respirovirus</em> genera, whereas PIV-2 and -4 are members of the <em>Rubulavirus</em> genera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The classification of the parainfluenza viruses into two genera is based upon genetic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations vary depending upon the viral serotype, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) initially infect epithelial cells of the nose and oropharynx and then spread distally to the large and small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Significant viral replication occurs in the nose and lungs 24 hours after infection, with viral replication peaking after two to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Viral antigen can be detected in the apical portion of respiratory epithelial cells from days 1 to 6 of infection with a decrease on day 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The extent of infection correlates well with the severity of disease: mild upper respiratory tract infections are associated with limited infection of the nasopharynx, whereas more severe disease involves spread of infection to the large and small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. PIV-1 and PIV-2, which are associated with croup, usually infect the larynx and upper trachea, whereas PIV-3, which is associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, infects the distal airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Pathologic examination of infected tissues in animal models of PIV infection suggests that minimal cellular damage results from direct viral effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As is the case with other respiratory viruses, the host immune response is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The increase in airway responsiveness that is often associated with PIV-3 infection (and other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus) may result from increased stromal interleukin-11 production, enhanced acetylcholine release, and increased release of leukotrienes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are a common cause of respiratory tract infection, and spread within families is extensive, requiring person-to-person contact or large droplet inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. By adulthood, more than 90 percent of individuals have antibodies to PIV, although they are only partially protective against subsequent infection. Even in the presence of high levels of serotype-specific antibodies, primary infection and reinfection can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parainfluenza-viruses-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parainfluenza viruses in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIV infections occur throughout the world and throughout the year, with certain serotypes predominating during the spring or fall. In the United States, PIV-1 usually causes outbreaks biennially during the fall of odd-numbered years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56691 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In contrast, PIV-2 occurs in annual epidemics in the fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. PIV-3 is the least predictable and is endemic, but outbreaks in the spring do occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22</a>]. Seasonal patterns of PIV-4 infections have not been established since the disease is usually mild and the virus is difficult to detect. In tropical countries, parainfluenza viruses do not exhibit seasonal variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Trends in PIV infections in the United States are monitored by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System and can be found on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotype prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIV-3 is the most prevalent serotype in both children and adults and is associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis; bronchiolitis is typically only seen in children. PIV-1 and -2 are detected less frequently in adults and are usually associated with upper respiratory tract infection, although lower tract disease has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/2,7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,26</a>]. PIV-4 usually causes mild upper respiratory tract infection in both adults and children and, because of its rarity, is less well characterized than the other PIVs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>In a surveillance study of PIVs in children and adults in the United States from 1990 to 2004 in which more than 40,000 cases were detected, the serotypes were found in the following proportions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIV-3 &ndash; 52 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIV-1 &ndash; 26 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIV-2 &ndash; 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIV-4 &ndash; 2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncharacterized serotype &ndash; 8 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among adults, PIV infections typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections but can cause pneumonia, particularly in immunocompromised hosts such as hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, patients with leukemia, and, less commonly, solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].

Of the parainfluenza viruses, PIV-3 followed by PIV-1 and -2 are most commonly associated with lower tract disease, whereas PIV-4 is usually associated with mild upper respiratory tract disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>].</p><p>PIV is associated with 1 to 15 percent of acute respiratory illness in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The risk of severe PIV disease is highest among older adult individuals, particularly debilitated nursing home residents.

The highest morbidity and mortality has been described in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, patients with leukemia, and solid organ transplant recipients, particularly lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/27,29,30,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30,44-46</a>]. PIV infections have also been described in HIV-infected individuals and patients with malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/27,31,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,47</a>]. In one study, the mortality rate associated with PIV infection was higher in HIV-infected children than in children without HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Studies of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients have traditionally focused on patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms; this may underestimate the incidence and overestimate the severity of disease caused by PIVs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More recent studies have estimated the incidence of symptomatic PIV infection to be 2 to 7 percent in HCT recipients and approximately 5 percent in lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/27,29,30,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30,49,50</a>].

PIV-3 is the serotype most frequently isolated from immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study that included &gt;3500 HCT recipients at a single center, PIV infections occurred in 253 patients (7 percent) who developed respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. PIV-3 occurred in 90 percent, followed by PIV-1 in 6 percent, PIV-2 in 4 percent, and PIV-4 in one patient. At presentation, 198 of 228 patients (87 percent) with PIV-3 infection had upper respiratory tract involvement only, whereas 13 (6 percent) had evidence of upper and lower tract disease, and 17 (7 percent) had pneumonitis in the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms. Twenty-five patients (13 percent) with upper tract disease progressed to lower tract disease a median of three days after developing upper respiratory tract symptoms. Glucocorticoids were associated in a dose-dependent manner with increased risk of progression from upper to lower tract disease and mortality. Mortality was high: 35 percent at 30 days and 75 percent at 180 days. Pulmonary copathogens were isolated from 29 of 55 patients (53 percent) with PIV-3 pneumonia.</p><p>Another retrospective study evaluated PIV infections in 200 patients who had either undergone HCT or had leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At initial presentation, most patients (70 percent) had only an upper respiratory tract infection, and the remainder (30 percent) had pneumonia. Independent risk factors for progression to pneumonia included neutropenia, an APACHE II score &gt;15, and respiratory coinfections. The overall mortality rate 30 days following diagnosis was 9 percent, whereas the mortality rate among patients with PIV pneumonia was 17 percent. Mortality rates were similar in HCT recipients and in those with leukemia. Independent predictors of death were relapsed or refractory underlying malignancy, APACHE II score &gt;15, and high-dose glucocorticoid use.</p><p>In addition to causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections, PIVs are also associated with asymptomatic shedding among HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a prospective study that followed patients for 100 days following HCT, 17 of 122 individuals (18 percent) were found to have PIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Of these, six individuals had asymptomatic shedding.</p><p>PIV infections among both HCT and lung transplant recipients have been associated with significant short- and long-term pulmonary dysfunction. PIVs have been associated with acute rejection in lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/30,44,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,44,53</a>]. Animal models of a related virus, Sendai virus, suggest that there is a complex interplay between direct viral cytopathic effects and local induction of inflammation that contribute to acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In lung transplant recipients, PIVs, particularly those causing lower tract infection, are associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, a form of chronic rejection in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/30,44,53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,44,53,56,57</a>]. Among HCT recipients, PIV infection is associated with an 18-fold increase in the risk of developing severe airflow decline during the first posttransplant year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with PIV pneumonia, high-resolution chest computed tomography may reveal interstitial infiltrates, ground glass opacities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airspace consolidations, which are indistinguishable from findings noted with other viral and nonviral pathogens. In addition, small peribronchial nodules have been seen in some cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68781\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68781 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Such nodules are not specific for PIV; they may also occur with a variety of other infectious (eg, fungi, bacteria, higher order bacteria such as <em>Nocardia </em>and <em>Actinomyces</em>, viruses) and noninfectious causes. Thus, appropriate studies should be done to rule out alternative pathogens, since bacterial and fungal pathogens often complicate PIV infections in immunocompromised patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical features that are pathognomonic for parainfluenza virus (PIV) infection. Local surveillance for PIV infection is not routinely done (although trends are monitored as part of the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]), and cocirculation with other pathogens makes clinical diagnosis challenging. As a result, microbiologic tests are required when it is important to establish a definitive diagnosis. Since there is no approved specific treatment available for PIV infection, it is not necessary to make a microbiologic diagnosis for most immunocompetent patients.</p><p>Viral culture of nasal washings or swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid has traditionally been the gold standard for diagnosing PIV infection. Antigen detection tests are also commonly used in hospital laboratories, although they have limited sensitivity and are not available as a rapid antigen kit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is becoming increasingly available and has higher sensitivity than either viral culture or antigen detection assays. Serology has a limited role for the diagnosis of PIV infection.</p><p>Nasal washings have a higher sensitivity than nasal swabs for the detection of respiratory viruses, including PIVs, regardless of the method of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. PIVs are stable in viral transport media at 4&ordm;C for up to five days. Samples should not be held at room temperature since the virus loses viability within one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral culture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antigen detection assays are the most common modalities used for the diagnosis of PIV infection. However, given that PCR has higher sensitivity than either of these methods, we favor it for the diagnosis of PIV infection in immunocompromised patients in whom establishing the diagnosis is most important. If available, multiplex PCR has the further advantage of being able to test for multiple possible etiologies simultaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred cell lines for PIV culture are monkey kidney cell lines (eg, LLC-MK2), but commercially available mixed cell culture systems will support growth as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,61</a>]. Hemadsorption inhibition, hemagglutination inhibition, or immunofluorescence is used to identify PIV in culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A centrifugation-enhanced shell vial assay that uses monoclonal antibodies for the detection of PIVs grown in cell culture increases sensitivity and can provide results more quickly than traditional culture techniques, often within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Traditional viral culture typically takes 5 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, culture using the shell vial technique is preferred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No rapid antigen kit is available for the detection of PIVs. However, reagents for the detection of PIV antigen by direct or indirect fluorescence antibody testing of nasal specimens (washings or swabs) or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are available, although the sensitivity is limited, ranging from 70 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,61</a>]. Specificity is at least 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The primary benefit of antigen detection is the ability to establish a diagnosis quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCR has the highest yield for the detection of PIV, particularly in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/49,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,63,64</a>]. Compared with culture, PCR has a sensitivity of 100 percent and a specificity of 95 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p>PCR primers are usually directed toward the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene although they differ among assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,67</a>]. Multiplex PCR assays have been developed that are able to identify and differentiate between a wide variety of respiratory pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. If available, use of multiplex molecular assays applied to nasal swabs or washings or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be used for the diagnosis of infection in immunocompromised patients.</p><p>Drawbacks of PCR are that it is not widely available as an in-house test and it generally takes longer to obtain results compared with antigen detection assays. However, newer commercially available assays may increase local availability over time. Unlike antigen detection tests that can be performed on a sample-by-sample basis, specimens for PCR are usually batched and processed only on certain days in hospital laboratories, whereas sending a sample to a commercial laboratory often results in a minimum of 24 hours for a result to be reported. Caution should be used when using some of the available multiplex molecular assays since reduced sensitivity for some PIV subtypes has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serology is not practical since the diagnosis of PIV infection is usually established by comparing acute and convalescent sera, the latter of which is obtained approximately two weeks following acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Diagnosis by serology requires a fourfold rise in immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer between the acute and convalescent samples or the appearance of an IgM response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no antiviral agents with proven efficacy for parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, the mainstay of therapy for PIV infection in immunocompromised hosts is reduction of immunosuppression, particularly reduction in the dose of glucocorticoid when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Case reports and small case series have shown variable results for the use of aerosolized, oral, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for the treatment of PIV infection in HCT and solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/28,29,74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,74-78</a>]. The largest of these was a retrospective study in which 31 of 55 HCT recipients with PIV pneumonia received aerosolized ribavirin with or without intravenous immunoglobulin; treatment did not reduce viral shedding or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Given the lack of proven benefit with ribavirin or intravenous immunoglobulin, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using these agents.</p><p>Development of effective antiviral agents for the treatment of PIV in immunocompromised hosts is needed. Two hemagglutinin-neuraminidase inhibitors have been developed that have potent in vitro and in vivo activity against PIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. DAS181, a recombinant sialidase fusion protein, has also been shown to inhibit human PIV infection via enzymatic removal of the sialic acid moiety of PIV receptors in cell cultures, human airway epithelial tissue cultures, and in a cotton rat model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In addition, several transplant recipients with severe PIV infection have been given inhaled or nebulized DAS181; treatment was well tolerated and was temporally associated with improvement in symptoms, oxygenation, and pulmonary function, as well as a reduction in PIV viral load from nasopharyngeal specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults/abstract/82-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-85</a>].

In contrast, PIV-2 and PIV-3 occur in annual epidemics in the fall and spring, respectively. In tropical countries, parainfluenza viruses do not exhibit seasonal variation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among immunocompetent adults, PIV infections are usually asymptomatic or mild self-limited upper respiratory tract infections, whereas, in immunocompromised patients, PIV infections cause pneumonia in a substantial proportion, particularly in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.
