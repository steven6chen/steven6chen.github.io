Fewer than 10 percent of these children will have coexisting bacteremia or urosepsis. <em>Escherichia coli</em> causes more than 80 percent of these infections. Clinically, it is not possible to distinguish lower from upper UTI in this age group. A conservative and appropriate approach is to assume pyelonephritis exists among febrile young children with pyuria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Younger children'</a>). Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are obstructing membranous folds within the lumen of the posterior urethra in the newborn male. Male infants with PUV may present with urosepsis associated with findings of failure to thrive, poor urinary stream, straining or grunting while voiding, elevated serum creatinine, and electrolyte abnormalities of chronic kidney disease (eg, metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia). The diagnosis is made by voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) that demonstrates the hallmark findings of a dilated and elongated posterior urethra during the voiding phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62496\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62496 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59938\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59938 \">image 2</a>) when the urethral catheter is no longer present.

The incidence of bacterial meningitis in this age group has been declining because of universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B streptococcal disease and the introduction of conjugate vaccines against <em>Haemophilus influenza</em> type b and pneumococcus.

Pertussis may present as respiratory failure, apnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia, or a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). Symptoms may be nonspecific, including feeding difficulties, tachypnea, and cough. Gagging, vomiting, apnea, cyanosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia often develop during paroxysms of cough.

Clinical suspicion of pertussis in infants, especially those younger than four months should trigger immediate treatment. Laboratory confirmation should <strong>not</strong> delay the initiation of treatment. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment, as well as other precautionary measures, are essential to prevention of transmission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-infants-and-children-treatment-and-prevention#H90991858\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in infants and children: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infant botulism</strong> &ndash; Infants develop botulism from the ingestion of <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> spores (air-borne, soil-borne, or from food), rather than preformed botulinum toxin. The toxin, which impairs impulses at the neuromuscular junction by blocking acetylcholine release, is then produced by organisms that colonize the infant's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The disease is more common among breast-fed infants. Symptoms initially include hypotonia, constipation and poor feeding and progress to respiratory failure. The diagnosis of infant botulism should be suspected in any infant with acute onset of weak suck, ptosis, decreased activity, or constipation. A presumptive diagnosis should be made based upon the clinical presentation and electromyography while confirmatory stool studies are pending. The diagnosis and treatment of infant botulism are discussed in greater detail separately.

As many as one-third of these neonates do not have skin vesicles at presentation, and many are afebrile, making the diagnosis more challenging. Infection is acquired during the birthing process and initial symptoms typically appear in the first month of life. The peak incidence of CNS disease is from 10 to 17 days of life. Those with disseminated infection may have earlier clinical manifestations. HSV infection should be suspected in infants up to six weeks of age although HSV infection is uncommon after 28 days of age.

The infection is most often acquired from a symptomatic mother in the perinatal period. Symptoms typically develop between three and seven days of life. However, approximately one-third of cases have a biphasic illness with a period of one to seven days of apparent well-being interspersed between the initial symptoms and the appearance of more serious manifestations.

Myocarditis in children is usually caused by enteroviruses (coxsackie B group) or adenovirus. Infants may present with a fulminant illness characterized by signs of decreased cardiac output, including hypotension, poor pulses, and decreased perfusion. Malignant arrhythmias are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchiolitis with apnea</strong> &ndash; Young infants, particularly those who are less than one month of age, were born prematurely <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have congenital heart disease, may develop apnea with bronchiolitis. Some may present with severe apnea and ill appearance before they develop typical signs of bronchiolitis, such as respiratory distress or wheezing. Bronchiolitis is diagnosed clinically. Chest radiographs and laboratory studies are not necessary to make the diagnosis of bronchiolitis and should not be routinely performed in stable children. However, they are frequently warranted in ill-appearing infants to confirm the clinical diagnosis and assess for the extent of lung involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H536690659\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Apnea'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Influenza</strong> &ndash; The influenza virus is highly contagious resulting in seasonal epidemics. Influenza-like illness is marked by fever and signs of lower respiratory tract disease, such as coughing. Infants may also present with vomiting, poor feeding, or malaise, and along with the elderly, they suffer the greatest morbidity and mortality from complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Those with significant comorbidities such as prematurity or pulmonary or cardiac diseases are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes. During influenza season, an evaluation for influenza virus infection should be pursued in all ill-appearing febrile infants and laboratory confirmation is warranted.

There is usually no clear history of trauma. Because signs of external injury, such as burns or contusions may be minimal or absent, one must maintain a high-level of suspicion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402 \">table 3</a>). Key diagnostic considerations include involvement of a multidisciplinary child abuse team, obtaining laboratory studies (eg, complete blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and a urinalysis), a skeletal survey, neuroimaging, and eye examination by an ophthalmologist (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664978274\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical conditions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malrotation with volvulus</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Malrotation develops as a result of an arrest of normal rotation of the embryonic gut. Abnormal mobility of the small bowel, as the result of a narrow mesenteric base, allows the mesentery to twist. Volvulus occurs when small bowel twists around the superior mesenteric artery, causing vascular compromise to large portions of the midgut (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78111 \">figure 1</a>). This leads to ischemia and necrosis of the bowel that can quickly become irreversible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vomiting, which is almost always yellow or bilious, occurs in &gt;90 percent of newborns with volvulus and is by far the most common presenting symptom of malrotation in infancy. Abdominal distension and tenderness is typically also present on physical examination. A limited upper GI contrast series is the best diagnostic study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pyloric stenosis</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Hypertrophy of both the circular and longitudinal muscular layers of the pylorus results in obstruction. This is a common condition estimated to occur in about 1 of 300 live births. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients typically come to medical attention at three to six weeks of age with a complaint of progressively worsening projectile, non-bilious emesis. Pyloric stenosis is more common in male infants. A heightened clinical awareness and the liberal use of ultrasound to establish the diagnosis has led to less delay in diagnosis and better outcomes. Thus, the classic presentation with a prolonged duration of vomiting and emaciation accompanied by a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant and a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis on blood chemistries is less common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incarcerated hernia</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>An inguinal hernia develops when intraabdominal contents enter the inguinal canal through a patent processus vaginalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67349 \">figure 2</a>). An incarceration results when the hernia cannot be reduced back into the intraabdominal cavity. Incarceration can rapidly progress to strangulation, in which hernia contents become ischemic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infants with an incarcerated inguinal hernia usually are irritable and crying. Vomiting and abdominal distention may develop, depending on the duration of incarceration and whether or not intestinal obstruction has occurred. Physical examination of children with incarcerated inguinal hernias usually is diagnostic. A firm, discrete inguinal mass, which may extend to the scrotum or labia majora, can be palpated in the groin. The mass usually is tender and often is surrounded by edema with erythema of the overlying skin. The testicle may appear dark blue because of venous congestion caused by pressure on the spermatic cord.

Patients present with symptoms of distal intestinal obstruction: bilious emesis, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium or stool. The diagnosis can be suggested by a delay in passage of the first meconium (greater than 48 hours of age). By 48 hours of life, 100 percent of normal full-term neonates will pass meconium. By contrast, 50 to 90 percent of infants with HD will fail to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life. Thus, passage of stool within the first one to two days of life does not exclude the diagnosis. There may be an explosive expulsion of gas and stool after the digital rectal examination (squirt sign or blast sign), which may relieve the obstruction temporarily. The diagnosis is usually supported by contrast enema or anorectal manometry and is established by rectal biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-aganglionic-megacolon-hirschsprung-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Affected infants may also present initially with enterocolitis, a potentially life-threatening illness in which patients have a sepsis-like picture with fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which can progress to toxic megacolon. Patients with enterocolitis require fluid resuscitation, intravenous antibiotic therapy to cover bowel flora, rectal irrigations, and, in rare cases, an emergency colostomy. A rare complication of HD is volvulus, which can affect the sigmoid and less commonly the transverse colon and cecum.

The appendix is typically perforated at the time of diagnosis among infants. Symptoms are nonspecific and include lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, and vomiting. Infants often have abdominal distension and signs of sepsis, such as hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H599831174\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Neonates (0 to 30 days)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>NEC is characterized by bowel wall necrosis that may lead to perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78676\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78676 \">image 3</a>). It is most common in premature neonates, especially those of very low birth weight. It may rarely occur in full-term infants, usually within the first 10 days of life.

Several categories of IEM may present with an acute metabolic crisis that is triggered by circumstances such as intake of protein or certain carbohydrates or infection such as amino acid disorders, organic acidemias, urea cycle disorders, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid oxidation defects, and mitochondrial disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The deterioration typically occurs after a period of apparent well-being.
