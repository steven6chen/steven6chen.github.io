Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States and worldwide. Tobacco use increases the risk of many acute and chronic diseases, including cancers at many sites.</p><p>The main medications that have demonstrated efficacy as smoking cessation aids include nicotine replacement, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These treatments aim to reduce symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, thereby making it easier to stop using cigarettes. For the general population, the choice among the therapies is based largely on patient preference, with a few notable exceptions for patients with contraindications to certain drugs or comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H2261634639\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients, we suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> or a combination of two nicotine replacement products (a patch plus a short-acting form such as the gum or lozenge) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. Combination NRT consists of using both the nicotine patch (a long-acting form of NRT) and a short-acting NRT of the patient&rsquo;s choice, generally nicotine gum or nicotine lozenge. However, using single-type NRT is a reasonable alternative based on cost, side effect profiles, and patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H13311131\" class=\"local\">'Nicotine replacement therapy'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> appears to be somewhat less effective than combination NRT or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, but it is a reasonable alternative first-line choice if the patient had short-term success with bupropion in a previous quit attempt, if cost is an issue, if the patient has depression that would also benefit from treatment, or if the patient wishes to temporarily avoid post-cessation weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, bupropion is contraindicated in patients who have a seizure disorder or a predisposition to seizures. (See <a href=\"#H1543938359\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> below.)</p><p>We recommend providing follow-up in person or by phone one to two weeks after initiation of any pharmacotherapy to monitor for adverse effects, reinforce adherence to medication, and provide support for smoking cessation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults#H84078559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;, section on 'Arrange follow-up'</a> and <a href=\"#H3925282195\" class=\"local\">'Neuropsychiatric effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1970547743\" class=\"local\">'Follow up'</a> below.)</p><p>The efficacy of each first-line therapy for smoking cessation has been proven, though studies show differences in their relative efficacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97255\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97255 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>]. Strong evidence was provided by the Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study (EAGLES) trial, a double-blind randomized controlled trial that directly compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, nicotine patch, and placebo in over 8000 smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Each medication was more effective than placebo at six-month follow-up, but varenicline produced higher quit rates than bupropion or the nicotine patch, which were comparable in efficacy.</p><p>There is less evidence regarding the relative efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> compared with combination NRT, which was not tested in the EAGLES trial. Another randomized trial of 1086 smokers found no difference in biochemically confirmed abstinence rates among users of varenicline, single NRT (nicotine patch), or combination NRT (nicotine patch plus nicotine lozenge therapy) over a shorter period of 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Several other medications evaluated for smoking cessation have less evidence of efficacy than first-line agents. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nortriptyline</a> is a tricyclic antidepressant that is considered a second-line agent for smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-23</a>].

However, there is no evidence demonstrating the superiority of bupropion for smoking cessation over other agents in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Varenicline resulted in higher smoking cessation rates than placebo among patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (RR 4.74, 95% CI 1.34-16.71 in two trials); however, suicidal ideation and behavior were reported in two patients taking varenicline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. By contrast, no exacerbation of schizophrenia was seen in two other randomized trials that included patients with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2932544564\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular disease </strong>&ndash; In patients with stable cardiovascular disease (CVD), we use the same treatments as those for the general population. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Varenicline</a>, NRT and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> are effective in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/28-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-36</a>]. Concern was raised about varenicline&rsquo;s safety for patients with CVD, but the results of that meta-analysis are controversial and there appears to be little or no excess risk. A randomized trial in 714 smokers with stable CVD found that patients receiving 12 weeks of varenicline had a higher rate of continuous abstinence from weeks 9 to 52 compared with placebo (19.2 versus 7.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

There are fewer data regarding their efficacy and safety in smokers hospitalized with ACS, but observational studies suggest that they are probably safe to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because of its rapid onset, NRT is generally used to manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms in hospitalized patients. The general consensus is that the benefits of reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms and promoting smoking cessation outweigh any potential risks of NRT in most smokers with ACS. It is often continued after discharge to promote smoking cessation, although no randomized controlled trials have been done to demonstrate its efficacy in this specific situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, because of the lack of clear evidence, clinicians vary in their willingness to use NRT in the setting of ACS. There is a theoretical concern with the use of NRT in ACS because of nicotine&rsquo;s adrenergic and vasoconstrictive properties, which could potentially increase cardiac demand. Nevertheless, because NRT does not produce the rapid rise in blood nicotine levels that is produced by inhaling cigarette smoke, the rise in blood pressure and heart rate produced by NRT is more gradual than occurs after smoking a cigarette. Furthermore, NRT does not promote thrombogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], a critical trigger of ACS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Varenicline</a> has demonstrated efficacy in ACS. In a placebo-controlled randomized trial of 302 smokers with ACS, users who started low-intensity counseling and varenicline in-hospital and continued for 12 weeks had higher rates of both point abstinence (47.3 versus 32.5 percent with placebo) and continuous abstinence (35.8 versus 25.8 percent) at 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Adverse events within 30 days of study drug discontinuation were similar between the groups.

A possible explanation is that bupropion requires five to seven days to reach steady state. Thus hospitalized patients with ACS may return home before drug levels are adequate to counter smoking cues that the patient encounters at home.

NRT dose is then gradually tapered. In general, NRT use is recommended for two to three months after smoking cessation, though NRT use for as long as a smoker is at high risk for relapse is acceptable because NRT is much safer than continuing to smoke. Some smokers may need to use the products indefinitely.

Generally, NRT is used until a patient feels that he or she has stabilized as a nonsmoker. The patch may be continued longer, even indefinitely if needed, as NRT is safer than continued smoking. NRT is often used for a longer period in patients with comorbid psychiatric illness or other substance use disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For example, a randomized trial of 568 smokers found that compared with 8 weeks of nicotine patch therapy, extended therapy (24 weeks) was associated with higher rates of seven-day point-prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.23-2.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial in 525 smokers who received 12 sessions of smoking cessation behavioral counseling along with the nicotine patch for 8, 24 or 52 weeks found benefit at 24 weeks to using the nicotine patch for 24 or 52 weeks rather than for 8 weeks. However, there were no differences in abstinence rates at 52 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3735107539\"><span class=\"h4\">Short-acting nicotine replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A short-acting form of NRT (lozenge, gum, inhaler, or nasal spray) can be used as a single agent or can be added to daily nicotine patch therapy to help control cravings and withdrawal symptoms. However, short-acting forms require repeated use throughout the day, lead to more variable nicotine levels than the patch, and require more instructions for correct use. Smokers may be instructed to use the product when they have a craving, but this generally leads them to underuse the products. An alternative approach is to have the smoker use the short-acting NRT product at least once every hour while awake and more often as needed.</p><p>The choice of a short-acting agent depends on patient preference and comorbidities. The nicotine patch, lozenge, and gum are available in the United States without a prescription; nasal spray and oral inhaler require a prescription. A nicotine mouth spray and sublingual tablet are available in some countries, though not in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13311145\"><span class=\"h5\">Nicotine gum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine gum is a commonly used short-acting NRT. Chewing the gum releases nicotine to be absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in peak blood nicotine levels 20 minutes after starting to chew. Nicotine gum is available in several flavors that most users find preferable to the original flavor.</p><p>Dosing, duration and instructions for use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing is determined by the number of cigarettes smoked daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ge; 25 cigarettes per day &ndash; 4 mg dose of gum is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&lt; 25 cigarettes per day &ndash; 2 mg dose of gum is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chew at least one piece of gum every one to two hours while awake and also whenever there is an urge to smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use up to 24 pieces of gum per day for six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gradually reduce use over a second six weeks, for a total duration of three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper chewing of gum is important for optimal results. Gastric and esophageal irritation can occur if the gum is chewed too rapidly, because nicotine is released faster than it can be absorbed by the buccal mucosa and the nicotine is thus swallowed. Nicotine absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is largely metabolized by the liver and is therefore relatively ineffective for smoking cessation. &quot;Chew and park&quot; is recommended: chew the gum until the nicotine taste appears, then &quot;park&quot; the gum in the buccal mucosa until the taste disappears, then chew a few more times to release more nicotine. Repeat this for 30 minutes, then discard the gum (because all nicotine in the gum has been released).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acidic beverages (eg, coffee, carbonated drinks) should be avoided before and during gum use, as acidic beverages lower oral pH, which causes nicotine to ionize and reduces nicotine absorption.</p><p/><p>Side effects are mostly a consequence of excess nicotine release with overly vigorous chewing and consist of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, hiccups, headache, excess salivation, a sore jaw, and mouth irritation or ulcers.</p><p>Chewing gum may exacerbate temporomandibular joint disease and the gum can damage or adhere to dental appliances. Smokers with temporomandibular joint disease, with poor dentition, or who use dental appliances may do better with an alternative short-acting form of NRT such as the lozenge or inhaler.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13311152\"><span class=\"h5\">Nicotine lozenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine lozenges are a commonly used short-acting NRT product, with pharmacokinetics similar to nicotine gum. Lozenges are easier to use correctly than nicotine gum and are also available in different flavors. A smaller mini-lozenge that resembles a &quot;Tic Tac&quot; is also on the United States market. It dissolves more rapidly and delivers nicotine more rapidly than the original lozenge.</p><p>Dosing, duration and instructions for use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing is determined by how soon the first cigarette is typically smoked upon awakening:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Smokers who smoke within 30 minutes of awakening: 4 mg dose recommended</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Smokers who wait more than 30 minutes after awakening to smoke: 2 mg dose recommended</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use up to one lozenge every one to two hours for six weeks.

Based on its review of post-marketing case reports, the FDA in 2009 had required varenicline (and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>) to carry a boxed warning about possible serious neuropsychiatric side effects, including suicide and suicidal ideation, associated with these medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>The FDA also required the manufacturers of these drugs to conduct a large randomized controlled trial of the two drugs&rsquo; efficacy and safety in patients with and without psychiatric illness (largely depression and anxiety disorders). The resulting EAGLES double-blind trial enrolled approximately 8000 smokers motivated to quit, half of whom had stable psychiatric disorders (eg, major depressive, bipolar, or anxiety disorders). It found similar rates of neuropsychiatric adverse events with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, nicotine patch or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the trial, patients with psychiatric comorbidity had a higher rate of neuropsychiatric symptoms than patients without this comorbidity, but rates were low for both groups and there was no statistically significant difference in the rates of neuropsychiatric symptoms among smokers treated with NRT, bupropion, varenicline, or placebo. This lack of difference in neuropsychiatric symptoms among users of these agents was observed both for patients with and without underlying psychiatric illness. Based on these data, the FDA removed the boxed barning for varenicline (and bupropion) in December 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 randomized trials including over 10,000 participants with and without psychiatric illness also found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> did not increase the risk of suicide or suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, depression, aggression, or death compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3544467814\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiovascular effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although concern has been raised that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> might increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, the bulk of the evidence does not indicate an increased risk. Overall, for patients at low risk for an acute coronary event, it appears unlikely that varenicline is associated with a clinically meaningful increase in cardiovascular events. For high-risk patients, the effect of varenicline on cardiovascular event occurrence is less certain because trials have included relatively few such patients; however, no large increase in risk has been observed. Further, it is likely that any cardiovascular risk of taking varenicline, if it exists, is likely to be far smaller than the risk of continuing to smoke cigarettes. A 2011 FDA advisory suggested that the known benefits of varenicline for smoking cessation be weighed against potential harms in patients with CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>The precise risk of cardiovascular events with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> is difficult to define because of limitations in the available evidence. In one randomized double-blind controlled trial of varenicline in 714 smokers with stable CVD, cardiovascular mortality was lower with varenicline compared with placebo (0.6 versus 1.4 percent) but the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction was higher with varenicline compared with placebo (2 versus 0.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, these differences did not reach statistical significance, precluding a causal inference.</p><p>Two large meta-analyses of randomized trials found no differences in the rates of cardiovascular events in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. However, the overall rates of cardiovascular events in the trials were low, limiting the power of the analyses to detect a difference. An earlier meta-analysis excluded trials with no cardiovascular events and did find an association between varenicline and cardiovascular events (odds ratio [OR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.09-2.71) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

Cytisine appears to be a reasonable option for smoking cessation where available and may offer a low-cost pharmacologic alternative to therapies such as varenicline.

Although a meta-analysis suggested that clonidine was superior to placebo in facilitating smoking cessation, the majority of individual studies evaluating the drug have not demonstrated statistically significant efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Nicotine that reaches a smoker&rsquo;s bloodstream from inhaled cigarette smoke is bound by the antibody, producing a nicotine-antibody complex that is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, nicotine from tobacco smoke is unable to reach the central nervous system nicotinic receptors to produce the rewarding effects of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. Theoretically, a decrease in the rewarding effects of nicotine will lead to smoking cessation.

The combination of counseling and pharmacologic treatment can produce higher quit rates than either one alone. Referral of smokers to free telephone quitlines (eg, 800-QUIT-NOW in the United States) or to free web-based and text messaging cessation support (eg, at <a href=\"http://www.smokefree.gov/&amp;token=QKIBSNX8g6AhU0aUawfvSwz/fATci3Tb0gogNY35g6DdWFW7z/4PEn14RDdsVp+n&amp;TOPIC_ID=16635\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.smokefree.gov</a>) are good options for counseling, especially if office-based behavioral support is not available.

After consideration of specific safety concerns, contraindications (eg, bupropion is contraindicated in patients who have seizures), and comorbidities, the choice of agent is based largely on patient preference after discussion with a clinician. For most patients, we suggest either varenicline or a combination of two NRT products (a patch plus a short-acting form such as the gum or lozenge) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Bupropion or single NRT products are reasonable alternatives based on cost, patient preferences, comorbid diseases, and side effect profiles. (See <a href=\"#H2153241934\" class=\"local\">'First-line agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3433990068\" class=\"local\">'General population'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific considerations that further impact the choice of pharmacotherapy include psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease (CVD), seizure disorder, pregnancy, hospitalization, and level of commitment to smoking cessation.

In addition, the dose of the first-line medication should be increased if it is not yet maximized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients using first-line medications (including short-acting NRT) correctly and maximally without sufficient effect at four weeks, options include combining medications by adding another first- or second-line agent, switching to a different first-line therapy, or switching to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, a second-line therapy. Patients with no response to the initial agent are typically switched to a different medication. However, if the smoker had a partial response to the initial medication, adding an additional medication is a rational choice. Options for combination therapy include nicotine patch plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> plus varenicline, bupropion plus NRT, and nortriptyline plus NRT. Combinations of drugs appear to be more effective than monotherapy but can also produce more side effects. However, patients with no response to the initial agent are typically switched to a different medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who successfully quit and then relapse, we suggest that treatment with the pharmacologic agent that previously worked for them (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This strategy may be enhanced with more intensive behavioral support or by adding an additional first- or second-line smoking cessation medication.
