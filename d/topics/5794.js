During an echo, a doctor, nurse, or technician uses a thick wand, called a &quot;transducer&quot; or &quot;probe,&quot; to send sound waves into the heart. The sound waves create images that show the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart pumps, and how well the heart valves work (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56936\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56936 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>An echo can be done in 2 main ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doctor, nurse, or technician can put the transducer on the outside of your chest. This is called a &quot;transthoracic echo,&quot; or &quot;TTE.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doctor can put a tube with the transducer on the end down your throat and into your esophagus. This is called a &quot;transesophageal echo,&quot; or &quot;TEE.&quot;</p><p/><p>Sometimes, doctors do a test called a &quot;stress test&quot; along with a TTE. A stress test measures how well the heart works when it pumps very fast. When the heart pumps fast, it needs more blood. A stress test shows if the heart gets enough blood during these times. When a stress test is done with an echo, it's called a &quot;stress echo.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98935540\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order an echo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order an echo to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look for a problem in the heart or in the blood vessels around the heart</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow a known heart problem or condition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to find the cause of symptoms, such as shortness of breath, leg swelling, or an irregular heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your heart after a heart attack or heart surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well your heart medicines are working</p><p/><p>Your doctor might order a stress echo to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check for heart problems that get worse or are visible only when the heart pumps fast</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See if you can safely exercise after a heart attack</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98935547\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for an echo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on how the echo is done.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a TTE, you don't need to do anything special to prepare</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a TEE, your doctor will ask you not to eat or drink for 8 hours beforehand</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a stress echo, your doctor will probably ask you not to eat, drink, or smoke for 3 hours beforehand. He or she might also change or stop some of your heart medicines, if you take any.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98935554\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during an echo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the echo starts, the doctor, nurse, or technician will put some stickers on your chest to monitor your heartbeat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>For a TTE, you will lie on your back or left side. The doctor, nurse, or technician will put a small amount of gel on your chest. Then he or she will press the transducer against your chest and move it around. He or she might ask you to hold your breath or change positions during the test. Images of your heart will appear on a computer screen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>If you have a stress echo, the doctor, nurse, or technician will do an echo while you are resting. Then he or she will &quot;stress&quot; your heart and raise your heart rate with 1 of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you run or walk on a treadmill (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60855 \">figure 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you pedal a stationary bike (a bike that doesn't move, except for the pedals)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicine to make your heart pump faster &ndash; People who can't run or walk can get medicine instead of exercising.</p><p/><p>Immediately after these, while your heart is still pumping fast, he or she will do another echo.</p><p>For a TEE, you will have an IV (needle) put in your arm or hand. Your doctor will give you medicines through the IV to make you feel relaxed. He or she will give you a mouth spray or gargle to numb your throat. Then he or she will put a thin tube with a transducer on the end down your throat and into your esophagus. He or she will press the transducer against the esophagus wall to create images of the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98935561\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of an echo?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the type of echo.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A TTE does not have any downsides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A TEE can cause a sore throat or throat injury. The medicines used to help you relax can make you groggy. You will need someone to drive you home afterward.</p><p/><p>A stress echo can also have downsides. But they are caused by the stress test and not by the echo. When people exercise and their heart pumps very fast, they can have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or faint</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98935660\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-regurgitation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mitral regurgitation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-murmurs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart murmurs (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-valve-prolapse-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mitral valve prolapse (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-stenosis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mitral stenosis in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chest pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
