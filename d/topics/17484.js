Recognition is often delayed because nonspecific symptoms are attributed to the patient&rsquo;s underlying diagnosis. Unlike GVHD associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), ta-GVHD affects the transfusion recipient's bone marrow. Thus, unlike HCT-associated GVHD, ta-GVHD is almost always fatal.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis and management of ta-GVHD.</p><p>Other delayed complications of blood transfusion are presented in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p>GVHD associated with HCT is also discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GVHD results from an attack by viable immunocompetent donor lymphocytes on the recipient's antigen presenting tissues. This immunologic assault is manifested clinically by dysfunction of the skin, liver, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. The effect on the bone marrow distinguishes ta-GVHD from transplantation-associated GVHD. With HCT, the bone marrow cells in the recipient are of donor origin and are therefore exempted from attack. Thus, bone marrow aplasia, which is the primary cause of death in ta-GVHD, is an infrequent complication after HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Ta-GVHD does not occur after most transfusions because the donor lymphocytes are destroyed by the recipient's immune system before they can mount a response against the host. However, this protective response does not occur in two settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the recipient is immunodeficient (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Immunodeficient states'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is a specific type of partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between the donor and recipient (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Partial HLA matching'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunodeficient states</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion-associated GVHD was first described in 1965 in a cohort of immunodeficient children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Over the next 15 years, 38 cases were reported in a number of different immunodeficient states, including newborns with erythroblastosis fetalis, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute and chronic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other patients at risk include those with solid tumors who are immunosuppressed because of chemotherapy (eg, purine analog therapy) or radiation and severe congenital or acquired immune deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>By 1980, the incidence of ta-GVHD was estimated at 0.1 to 1.0 percent in patients with hematologic cancers or lymphoproliferative disorders. With the increased use of irradiation and leukoreduction of blood products in the 1990s, as well as a decreased use of fresh blood and directed donations, the incidence of ta-GVHD has fallen considerably. As an example, the incidence of ta-GVHD was approximately 0.15 percent in Japan between 1981 and 1986, whereas there were no cases reported in Japan during 2000 or 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>One interesting observation for which there is as yet no explanation is that ta-GVHD has not been described in a patient with AIDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial HLA matching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1986, ta-GVHD was first described in a patient without obvious immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This and subsequent reports established a second group of patients at risk for ta-GVHD: recipients of blood who are <strong>heterozygous</strong> for an HLA haplotype for which the donor is <strong>homozygous</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this setting, the recipient does not recognize the donor lymphocytes as being foreign, since the only HLA antigens seen by the host lymphocytes are shared by the recipient. However, the reverse is not true, since the donor lymphocytes view the host's tissues as foreign, leading to immunologic activation and ta-GVHD.</p><p>A 2015 systematic review that included 348 cases of ta-GVHD between 1966 and 2013 found that partial HLA matching was present in 60 of 84 individuals (71 percent) for whom HLA data were available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In these individuals, the frequency of partial HLA matching was higher than expected in those with an immunocompromised state, and partial HLA matching was seen in virtually all of those who developed ta-GVHD and were immunocompetent. The authors concluded that partial HLA matching appears to play an important role in the development of ta-GVHD in recipients of all levels of immune function, though possibly to a greater degree in those without impaired immunity.</p><p>The incidence of ta-GVHD in immunocompetent recipients is not known, but may be related to genetic variability within a population, as well as the incidence of consanguineous marriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It has been estimated that the frequency with which blood from an individual homozygous for an HLA haplotype is transfused into a recipient heterozygous for that haplotype is approximately one in 659 in Japan and varies from 1 in 500 to 1 in 7174 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, any patient receiving either HLA-matched blood components or blood from a blood-related relative should be considered at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Implicated blood products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ta-GVHD has been reported after the administration of nonirradiated whole blood, packed red blood cells, platelets, granulocytes, and fresh, non-frozen plasma. In comparison, ta-GVHD does not appear to be induced by frozen, deglycerolized red cells, Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), or cryoprecipitate. in an analysis of the storage time in 158 cases of implicated components, the component was &le;10 days old in 148 cases (94 percent) and 11 to 14 days in the remaining 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. No cases implicated components stored for &gt;2 weeks.</p><p>Studies in animals suggest that approximately 10<sup>7</sup> lymphocytes per kg of recipient weight are required to produce disease in a susceptible host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The per unit lymphocyte content of the blood components that can induce ta-GVHD is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole blood and red cells &ndash; 1-2 x 10<sup>9</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet concentrates &ndash; 4 x 10<sup>7</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apheresis platelets &ndash; 3 x 10<sup>8</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washed or microaggregate-filtered red cells &ndash; 2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulocytes by apheresis &ndash; 5-10 x 10<sup>9</sup></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frozen, deglycerolized red cells &ndash; 5 x 10<sup>7</sup>, which is generally below the amount required to produce ta-GVHD in adults</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ta-GVHD develops 4 to 30 days after blood transfusion. Patients typically present with fever and an erythematous, maculopapular rash which often progresses to generalized erythroderma and, in extreme cases, to toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other symptoms include anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain (most often in the right upper quadrant), profuse diarrhea (up to 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day),</span> and cough.</p><p>The main laboratory findings are pancytopenia (which reflects a strikingly hypocellular marrow), abnormal liver function tests, and electrolyte abnormalities induced by diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ta-GVHD is frequently delayed because the symptoms are relatively mild or are attributed to the underlying illness. The diagnosis is suggested from biopsy of affected skin, which classically reveals vacuolization of the basal layer and a histiocytic infiltrate, which is also seen in the aplastic bone marrow. Skin biopsy occasionally shows an almost pathognomonic finding &mdash; satellite dyskeratosis, which is characterized by single, dyskeratotic cells accompanied by lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The definitive diagnosis can be established only if the circulating lymphocytes are shown to have a different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) phenotype from host tissue cells, thereby proving that they came from the donor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13923907\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of ta-GVHD includes a variety of serious systemic illnesses.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), can be acquired from blood transfusion or from exposure to blood or body fluids from an infective individual. Dengue virus is mosquito-borne in endemic areas (eg, Puerto Rico, Latin America, Southeast Asia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Like ta-GVHD, these viral infections may cause fever, rash, hepatic dysfunction, and bone marrow failure. Unlike, ta-GVHD, serologic testing or nucleic acid testing for the virus will be positive, and skin biopsy will not show typical ta-GVHD findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection acquired from environmental exposure to contaminated water or soil, especially in tropical climates. Like ta-GVHD, patients may have fever, rash, pancytopenia and abnormal liver function tests. Unlike ta-GVHD, serologic or microbiologic testing will reveal leptospirosis, and skin biopsy will not show the typical findings of ta-GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leptospirosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leptospirosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug reaction</strong> &ndash; Patients with underlying hematologic conditions who require transfusion are also often receiving a variety of medications that may cause systemic reactions. These may cause allergic reactions, non-allergic skin eruptions, or a severe syndrome of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Like ta-GVHD, drug reactions can cause fever, rash, pancytopenia and abnormal liver function tests that are temporally separated from the transfusion. Unlike ta-GVHD, these drug reactions often have a temporal relationship to drug administration, and skin biopsy will show typical findings of the drug reaction rather than ta-GVHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liver failure</strong> &ndash; Liver failure can be caused by certain medications, either by dose-dependent hepatotoxicity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) or an idiosyncratic reaction (eg, antibiotics, anticonvulsants). Other non-infectious causes of liver failure include autoimmune and metabolic conditions. Like ta-GVHD, liver function may be severely impaired. Unlike ta-GVHD, patients with liver failure often do not have rash or pancytopenia; skin biopsy or liver biopsy will show typical findings of the specific disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-children-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">illness/malignancy</strong></span> &ndash; The illness leading to the original indication for transfusion may include a hematologic malignancy or immunodeficiency syndrome; some patients may also receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Like ta-GVHD, these conditions may be associated with fever, rash, pancytopenia, and systemic illness. GVHD associated with allogeneic HCT may also cause fever, rash, diarrhea, and liver failure. Unlike, ta-GVHD, the underlying illness or malignancy will not cause typical findings of ta-GVHD on skin biopsy. Unlike ta-GVHD, GVHD from allogeneic HCT does not cause bone marrow failure because the patient's bone marrow has been ablated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</strong> &ndash; Hemophagocytic syndromes including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) are characterized by profound immune dysregulation leading to uncontrolled macrophage activation; there are a variety of hereditary predisposing factors and environmental triggers. Like ta-GVHD, patients with HLH or MAS can be acutely ill with fever, rash, liver failure, and pancytopenia. Unlike ta-GVHD, <span class=\"nowrap\">HLH/MAS</span> often are associated with other laboratory findings (eg, very high ferritin, coagulation abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia), neurologic findings, and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AND PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ta-GVHD is poorly responsive to any available form of therapy and is almost always a fatal complication. Agents that have been tried without substantial success include corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, antithymocyte globulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. A number of experimental approaches have been reported, including ultraviolet irradiation, succinylacetone, inhibitors of the production of tumor necrosis factor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, interleukin-1 receptor antagonists, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-18</a>]. Two agents shown to have some success treating alloimmune (eg, hematopoietic cell transplant [HCT]-associated) GVHD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>, have yet to be evaluated in ta-GVHD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A unique patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been reported who had sufficient numbers of cryopreserved autologous peripheral blood stem cells available from a prior autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. She developed ta-GVHD 10 days following transfusion of nonirradiated blood components and was treated with Solu-Medrol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, antithymocyte globulin, and autologous HCT, with complete recovery from both the ta-GVHD and the CLL. In a systematic review that included 348 cases of ta-GVHD, 29 (8 percent) survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of these, three underwent HCT and more than half received some form of immunosuppression. Among the 312 who died, only five (2 percent) underwent HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A non-lethal, attenuated case of ta-GVHD was seen in a seven-month-old boy with combined immunodeficiency who happened to be under high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) at the time of the engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the absence of effective therapy, prevention is of primary importance. This can be best achieved by inactivating transfused lymphocytes by exposing all lymphocyte-containing components to gamma irradiation. This procedure should be followed for patients who are immunosuppressed, who have received a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), who are getting blood components from a family donor, or who are given human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched platelets.

The latter is usually present in radiation therapy departments and is less suited for irradiation of blood components. Thus, cesium-137 is the preferred source and is most often found in specifically designed, self-contained blood product irradiators. Some institutions have switched to using a dedicated X-ray source to deliver the required irradiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>According to a memorandum from the Food and Drug Administration (dated July 22, 1993) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the dose of delivered irradiation should be 25 Gy, targeted to the central portion of the container and a minimum of 15 Gy to any other point. This dose should result in more than a 90 percent reduction in mitogen response, a five to six log reduction in T cell response to mitogen, and complete inhibition of the mixed lymphocyte culture response.</p><p>Irradiation affects the allowable storage time for red cell-containing components, decreasing it to 28 days post-irradiation, due to changes in the red cell membrane that result in potassium leak. In addition, patients who may be unable to handle a potassium load (such as neonates) should have the plasma removed from irradiated red cell components that have been stored for more than two to three weeks after irradiation. Irradiation has no impact on the dating period for other cellular components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Leukodepletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third and fourth generation leukodepletion filters, which can produce a three to five log reduction in white cell number, can theoretically reduce the incidence of ta-GVHD. Although a United Kingdom surveillance study has indicated a reduction of this incidence after the institution of universal leukodepletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], employment of this procedure alone for the prevention of ta-GVHD is not fully protective, and leukodepletion should <strong>not</strong> be used as an alternative to gamma irradiation for those patients at increased risk of ta-GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/4,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26,27</a>].

This can be accomplished by the use of systems that are nucleic acid-targeted pathogen inactivation technologies (also called pathogen reduction technologies [PRT]; eg, Intercept Blood System, Mirasol PRT system). Each system uses a chemical agent (amotosalen and riboflavin, respectively) and ultraviolet light. These techniques are capable of reducing the active pathogen load as well as abrogating selected WBC immune functions and preventing T cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. These systems have been employed as part of the routine practice for platelet transfusions in some countries, and many institutions using these systems are not using gamma irradiation of platelet products that otherwise would have undergone irradiation. No ta-GVHD has been reported with this practice to date.</p><p>Pathogen inactivation technologies are discussed in detail separately.

However, this protective response does not occur in two settings: when the recipient is immunodeficient, and when there is a specific type of partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between the donor and recipient. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17697388\"><span class=\"h2\">Implicated products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ta-GVHD has been reported after the administration of nonirradiated whole blood, packed red cells, platelets, granulocytes, and fresh, non-frozen plasma. In comparison, ta-GVHD does not appear to be induced by frozen, deglycerolized red cells, Fresh Frozen Plasma, or cryoprecipitate. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Implicated blood products'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17697427\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ta-GVHD develops 4 to 30 days after blood transfusion. Patients typically present with fever and rash. Other symptoms include anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, profuse diarrhea, and cough.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main laboratory findings are pancytopenia due to a strikingly hypocellular marrow, abnormal liver function tests, and electrolyte abnormalities induced by diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is suggested from biopsy of affected skin, which classically reveals vacuolization of the basal layer and a histiocytic infiltrate, which is also seen in the aplastic bone marrow. The definitive diagnosis is established if the circulating lymphocytes are shown to have a different HLA phenotype from host tissue cells (ie, from the donor).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ta-GVHD includes certain infections, drug reactions, other causes of liver failure, the patient's underlying illness, and hemophagocytic syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H13923907\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17697475\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and prevention'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ta-GVHD is almost universally fatal; there is no effective treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention can be best achieved by inactivating transfused lymphocytes by exposing all lymphocyte-containing components to gamma irradiation. This procedure should be followed for patients who are immunosuppressed, who have received a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), who are getting blood components from a family donor, or who are given HLA-matched platelets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Certain pathogen inactivation technologies, capable of reducing the active pathogen load as well as abrogating selected white blood cell immune functions and preventing T cell proliferation, are in use in some countries, and serve as alternatives to gamma irradiation. (See <a href=\"#H5549862\" class=\"local\">'Other methods for WBC inactivation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukodepletion should <strong>not</strong> be used as an alternative to gamma irradiation for those patients at increased risk of ta-GVHD.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ferrara JL, Deeg HJ.
