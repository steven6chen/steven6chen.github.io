Shingles can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in those older than 50. Another name for shingles is &quot;herpes zoster.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14657313\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes shingles?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After someone has chickenpox, the virus sometimes hides out, &quot;asleep&quot; in the body. Years later, it can &quot;wake up&quot; and cause shingles. The first time a person is infected with that virus, he or she gets chickenpox, not shingles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030651\"><span class=\"h1\">Is shingles contagious?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes and no. It is <strong>not</strong> possible to &quot;catch&quot; shingles from someone who has the rash. But if you have never had chickenpox or gotten the chickenpox vaccine, it is possible to &quot;catch&quot; the virus and then get sick with chickenpox. Shingles and chickenpox are caused by the same virus.</p><p>You probably will <strong>not</strong> catch the virus (or get chickenpox) if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had chickenpox or shingles in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had the chickenpox vaccine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were born in the United States before 1980 (most people born before 1980 have had chickenpox even if they don't remember it)</p><p/><p>If you have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, be careful around anyone with shingles. Do not touch their rash. If you do, you could get sick with chickenpox. In rare cases, people can even get chickenpox from just being near someone with shingles. This is most likely if the person with shingles cannot fight infections well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030658\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of shingles?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, shingles causes weird sensations on your skin. You might feel itching, burning, pain, or tingling. Some people get a fever, feel sick, or get a headache. Within 1 to 2 days, a rash with blisters appears. Blisters most often appear in a band across the chest and back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50627 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66249\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66249 \">picture 2</a>). They can show up on other parts of the body, too. The blisters cause pain that can be mild or severe.</p><p>Within 3 to 4 days, shingles blisters can become open sores or &quot;ulcers.&quot; These ulcers can get infected. Within 7 to 10 days, the rash should scab over. By then, most people are no longer contagious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030665\"><span class=\"h1\">Can shingles be serious?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Shingles can be serious, but that is rare. About 1 out of 10 people with shingles will get something called &quot;postherpetic neuralgia,&quot; or &quot;PHN.&quot; People with PHN keep feeling pain or discomfort even after their rash goes away. This pain can last for months or even years. It can be so bad that it makes it hard to sleep, causes weight loss, and leads to depression.</p><p>Shingles can also cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems (if the rash is near the eye)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear problems (if the rash is near the ear)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dangerous infections in people who have other health problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030672\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you see your doctor or nurse within 3 days of when your symptoms start, yes. He or she should give you medicines to help you get rid of the virus. These medicines are called antivirals. They can speed your recovery and reduce the chances that you will have shingles-related problems such as PHN.</p><p>If you have had symptoms for more than 3 days, you should still call your doctor or nurse, especially if your rash is very red or painful. You should also call if your immune system (the body's infection-fighting system) is weaker than normal, for example because of certain illnesses or medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030679\"><span class=\"h1\">Can the pain be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people can deal with their pain with non-prescription pain medicines, but many people need prescription medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030686\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I take care of the rash?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keep the parts of your skin that have a rash clean and dry. Do not use creams or gels unless your doctor or nurse says you should.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030693\"><span class=\"h1\">Can shingles be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can reduce their chances of getting shingles by getting the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can also make the symptoms of shingles milder if they do occur. There are 2 vaccines that are available for adults over 50 years. Your doctor can tell you if you should get a shingles vaccine, and which one is best for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H396030700\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chickenpox (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shingles-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shingles (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
