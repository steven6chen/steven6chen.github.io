Symptoms associated with anemia, infection, and bleeding occur almost universally as a consequence of the treatment and the disease itself. Other complications, such as leukostasis, metabolic abnormalities, and involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) may also be life-threatening, and must be rapidly diagnosed and treated, lest they interfere with appropriate treatment of the leukemia, either before chemotherapy can be given, or during the recovery period.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the complications of AML. The clinical features, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and overall prognosis of AML are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myeloid-leukemia-treatment-and-outcomes-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myeloid leukemia: Treatment and outcomes in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AML typically present with a normocytic, normochromic anemia that can vary in severity. This anemia worsens with induction chemotherapy and is managed primarily with blood transfusions. There is no role for the use of erythropoietic stimulating agents during induction therapy of AML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-complications-of-malignancy-anemia-and-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic complications of malignancy: Anemia and bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The threshold for transfusion of packed red blood cells varies with patient age, symptoms, and the presence of medical comorbidities. In general, most centers recommend transfusion to asymptomatic patients with a hemoglobin &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/liter)</span>. Blood products should be leukocyte depleted to reduce the risk of alloimmunization and transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although graft versus host disease is very unusual in patients with leukemia receiving conventional chemotherapy, many centers routinely irradiate blood products for such patients.

As such, red blood cell transfusions should be administered very slowly, or, if possible, withheld until the blast count is reduced in such patients.

Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities may be seen. Based on the results of a number of randomized trials, platelets are usually transfused prophylactically to prevent hemorrhage at counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> and at higher counts in patients with active bleeding or with clinical problems such as hyperleukostasis, fever, severe infection, pulmonary compromise, or coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

DIC is often present in association with hyperleukocytosis in patients with acute myelomonocytic or acute monocytic leukemia. Coagulation profiles, including fibrinogen and measurements of fibrin degradation products should be obtained at the time of leukemia diagnosis. </p><p>Treatment with platelet transfusions and appropriate coagulation factors (eg, cryoprecipitate for severe hypofibrinogenemia) can be considered in select situations. It should be noted that the plasma in which platelets are suspended contains coagulation factors that can be of sufficient concentration for patients with milder DIC. This is discussed in more detail separately.

It is present in 10 to 20 percent of patients with newly diagnosed AML. Symptomatic hyperleukocytosis (ie, leukostasis), typically presenting with respiratory or neurological distress, constitutes a <strong>medical emergency</strong>. An absolute myeloblast count approaching <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> is a medical emergency even in the asymptomatic patient.

The inciting cause seems to be release of large amounts of phosphate from lysed blasts, which coprecipitates with calcium in the kidneys, leading to hypocalcemia and sometimes to oliguric renal failure. Hyperuricemia further contributes to this problem.

Acute severe hyperphosphatemia with symptomatic hypocalcemia can be life-threatening. Treatment includes vigorous hydration, if possible, and the administration of a phosphate binder with or without dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70281 \">table 1</a>).

Patients with acute hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia due to tumor lysis syndrome should NOT be treated with calcium until the hyperphosphatemia is corrected. Hemodialysis is often indicated in such patients who have renal failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70281 \">table 1</a>).

In this setting, the plasma potassium is normal but the measured serum potassium may be elevated due to release of potassium from the increased number of white cells during clotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The mechanism appears to be renal potassium loss secondary to tubular damage induced by high levels of lysozyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Aggressive replacement with parenteral potassium is required; hypokalemia usually abates after cytoreduction by chemotherapy. Another mechanism of hypokalemia is a side effect of therapy with certain drugs, such as amphotericin B.

The majority of thromboses appear to occur within the first month of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most of the thromboses that have been described are related to the presence of indwelling central venous catheters.</p><p>No controlled studies or society guidelines are available to guide decisions regarding prophylaxis or treatment of VTE in patients with AML. Prophylaxis for VTE is not commonly given to patients with AML because of the prolonged thrombocytopenia and associated bleeding risk during induction treatment. However, severe thrombocytopenia does not completely eliminate the risk of VTE in this population. VTE may be related to prolonged immobility and venous stasis from bed rest during induction therapy. Therefore, it is reasonable to encourage patients to be out of bed as much as possible during the induction phase of therapy. In addition, increased early mobility may also help ameliorate leg edema that frequently complicates induction therapy.</p><p>The treatment of VTE in patients with malignancy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-patients-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE PULMONARY FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pulmonary failure (APF) during induction therapy for AML is an uncommon but serious complication. Potential causes include lung hemorrhage, capillary leak from tumor lysis or fluid overload, infections, sepsis, and the differentiation syndrome in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=all-trans-retinoic-acid-systemic-tretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiation-retinoic-acid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiation (retinoic acid) syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one series of 1541 patients referred for remission induction chemotherapy for AML or high-risk myelodysplasia, 120 (8 percent) developed APF and required ventilatory support within two weeks of the initiation of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The mortality rate during induction therapy for these patients was 73 percent.</p><p>Multivariable analysis indicated five prognostic features predicting for APF: male sex, APL, poor performance status, lung infiltrates at diagnosis, and increased serum creatinine. Patients with zero to 1, 2, 3, or 4 to 5 adverse factors had estimated incidences of APF of 3, 13, 23, and 34 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">PERICARDIAL EFFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data describing the incidence and complications of pericardial effusions in patients with AML. In a retrospective study of 2592 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, echocardiogram data was available for 1600 patients (62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A pericardial effusion was present in 21 percent of patients with AML, 70 percent of which were minimal or trace in size. Moderate or large effusions accounted for only 5 and 0.5 percent, respectively, and only 3 percent of effusions required pericardiocentesis due to tamponade at the time of detection. Patients with pericardial effusions had similar survival rates to those without effusions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial disease associated with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
