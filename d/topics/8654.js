It is often called just &quot;IgAV&quot; or &quot;HSP.&quot;</p><p>The rash looks like tiny raised bruises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83025 \">picture 1</a>). IgAV (HSP) tends to affect children between the ages of 3 and 15, but it can affect adults, too. The symptoms of IgAV (HSP) usually go away on their own in about a month.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6536910\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of IgAV (HSP)?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rash that looks like tiny raised bruises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83025 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling around the joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain and upset stomach</p><p/><p>The rash caused by IgAV (HSP) is usually the first symptom of the disorder, but not everyone gets a rash. Sometimes the first symptoms are joint pain and swelling around the joints.</p><p>Some children also have symptoms affecting the stomach or intestines. For example, some children have nausea or vomiting. Others can have more serious problems, including something called &quot;intussusception.&quot; Intussusception is when the intestine folds into itself like a telescope. This can cause a blockage in the intestine and severe belly pain.</p><p>IgAV (HSP) can also cause problems with the kidneys (especially in adults), scrotum (in boys), and other organs.</p><p>IgAV (HSP) usually causes symptoms only for a month or so. Then it goes away without causing any long-term problems. Some people, though, can have longer lasting kidney problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6536925\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for IgAV (HSP)?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are tests that can help diagnose IgAV (HSP), but they are not always necessary. When IgAV (HSP) causes a rash, doctors and nurses can usually tell what it is just by looking at the rash and doing a routine exam.</p><p>If a doctor or nurse is unsure about whether IgAV (HSP) is the problem, he or she can order a &quot;biopsy.&quot; For a biopsy, a doctor or nurse takes a small sample of tissue to look at under the microscope. The sample can come from a part of the skin that has the rash or, less often, from the kidneys.</p><p>If you or your child has IgAV (HSP), the doctor or nurse will also want to do urine tests and blood pressure checks about once a week for a month or two. This is to check for signs of kidney problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6536940\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you or your child develops symptoms of IgAV (HSP), see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6536955\"><span class=\"h1\">How is IgAV (HSP) treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment mostly involves getting plenty of fluids, resting, and taking medicines to control pain, if they are needed. Most people can stay at home until they get better. People who have severe symptoms sometimes need to be treated at the hospital.</p><p>To manage joint or belly pain, doctors recommend medicines called NSAIDs. NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). People who do not get enough relief from these medicines sometimes get medicines called steroids, which help relieve inflammation. These steroids are not the same ones that athletes take to build up muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6536970\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
