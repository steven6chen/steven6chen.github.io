First-degree relatives of patients with IBD are approximately 3 to 20 times more likely to develop IBD as compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. In a large national, registry-based cohort study with a median follow up of 10 years, the risk of developing IBD was increased in offspring born to mothers with ulcerative colitis (HR 4.6, 95%CI 3.5-6.2) and mothers with Crohn disease (HR 7.7, 95% CI 5.7-10.5) compared with mothers without IBD; the impact of paternal IBD was not evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Clinical features of the disease also demonstrate a heritable pattern with concordance in disease location (eg, ileal versus colonic Crohn disease) and type (eg, fibrostenotic Crohn disease, fistulas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>].

Emerging data suggest that women with ulcerative colitis are more likely to have disease activity during pregnancy than women with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This may reflect the cytokine production of the placenta and its impact on ulcerative colitis.

The risk of disease activity in the untreated patient should be discussed alongside the potential risk of any medications used during pregnancy to maintain remission.

Patients with Crohn disease have a similar disease course during pregnancy and the postpartum as nonpregnant women with IBD. However, for patients with ulcerative colitis, there is greater disease activity during pregnancy and the postpartum than the nonpregnant patient. The reason for this is unclear and may be associated with smoking cessation, and cytokines secreted by the placenta or undertreatment of ulcerative colitis patients prior to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Approximately one-third of women with quiescent disease at conception relapse during the pregnancy, similar to the general IBD population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Relapses are more common during the first trimester. However, remission achieved during pregnancy is likely to be sustained throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.</p><p>In contrast, approximately 70 percent of patients with active disease at conception are likely to have continued or worsening symptoms during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

However, pregnancy may be protective in the long term, as suggested by lower relapse rates up to ten years following pregnancy as compared with rates prior to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. As parity increases, the risk for surgery to treat IBD also decreases, though this may simply be because healthier women are more likely to have multiple pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of IBD on pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with IBD may be at increased risk for antepartum hemorrhage, low birth weight infants, and premature delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/40,42,49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,49-52</a>].

The risk of poor pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD is greatest in those who have active disease at the time of conception, and in whom remission may be difficult to achieve during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,53,55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,53,55-59</a>]. As an example, in a Danish cohort study, the risk of preterm birth increased if the mother was hospitalized during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.4), and if the first hospitalization for ulcerative colitis occurred during pregnancy (OR 3.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Women with IBD should be followed as high-risk obstetric patients, particularly in the third trimester, and if the disease is active.

It is therefore important to discuss the benefits of breastfeeding as well as the compatibility of several antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications with breastfeeding as discussed below.

However, it is important to consider the risks, benefits, and optimal timing of such a diagnostic evaluation in pregnant or nursing women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H25426526\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H12689148\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H1133540027\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The safety and efficacy of endoscopic procedures during pregnancy have not been extensively studied. Endoscopy should be performed during pregnancy only if there is a strong indication (eg, significant bleeding) or if the information is critical for making treatment decisions (eg, establish the diagnosis of IBD in a pregnant patient with chronic diarrhea or stage disease if new therapies are needed). When possible, endoscopy should be postponed until the second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which can be performed without sedation or colonic preparation, are low risk in pregnancy in any trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. While there are several reports of colonoscopies being performed during pregnancy without complications, experience is relatively limited compared with sigmoidoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Obstetrical staff should be closely involved and the degree of maternal and fetal monitoring should be individualized. Recommendations for procedural sedation for endoscopy in pregnant and nursing women are discussed in detail separately.

These studies can be performed if they are necessary for maternal management and if there is no alternative imaging modality available. Several techniques can be used to minimize fetal radiation exposure. Magnetic resonance (MR) enterography is the preferred diagnostic modality in the absence of institutional expertise with ultrasound for IBD because it avoids the ionizing radiation of computed tomography. While MR enterography can be done in any trimester, intravenous gadolinium crosses the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-pregnancy-and-nursing-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

However, fertility in patients with IBD may be affected by active inflammation, medications, and prior surgery. (See <a href=\"#H692771488\" class=\"local\">'Fertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The course of IBD during pregnancy is determined in part by the activity of the disease at conception. Patients in remission at the time of conception are likely to remain in remission during pregnancy. In contrast, up to 70 percent of patients with active disease at conception are likely to have continued or worsening symptoms during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H521044030\" class=\"local\">'Disease control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with ulcerative colitis have more disease activity during pregnancy than women with Crohn disease. Women with IBD are at an increased risk for worse obstetric and pregnancy related outcomes as compared with the general population even with disease in remission. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy and lactation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy should be performed during pregnancy only if there is a strong indication or if the information is critical for making treatment decisions. An unsedated flexible sigmoidoscopy is considered low risk. Magnetic resonance enterography is the preferred diagnostic modality in pregnant patients with IBD in the absence of institutional expertise with ultrasound for IBD. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Safety of diagnostic evaluation during pregnancy and lactation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications during pregnancy and lactation should be based upon their relative safety and indications as well as the risk of relapse of IBD if the medications are discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H81259234\" class=\"local\">'Medications during pregnancy and lactation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with perineal disease or rectal involvement with Crohn disease should undergo a cesarean delivery.
