This effect is most prominent in the nephrotic syndrome, where marked elevations in the plasma levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) often occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1-5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,7,8</a>]. Total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are usually normal or reduced in the nephrotic syndrome and there is often a pronounced decline in the cardioprotective HDL2 fraction. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear, but elevations in the plasma concentration of cholesteryl ester transfer protein in nephrotic patients may contribute by shuttling cholesteryl esters from HDL2 to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The concentration of plasma apolipoproteins in the nephrotic syndrome generally reflects the alterations in lipoprotein metabolism. Thus, there are elevated levels of apo B, C-II, and E, which are associated with VLDL and LDL; on the other hand, the levels of the major apolipoproteins associated with HDL, apo A-I and A-II, are usually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Spontaneous or drug-induced resolution of the nephrotic syndrome reverses the hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>].</p><p>A low oncotic pressure directly stimulates hepatic apolipoprotein B gene transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, raising the plasma oncotic pressure with albumin or dextran reverses these changes in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and produces a rapid reduction in lipid levels in nephrotic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The reason why a low oncotic pressure stimulates lipoprotein production by the hepatocyte is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is not a simple compensatory response, since lipoproteins are too large to significantly raise the oncotic pressure toward normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercholesterolemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enhanced hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B and cholesterol has been thought to account for most of the rise in cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,15</a>].</p><p>However, diminished catabolism contributes to hypercholesterolemia in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. In one study, enhanced apolipoprotein B levels were principally due to impaired delipidation, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism, and a trend toward increased apolipoprotein B production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. No correlation was observed between the synthesis of apolipoprotein B and that of albumin.</p><p>Somewhat similar findings were found in a second report in which lipid kinetics were noted to be markedly different in patients with hypercholesterolemia alone as compared with those who had concurrent hypertriglyceridemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the former group, which had somewhat less severe nephrosis, the rise in cholesterol levels was largely due to diminished fractional catabolism. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia also had an increased rate of LDL production.</p><p>In a study of rats rendered nephrotic, there was a significant decrease in receptors for apolipoprotein in nearly all tissue compared with controls and analbuminemic rats, suggesting that this may be a mechanism leading to decreased clearance of lipoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In a series of patients with glomerular proteinuria, levels of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) correlated with a degree of proteinuria and levels of total, nonhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), and LDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Proteinuria reduction, however, did not appear to correlate with a reduction in PCSK9 levels in this study. By contrast, in another series of nephrotic patients who went into remission, a decrease in plasma cholesterol was accompanied by a reduction in plasma PCSK9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this same study, induction of nephrotic syndrome in mice using two different experimental models of podocyte damage produced a 7- to 24-fold increase in plasma PCSK9 levels, which appeared to be attributable to increased hepatocyte secretion and decreased clearance of PCSK9. Interestingly, mice lacking hepatic PCSK9 had lower lipid levels compared with wild-type mice in a nephrotoxic serum model of nephrosis. There are, as yet, no reports of nephrotic patients treated with PCKS9 inhibitors, but these drugs are of potential interest in treating statin-resistant or -intolerant hyperlipidemic patients with nephrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertriglyceridemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired metabolism, rather than enhanced synthesis, is also primarily responsible for nephrotic hypertriglyceridemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3,4,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,21,22</a>]. The delipidation cascade in which very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) are converted to IDL and then to LDL by lipoprotein lipases is slowed in the nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There is also a trend toward reduced LDL receptor-mediated clearance of LDL and IDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>].</p><p>How these changes occur is incompletely understood. The defect in triglyceride catabolism is most closely related to the renal albumin clearance, not the plasma oncotic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This finding suggests a major role for the urinary loss of a normally nonfiltered regulator of lipid metabolism. Observations in experimental animals have further enhanced our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms that may be involved. Plasma triglyceride levels are higher in nephrotic rats than in rats with analbuminemia despite similar rates of triglyceride production and a similar reduction in plasma oncotic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, decreased triglyceride catabolism must play an important role in nephrotic hypertriglyceridemia, an effect that cannot be explained by the low plasma oncotic pressure.</p><p>Angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) has been proposed to be the molecular link between proteinuria and hypertriglyceridemia. Circulating Angptl4 levels increase in response to an elevated ratio of free fatty acids to albumin as a consequence of proteinuria. Elevated Angptl4 levels then lead to inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a large body of literature implicating hypercholesterolemia as a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of coronary disease; furthermore, lowering high cholesterol levels can decrease the incidence of coronary events by inducing regression and more importantly preventing progression of atherosclerotic lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies to confirm these findings in patients with the nephrotic syndrome are unlikely to be performed. Nevertheless, it seems likely that patients with persistent nephrotic syndrome and hyperlipidemia are at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease, particularly if other cardiovascular risk factors are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3,5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,26</a>].</p><p>Experimental observations in animals with renal disease and some observations in humans, particularly post-hoc analyses, suggest that hyperlipidemia may also enhance the rate of progressive glomerular injury, perhaps by promoting an intraglomerular equivalent of atherosclerosis. This constitutes an additional rationale for reducing lipid levels in nephrotic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins and chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipoprotein glomerulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipoprotein glomerulopathy is a rare form of glomerular disease that is associated with dyslipidemia and lipoprotein deposits in the glomeruli. Patients with this disorder have elevated triglyceride levels and abnormally elevated apoE levels that are associated with mutations in the apoE gene.

The lipid abnormalities induced by the nephrotic syndrome reverse with resolution of the disease, as with glucocorticoid therapy in minimal change disease.</p><p>As previously noted, lowering lipid levels may both protect against systemic atherosclerosis and slow the rate of progression of the underlying kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23,24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statins and chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with coronary disease or a coronary equivalent, such as chronic kidney disease, is less than 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.

In a randomized trial of 20 patients with chronic nephrotic syndrome published in 1993, the use of a vegetable soy diet that is rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and low in protein produced a 25 to 30 percent reduction in lipid levels; addition of fish oil to this diet does not increase the hypolipidemic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, this observation has not been confirmed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potentially helpful adjunctive form of hypolipidemic therapy is the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Experimental and human studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are more likely to lower protein excretion (in part by reducing intraglomerular pressure) than other antihypertensive agents, an effect that has been associated with a slower rate of progressive kidney disease. As a result, angiotensin inhibition is a standard part of therapy for proteinuric chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The reduction in protein excretion with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be associated with a 10 to 20 percent decline in the plasma levels of total and LDL cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The magnitude of these changes appears to be related to the degree of fall in protein excretion, but they can occur with little or no elevation in the plasma albumin concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Statins are the treatment of choice for the hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome, if hyperlipidemia persists after treatment of the underlying kidney disorder with immunosuppressive therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an ACE inhibitor or ARB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29,30</a>]. Statins can lower the plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations by 20 to 45 percent, with a lesser reduction in triglyceride levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29-32</a>].

However, there are limited data examining statins and cardiovascular disease end points in nephrotic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One report has suggested that statins may be renoprotective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], an effect possibly mediated by improvements in endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], but this finding has not been replicated in other larger studies.
