Loiasis is transmitted by the bite of the <em>Chrysops</em> fly; west and central Africa are endemic regions. Manifestations of infection include transient localized subcutaneous swellings (known as Calabar swellings) and migration of the adult worm across the subconjunctiva of the eye.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>L. loa</em> will be reviewed here. Other filarial infections, including onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and <em>Mansonella </em>infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphatic filariasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphatic filariasis: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loiasis is transmitted by biting deerflies (<em>Chrysops</em>), which breed in the high-canopied rainforest of west and central Africa, including the coastal plains of northern Angola, southeastern Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda.</p><p>It is estimated that between 3 and 13 million people are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infection is occult in a large proportion of patients; therefore, in many areas, the epidemiology of loiasis has not been clearly defined. In endemic regions, the probability of infection increases with age; the proportion of infected individuals varies depending on vector abundance, which in turn is dependent on local ecology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Large-scale mapping of loiasis in 11 potentially endemic countries has been developed using a Rapid Assessment Procedure for Loiasis (RAPLOA), based on community questionnaires documenting the prevalence of a history of eye worm. RAPLOA surveys have helped identify specific regions in 10 African countries where loiasis is endemic, including regions where the prevalence of infection exceeds 40 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83532\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83532 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This is important given potential complications arising from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> treatment of onchocerciasis in those with concomitant loiasis.</p><p>Infection occurs most commonly in residents of endemic areas, but travelers to these regions can also be infected. Usually, months to years of exposure are required for infection. However, cases have been reported after as little as four days of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. It is unclear whether naturally acquired immunity develops after prolonged periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>L. loa</em> is spread via the bite of the female <em>Chrysops</em> fly, also known as the tabanid fly (horse fly or deer fly). This vector breeds in the canopy of rainforests and lays eggs in muddy swamps. The flies are attracted to movement and tend to bite humans during the daytime (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82917 \">figure 2</a>). During a blood meal, an infected fly introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound. These larvae mature into adult worms over a period of three months. The adult worms cause clinical disease; they live in the subcutaneous tissue and can migrate to any area of the body, including the subconjunctival tissue of the eye.</p><p>After a period of 6 to 12 months from the time of initial infection (the prepatent period), the adult worms begin to produce thousands of larval microfilariae that are released into the bloodstream. Microfilariae can be detected on blood smears or Nuclepore-filtered blood. Microfilariae do not cause pathology in untreated loiasis but can contribute to complications following treatment. Microfilariae are responsible for transmission of infection since they are taken up during the blood meal of female flies. <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae exhibit greater numbers in the blood by day (diurnal periodicity) in accord with the daytime biting habits of the <em>Chrysops</em> vectors. The life cycle is completed following maturation of microfilariae into infective third-stage larvae within the fly, which occurs over a period of 10 to 12 days.</p><p>Adult worms can live for more than 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] but do not replicate within the human host. Therefore, once an individual is no longer exposed to infective larvae (ie, after leaving an endemic region), the microfilarial burden can increase but the adult worm burden cannot increase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals with <em>L. loa</em> infection are asymptomatic. The two cardinal clinical manifestations of loiasis are transient localized subcutaneous swellings (known as Calabar swellings) and migration of the adult worm across the subconjunctiva of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82918 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Nonimmune individuals who travel to endemic regions and acquire <em>L. loa</em> infection are more prone to broader allergic-type symptoms than local residents; these include urticaria, pruritus, Calabar swellings, and occasionally asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Clinical manifestations can persist for prolonged periods even after the individual has left the endemic area because adult worms can live for more than 20 years. However, microfilariae are rarely detectable in blood smears of these individuals. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including a low burden of infection and a heightened immune response to the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Calabar swellings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient localized subcutaneous swellings (known as Calabar swellings) are a form of angioedema potentially due to hypersensitivity reactions to migrating adult parasite <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> released microfilariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The swellings can occur anywhere on the body but are most frequently observed on the face and extremities; they are generally preceded by local pain or itching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83533 \">picture 2</a>). Typical Calabar swellings are nonerythematous and measure 5 to 20 cm in diameter. Swelling can extend into nearby joints or compress peripheral nerves. Calabar swellings usually resolve spontaneously after two to four days, but they occasionally last for several weeks. Recurrent episodes can develop at the same site or elsewhere.</p><p>Calabar swellings are most frequently observed in nonimmune visitors to endemic regions with extended exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]. In one study, Calabar swellings were observed in 82 percent of those infected as visitors to endemic countries as compared with 50 percent of immigrants from endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5118751\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adult worm migrates to the eye and crawls beneath the conjunctiva, causing transient inflammation and edema. The adult worm usually measures 3 to 7 cm by 0.3 to 0.5 mm and typically migrates at the rate of 1 cm per minute. The worm may be visualized directly as it crosses the conjunctiva, which usually takes 10 to 20 minutes. Symptoms resolve spontaneously after the worm has left the eye, and usually there are no sequelae. Eye symptoms can occur in both endemic and nonimmune individuals. Rarely, adult worms invade the eye causing pain and intraocular inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Eye symptoms of loiasis should not be confused with intraocular microfilariae that characteristically develop with onchocerciasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional manifestations of loiasis in immune or nonimmune hosts include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalitis &ndash; Encephalitis can occur in patients with loiasis, generally, but not always in the setting of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylcarbamazine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylcarbamazine</a> (DEC) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a>. Symptoms can include headache, insomnia, or coma; death can result. Although most cases of encephalitis have been reported in patients with more than 30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> of blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], neurologic symptoms can occur in patients with lower microfilarial levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mechanism of posttreatment neurologic complications in <em>L. loa</em> infection is unknown; however, microfilariae have been described in the cerebrospinal fluid in a number of cases, suggesting that inflammation caused by dying microfilariae may play a role.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiomyopathy &ndash; Endomyocardial fibrosis leading to a secondary cardiomyopathy can develop in loiasis patients with a substantial eosinophilia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephropathy &ndash; Renal involvement leading to hematuria or proteinuria may occur in up to one-third of infected individuals and may be transiently exacerbated during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. The exact mechanism of renal involvement is unclear; immune complexes are believed to play a role in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Progression of nephropathy to renal failure is uncommon but has been reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; <em>L. loa</em> adult worms can migrate to any subcutaneous site, occasionally resulting in arthritis or lymphadenitis. Entrapment neuropathy related to inflammation and angioedema involving peripheral nerves may also be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5118872\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific but characteristic laboratory abnormalities include a high eosinophil count, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a high immunoglobulin (Ig)E level. These findings are more common in symptomatic nonimmune individuals than in residents of endemic areas. In a study of 186 patients with imported loiasis, eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;500/microL)</span> was observed in 84 percent of temporary residents of endemic areas (geometric mean absolute eosinophil count [AEC] <span class=\"nowrap\">1532/microL)</span> as compared with 64 percent of individuals native to endemic countries (geometric mean AEC <span class=\"nowrap\">670/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loiasis should be suspected in an individual with an appropriate epidemiologic exposure, consistent clinical findings, and supportive laboratory findings. The definitive diagnosis is established by identifying the adult worm in the eye or subcutaneous tissue or microfilariae in the blood. Serology may also be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Visualizing organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of loiasis can be definitively established by identifying a migrating adult worm in the subcutaneous tissue or conjunctiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82918 \">picture 1</a>) or by detecting microfilariae in a blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82919 \">picture 3</a>). Microscopy sensitivity is increased with a variety of concentration techniques, including Knott's concentration and Nuclepore filtration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Adult worms range in length from 2.0 to 3.5 cm for males and 5 to 7 cm for females. Both are no more than 0.5 mm wide. Microfilariae of <em>L. loa</em> are sheathed and measure 230 to 250 mcm long in stained blood smears. The tail is tapered and nuclei extend to the tip of the tail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82919 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p><em>L. loa</em> typically has diurnal periodicity, meaning that the microfilariae are more abundant in the bloodstream during the daytime (between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM) than at night. This coincides with the feeding pattern of the vector in most settings, thereby potentiating transmission of infection. It should be noted, however, that <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae have been demonstrated in blood smears collected at night in the Democratic Republic of Congo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Periodicity testing conducted in the context of this study revealed atypical patterns. Consequently, although diurnal periodicity differentiates microfilariae in loiasis from the nocturnally periodic, large, sheathed microfilariae of <em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em> in most epidemiologic settings in Africa, species confirmation by other morphologic characteristics or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be necessary in some cases. Microfilariae of <em>Mansonella perstans</em>, another human filarial parasite that overlaps in geographic distribution with <em>L. loa</em>, are not periodic but can be distinguished from <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae on the basis of their small size and the absence of a sheath.</p><p>Microfilaremia is observed more frequently among residents of endemic areas than in travelers and expatriates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/8,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-12</a>]. In one study, microfilaremia was observed in only 22 percent of those infected as visitors to endemic countries as compared with 74 percent of immigrants from endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests are most useful for diagnosis of loiasis among travelers and expatriates. In endemic populations, serology is generally not useful since antibodies remain positive for prolonged periods following infection and thus cannot distinguish between active or prior infections or quantitate microfilaremia. However, a negative result can exclude the possibility of <em>L. loa</em> infection.</p><p>Most antibody tests use crude antigen extracts from related animal filarial species. They have relatively good sensitivity but poor specificity, since they cross-react both with other filarial infections and with other nonfilarial helminthic parasites. Newer techniques, which measure specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 antibodies rather than total IgG, have been developed and are thought to be more specific for active infection with loiasis. However, these tests are not widely available.</p><p>One study evaluated an IgG4 antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a crude extract of <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae and found that, in patients with microfilaremia, this method had a sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 78 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among patients with no detectable microfilariae on blood smear, 55 percent had significant levels of specific IgG4 antibodies against <em>L. loa</em>, suggesting they carried occult loiasis. The authors concluded that, despite the limited sensitivity and specificity of the test, IgG4 ELISA could be useful for estimating the real prevalence of loiasis in epidemiologic surveys and could help to confirm the diagnosis of <em>L. loa</em> in amicrofilaremic subjects with suggestive clinical signs.</p><p>Another study examined IgG4 in three groups: amicrofilaremic individuals with verified ocular passage of adult worms of <em>L. loa</em>, microfilaremic patients, and unexposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The study showed that there was no significant difference in the level of parasite-specific IgG4 between amicrofilaremic individuals with occult infection and microfilaremic individuals. It also showed excellent specificity because there was no reactivity among unexposed individuals or among individuals exposed to filarial infections other than loiasis.</p><p>Serologic assays using recombinant <em>L. loa</em> antigens have been developed, including a sensitive and specific rapid assay that uses a luciferase immunoprecipitation system to detect antibodies to the recombinant <em>L. loa</em> antigen LLSXP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests that detect circulating <em>L. loa</em> antigens are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A real-time polymerase chain reaction assay has been developed at the Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institutes of Health that can detect and quantitate <em>L. loa</em> microfilaremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Subsequently, this assay has been adapted for loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a point-of-care molecular diagnostic tool that can be used in field settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Other novel point-of-care tools in development for identification and quantification of <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae include an adaptation of a handheld automated cell counter and a mobile phone&ndash;based video microscope (termed a LoaScope) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The LoaScope is designed to detect high levels of <em>L. loa</em> microfilaremia so that individuals at risk for adverse effects associated with mass administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> for treatment of onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis can be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The tool is not designed for diagnosis of <em>L. loa</em> in individuals, as it is insensitive for detection of low levels of microfilaremia.

In contrast with the macroscopic &quot;eyeworm&quot; of loiasis, onchocercal eye involvement is characterized by visual impairment related to the presence of ocular microfilariae. The areas of endemicity overlap with those of loiasis, and coinfection can occur, which is important for decisions regarding treatment. The diagnosis is established based on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and supportive laboratory evidence of infection.

The areas of <em>W. bancrofti</em> endemicity overlap with those of loiasis, and coinfection can occur. False-positive antigen tests for <em>W. bancrofti</em> in the setting of <em>L. loa</em> microfilaremia may complicate the diagnosis of occult <em>W. bancrofti</em> in coinfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/18,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28,29</a>].

Filarial serology based on crude antigen recognition may be cross-reactive in gnathostomiasis. The diagnosis is established based on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and supportive laboratory evidence of infection.

Intraocular involvement has also been reported with a number of species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Geography may be helpful in some cases. For example, the natural host for <em>B. procyonis</em> is the raccoon, a species that is not endemic in Africa.

Inflammation due to migration of adult <em>L. loa</em> worms under the skin is typically minimal and transient, especially following treatment, in contrast with the intense pruritus and persistence of an inflammatory track characteristic of cutaneous larva migrans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Larva currens, an evanescent serpiginous skin lesion due to larval migration, is sometimes seen but differs in clinical appearance from the migratory skin lesion of <em>L. loa</em>. Since strongyloidiasis overlaps considerably with loiasis in geography and available serologic testing is hampered by cross-reactivity between the two nematodes, empiric treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> (if no <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae are detected) may be appropriate in patients with loiasis and positive serologic testing for strongyloidiasis.

Since the incidence and severity of treatment side effects increase with increasing blood microfilarial counts, quantification of blood microfilariae is essential before initiating treatment. This can be done by counting microfilariae on blood smears made from defined volumes of blood (eg, 50 microL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or from larger volumes of blood (eg, 1 mL) concentrated through Nuclepore filters or using formalin (Knott's concentration) or saponin lysis. Quantification should be performed between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM to capture the peak number of microfilariae circulating in the blood. In patients within two weeks of travel from a different time zone, the time of the blood draw should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Serious side effects of treatment are uncommon in patients with low numbers of microfilariae in the blood (2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> has been suggested as a threshold, although supporting data are lacking). In general, patients with any detectable microfilariae should be monitored in a hospital setting during the first three days of treatment. Antihistamines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticosteroids have been used to limit posttreatment reactions, including Calabar swellings and urticaria, but do not prevent serious side effects, including encephalopathy. In patients with high levels of microfilariae, the risks and benefits of treatment need to be considered. In general, treatment should be reserved for symptomatic patients, patients with marked elevations in the peripheral eosinophil count, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients with concomitant onchocerciasis or lymphatic filariasis (who require therapy to prevent morbidity and mortality due to these infections).</p><p>An attempt should be made to lower blood microfilarial counts prior to DEC treatment. This can be accomplished using apheresis; however, this is not feasible in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a>, a benzimidazole with good oral bioavailability, has been shown to significantly decrease <em>Loa </em>microfilarial levels in a randomized trial (dosed 200 mg with fatty meal twice daily for three weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Adverse effects were not observed, even in individuals with &gt;50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> blood. Shorter higher dose regimens have not been effective. The gradual decrease in blood microfilarial levels over the course of several months suggests that albendazole may have preferential effects on adult parasites, explaining the lack of adverse effects associated with acute microfilarial clearance.</p><p>Pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> may provide an alternative to apheresis in patients with high level microfilaremia, although in many cases microfilarial levels remain above a safe threshold for DEC treatment and should be checked prior to initiation of DEC. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ivermectin</a> has <em>L. loa</em> microfilaricidal activity and, similar to DEC, can precipitate adverse events in patients with high levels of circulating microfilariae. Unlike DEC, however, ivermectin has no effect on adult worms and is not curative in <em>L. loa</em> infection. A study comparing post-treatment reactions in 12 patients with loiasis following single-dose ivermectin or DEC suggested that the underlying pathophysiology of post-treatment reactions following DEC and ivermectin share a common pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Endosymbiotic <em>Wolbachia</em> have not been identified in <em>L. loa</em> by light or electron microscopy or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] (in contrast with other filariae that infect humans such as <em>W. bancrofti</em>, <em>Brugia malayi</em>, and <em>Onchocerca volvulus</em>), precluding the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or other antibacterial agents for the treatment of loiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Diethylcarbamazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of choice for loiasis is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylcarbamazine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylcarbamazine</a>, a piperazine derivative. DEC has activity against both <em>L. loa</em> microfilariae and adult worms, so a sustained decrease in microfilarial intensity occurs following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. In one study, DEC (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for 21 days) lowered microfilaremia to 2 to 12 percent of the initial level for up to six months, killed 30 percent of adult worms, and eradicated infection in 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, a single course of treatment is curative in only 40 to 50 percent of patients. Relapsed infection can also occur.</p><p>Adverse events following treatment with DEC are due to rapid killing of the microfilariae and are most severe in patients with high levels of circulating microfilariae, although adverse effects can occur even in amicrofilaremic patients. Reactions are common, though serious reactions (encephalitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shock) are relatively uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Therefore, asymptomatic patients with high levels of circulating microfilariae should not receive treatment. Apheresis (if available) or pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> should be considered prior to DEC treatment of symptomatic patients with high levels of circulating microfilariae. (See <a href=\"#H15717704\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Treatment for patients without evidence of microfilaremia consists of DEC 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally in three divided doses for 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Albendazole has macrofilaricidal activity, causing sterilization or death of adult <em>L. loa </em>worms. Unlike DEC, albendazole does not have significant microfilaricidal activity. Consequently, fewer adverse effects are observed with albendazole compared with DEC, since there is no massive antigen release associated with dying microfilariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> against the adult worm leads to a gradual decline in microfilariae levels over several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/loiasis-loa-loa-infection/abstract/32,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,43,44</a>].

Loiasis is transmitted by the bite of <em>Chrysops</em> flies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82917 \">figure 2</a>); west and central Africa are endemic regions for infection. Infection is occult in a large proportion of patients; therefore, in many areas, the epidemiology of loiasis has not been clearly defined. Infection occurs most commonly in residents of endemic areas, but travelers to these regions can also be infected. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most individuals with <em>L. loa</em> infection are asymptomatic. The clinical manifestations include transient localized subcutaneous swellings (known as Calabar swellings) and migration of the adult worm across the subconjunctiva of the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82918 \">picture 1</a>). Nonimmune individuals who travel to endemic regions and acquire <em>L. loa</em> infection are generally more prone to hypersensitivity reactions to microfilariae <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> migrating adult worms than local residents. Eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;3000/microL)</span> is more common in nonimmune individuals. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of loiasis can be definitively established by identifying a migrating adult worm in the subcutaneous tissue or conjunctiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82918 \">picture 1</a>) or by detecting microfilariae in a blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82919 \">picture 3</a>). Serologic tests have been developed and are most useful for diagnosis of loiasis among travelers and expatriates. New polymerase chain reaction techniques are sensitive and quantitative assays of infection and levels of microfilaremia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylcarbamazine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylcarbamazine</a> (DEC) for treatment of patients with loiasis and &lt;2500 microfilariae per mL of blood (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Use of DEC can lead to adverse events (encephalitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shock) in patients with high levels of circulating microfilariae due to rapid microfilariae killing. Therefore, reduction of microfilariae with apheresis (if available) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> should be pursued prior to DEC treatment in the management of patients with symptomatic loiasis and &gt;2500 microfilariae per mL of blood. Patients with concomitant loiasis and onchocerciasis should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> treatment prior to definitive therapy with DEC or a regimen that does not contain DEC. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no vaccine against <em>L. loa</em> infection. Personal protection measures to avoid fly bites may have some utility in individual travelers, but large-scale vector control has not been shown to be feasible in endemic areas.
