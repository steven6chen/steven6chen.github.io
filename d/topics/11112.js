These methods are complimentary:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The automated instrument gives an extremely accurate measure of RBC size (mean cell volume [MCV]), averaged over millions of cells, along with the red cell distribution width, which if small indicates a uniform population of RBCs and if large indicates a variety of cell sizes. (See <a href=\"#H5826609\" class=\"local\">'MCV (cell volume)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5830437\" class=\"local\">'RDW (size variability)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peripheral blood smear reveals the sizes and shapes of individual RBCs, as well as RBC inclusions and abnormalities of other cell types, all of which may provide important clues to the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral blood smear review'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5826609\"><span class=\"h2\">MCV (cell volume)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Automated instruments routinely report the MCV (mean cell volume or mean corpuscular volume) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64238 \">table 1</a>); it is measured in femtoliters (fL; 10<sup>-15</sup> L). The MCV provides a measure of the RBC volume averaged over millions of cells. This typically is determined by passing cells one-by-one through a small aperture in an automated instrument that uses light scattering, refraction, or diffraction to estimate size in three dimensions. Additional details about these methodologies are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-hematology-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated hematology instrumentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, the MCV can be calculated using the measured RBC count (in standard units of million <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> equivalent to 10<sup>6</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/microL)</span> and the hematocrit (as a percent). </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MCV (fL) = (10 x hematocrit) &divide; RBC count</p></div></div><p>As an example, a hematocrit of 40 percent and a RBC count of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/microL</span> would give a calculated MCV of 80 fL ([10 x <span class=\"nowrap\">40]/5</span> = 80).</p><p>The normal range for the MCV is determined from the 95 percent confidence interval from a sampling of healthy individuals. Thus, 5 percent of healthy individuals may have a value outside the normal range (2.5 percent above, 2.5 percent below). Normal ranges also may vary slightly by age, sex, and race, especially in children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults &ndash; 80 to 96 fL (mean &plusmn; SD = 88 &plusmn; 4 fL) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children &ndash; varies by age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101544 \">table 2</a>); (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia#H366934738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;, section on 'Classification of anemia'</a>)</p><p/><p>Microcytosis refers to an MCV below the lower limit of normal.</p><p>Because MCV is an average, it does not describe the range of RBC sizes in the sample, and a sample with a normal MCV may have significant populations of abnormally small <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large cells. Variation in RBC size can have important implications for determining the cause of microcytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The range and variability of RBC size is determined using the red cell distribution width <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> observation of RBCs on the peripheral blood smear. (See <a href=\"#H5830437\" class=\"local\">'RDW (size variability)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral blood smear review'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5830437\"><span class=\"h2\">RDW (size variability)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RBC distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the variation in RBC sizes, based on the width of the MCV histogram (bell-shaped curve around the mean). If there is a single uniform population of cells, the RDW is small because all of the RBC volumes cluster tightly around the mean. If there is a large range of cell sizes, the histogram appears as a broad peak, and if there are two distinct populations, as two narrow peaks, the RDW for both of these non-uniform populations would be increased.</p><p>The normal range for the RDW is 11.5 to 14.5 percent. There is no condition that regularly yields a RDW less than normal. Thus, in practice, the RDW is either normal or elevated.</p><p>An RDW in the normal range indicates that the size distribution of RBCs has the normal degree of variation (ie, a relatively homogenous population of cells). However, a normal RDW is relatively insensitive for eliminating the possibility of RBC abnormalities because there may be a uniform population of abnormally small or abnormally large cells (ie, a normal RDW centered around an abnormal cell size).</p><p>An increased RDW suggests greater-than-normal variation in RBC size; however, it is not highly specific or sensitive for making or excluding any diagnoses. As an example, the RDW is frequently increased in anemias caused by vitamin or mineral deficiencies (eg, folate, vitamin B12, iron). Additionally, one study evaluated the RDW in 26 patients with untreated vitamin B12 deficiency from pernicious anemia and found that one-third of the individuals had a normal RDW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As noted above, an increased RDW may also be seen with two homogenous populations of cells (eg, a population of microcytic cells from hemolysis plus a population of reticulocytes, which are larger than normal RBCs) or following RBC transfusion, when patient RBCs and transfused RBCs are averaged together. We feel that the use of RDW to suggest a specific hematologic diagnosis may be misleading and cannot take the place of peripheral blood smear review by an experienced clinician, despite attempts to derive pattern analysis algorithms based on RDW and other RBC parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral blood smear review'</a> below.)</p><p>Numerous observational studies have correlated a high RDW with adverse outcomes, including mortality. However, the RDW may be merely a marker of other adverse prognostic factors such as age, comorbidities, or physiologic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>].

Iron deficiency may be seen in parts of the world where nutrition is inadequate, or in individuals with chronic blood loss, including menstruating women and individuals with gastrointestinal bleeding. Anemia of chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease) may be associated with microcytosis and anemia, although normal RBC size is more frequently seen; however, the overall high prevalence of this condition, especially in the developed world, makes it a common cause of microcytosis even though microcytosis is not the most common manifestation. Thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia are more common in certain parts of the world, but thalassemia trait may be identified as an incidental finding. Iron deficiency and thalassemia are both characterized by decreased hemoglobin production, due to insufficient availability of heme or globin, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Iron deficiency anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3162029348\" class=\"local\">'Anemia of chronic inflammation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Thalassemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Rare causes of microcytosis include lead poisoning, copper or zinc deficiency, some forms of drug-induced anemia, inherited syndromes of defective iron metabolism, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (See <a href=\"#H135457973\" class=\"local\">'Rare causes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron deficiency anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) may be seen in individuals of any age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, iron deficiency is more commonly due to reduced iron intake than to blood loss, especially in resource-poor settings. The exclusive use of cow's milk (without breastfeeding or iron-supplemented formula) may also cause iron deficiency in infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, iron deficiency is more frequently due to blood loss that exceeds iron intake. In some individuals such as women with heavy menstrual periods or pregnancy, the cause is obvious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In others, the source of blood loss may not be immediately apparent. A search for the source of blood loss is almost always indicated, especially in individuals over 50 years of age with new onset iron deficiency, for whom colorectal cancer is not an uncommon underlying cause of blood loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Individuals with suspected iron deficiency should have laboratory testing that is stratified for their age and possible related conditions. For infants without risk factors for (or evidence of) lead toxicity, a complete blood count may be sufficient. For children and young adults, it is appropriate to obtain a reticulocyte count, review the RBC indices <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the blood smear, and test the stool for occult blood. For individuals with other medical conditions, it is appropriate to measure iron studies (serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity [TIBC]), and serum iron.</p><p>Iron deficiency is associated with microcytosis, low serum ferritin, and increased TIBC; in early stages the hemoglobin level may be only mildly reduced or within the normal range. IDA is characterized by an inappropriately low reticulocyte count (unless a dose of iron was recently administered), low serum ferritin, increased TIBC, and low serum iron. Patients with IDA have parallel decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count. The degree of hypochromia and microcytosis can be quite variable from cell to cell, leading to the presence of an elevated RBC distribution width (RDW). The severity of iron deficiency correlates somewhat with the degree of deficiency (eg, individuals with severe iron deficiency may have dramatically reduced MCV), but the MCV is neither sensitive nor specific for making the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. It is also worth noting that a reduction in MCV due to iron deficiency may be blunted by concomitant conditions that lead to macrocytic anemia, such as liver disease or vitamin B12 deficiency. The gold standard for assessing iron deficiency is bone marrow evaluation and staining of RBC precursors for iron using Prussian blue staining. In practice this may be helpful if bone marrow evaluation is done for other reasons but is rarely required to diagnose iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with IDA without an obvious source of blood loss should have stool tested for blood. However, adults &gt;50 years of age with new onset IDA should have a gastrointestinal evaluation for a bleeding lesion regardless of the results of stool occult blood testing, because gastrointestinal lesions can bleed intermittently. Other causes of iron loss may include gastrointestinal telangiectasias, exercise-induced hemolysis and urinary blood loss, and surgical treatment for obesity, especially surgery involving the duodenum (site of iron absorption) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A response to iron administration may be sufficient in some infants with anemia and suspected iron deficiency; however, a trial of iron administration is not appropriate for individuals with complex medical illnesses, possible other causes for anemia, and adults, because this fails to identify and address other possible illnesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine. Iron deficiency anemia that is unresponsive to oral iron administration is often seen, especially in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

These individuals generally should not be treated with iron unless concomitant iron deficiency is identified; some of these individuals may actually have excess iron stores and be at risk for complications of iron.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3162029348\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia of chronic inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia of chronic inflammation (also called anemia of chronic disease) is a diagnosis made in individuals with a medical illness capable of causing chronic inflammation in whom other causes of anemia have been eliminated (ie, it is a diagnosis of exclusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Direct testing of cytokines or of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin are not available for routine clinical practice, although hepcidin testing is being developed and may turn out to be useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;, section on 'Hepcidin'</a>.)</p><p>The MCV is not especially helpful in making the diagnosis of anemia of chronic inflammation. However, an MCV below 70 fL is unlikely to be due to anemia of inflammation alone. The hallmarks of anemia of inflammation are low serum iron, low TIBC, and normal to increased serum ferritin. However, serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be normal or elevated due to chronic inflammation rather than adequate iron stores. Additionally, some individuals with anemia of chronic inflammation may also have (or develop) iron deficiency.</p><p>Inflammatory conditions responsible for anemia of chronic inflammation are diverse and numerous, and include chronic infections (eg, pulmonary tuberculosis), inflammation (eg, active rheumatoid arthritis), and malignancies.

Alpha thalassemia is due to reduced alpha globin and beta thalassemia is due to reduced beta globin. For each, the severity of the disease correlates with the severity of the reduction in globin levels. Thalassemias are most prevalent in Africa, the Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, heterozygosity for thalassemia mutations is seen worldwide, and heterozygous individuals (eg, thalassemia minor or thalassemia intermedia) may be diagnosed incidentally in childhood or adulthood. Physical examination may reveal mild splenomegaly.</p><p>Individuals with thalassemia minor or thalassemia trait may not be anemic (or have only mild anemia). A typical hemoglobin level is 10 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in beta thalassemia minor, with an MCV of approximately 65 to 75 fL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcytosis-microcytic-anemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Rarely, extremely large platelets or white blood cell fragments may be counted as RBCs. These artifactual effects and machine error can be addressed by repeating the sample <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reviewing the peripheral blood smear.

If the RBC count is low (suggestive of iron deficiency), we obtain iron studies. If the ethnicity or family history is suggestive of thalassemia, we may perform hemoglobin analysis, especially if the RBC count is normal or increased. If the patient has an acute illness such as an infection, it may be appropriate to repeat iron studies after the illness resolves.</p><p>Approaches to the evaluation for iron deficiency and thalassemia are presented separately.

For a patient with a chronic inflammatory state such as diabetes, it may be appropriate to focus on treating that condition without performing extensive additional evaluations. The typical clinical and laboratory features of the anemia of chronic disease are discussed in more detail separately.
