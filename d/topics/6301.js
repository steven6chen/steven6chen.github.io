However, while PAH causes pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (ie, pulmonary &quot;arteriolar&quot; hypertension, which overall includes those in groups 1, 3, 4, and some patients in group 5 PH), PVOD and PCH are forms of mixed pre-capillary, capillary, and post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (ie, pulmonary &quot;venous&quot; hypertension) similar in this manner to patients with group 2 PH(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 2</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is unknown, primarily because many cases are probably misclassified as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTEPH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

The age at which the disease presented in such families has ranged from eight weeks to age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Genetic mutations of the following have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase (EIF2AK4) gene &ndash; One study of 13 families with PVOD detected recessive and biallelic mutations in the EIF2AK4 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Biallelic mutations have also been described in 25 percent sporadic cases of PVOD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In a registry of patients with suspected PVOD, those with biallelic mutations of EIF2AK4 presented at a younger age but disease severity was similar to those without mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Two brothers with pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH; thought to be a variant of PVOD), were also identified to have biallelic mutations in EIF2AK4, as were 2 out of 10 patients with sporadic PCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This kinase, EIF2AK4 (also called <em>GCN2</em>), phosphorylates the protein, EIF2, to down regulate protein synthesis necessary for cell growth and replication. Thus, mutations potentially result in uncontrolled cell growth. Although not routine, many centers with expertise in pulmonary hypertension test patients with suspected PVOD for mutations in this gene. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and approach to clinical diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) &ndash; Mutations in several loci of the BMPR2 gene have been reported in patients with PVOD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>]. BMPR2 mutations are responsible for up to one-half of all cases of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and as many as 25 percent of cases of nonfamilial PAH. The true incidence in PVOD is unknown but mutations appear to be significantly less common than in those with PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The bone morphogenetic protein family of proteins is related to TGF-beta and consists of at least 10 peptides that are produced by many different cells and have multiple actions on growth and development. Centers with expertise in PH test patients with a family history for mutations in this gene, regardless of the suspicion for PVOD, the details of which are provided separately.

In the past, many patients required a surgical lung biopsy for definitive histopathologic diagnosis. However, most experts now believe that a clinical diagnosis of PVOD can be made in most patients following an integrated assessment for pulmonary hypertension using a constellation of clinical, computed tomographic (non contrast CT), physiologic, and hemodynamic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105806 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. We and other experts prefer this noninvasive approach to the diagnosis since the risk of biopsy in patients with pulmonary vasculopathy is considerably high (hemorrhage, hemodynamic collapse). </p><p>During the evaluation of patients for pulmonary hypertension (PH), PVOD should be suspected in those with manifestations of pulmonary arterial hypertension who have evidence of pulmonary venous congestion in the absence of left-sided heart disease.

When it occurs, hemoptysis is typically minimal and rarely massive or life threatening, although diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and sudden death are uncommonly described presentations of PVOD.</p><p>Exposure to toxins or the presence of conditions classically associated with PVOD (eg, mitomycin-C, trichloroethylene, systemic sclerosis, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) should raise the suspicion for PVOD. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Drugs and toxins'</a> above and <a href=\"#H74965762\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic stem cell transplant'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> above.)</p><p>The signs of PVOD are generally those of progressive PH, including cyanosis, a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a split second heart sound, right-sided cardiac murmurs (eg, tricuspid regurgitation), a third or fourth heart sound (ie, gallop), a left parasternal heave, a downward subxiphoid thrust, a pulmonary artery tap, elevated jugular venous pressure, an enlarged liver, and peripheral edema. Auscultatory crackles may occur in patients who have prominent chronic pulmonary infiltrates and decreased breath sounds with dullness to percussion may exist in patients with pleural effusions.</p><p>Since these symptoms are shared with PAH and sometimes mistaken for a respiratory infection, the initial suspicion for PVOD is frequently low, resulting in a delayed diagnosis.

These features are likely due to chronic pulmonary capillary hypertension, transudation of fluid into the interstitium, and enlargement of pulmonary lymphatic channels. However, in general, these features are not highly specific since they may be seen in many other pulmonary disorders including pulmonary hemorrhage, infarction, infection, and sarcoidosis; thus their presence or absence neither confirms nor precludes a diagnosis of PVOD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450641310\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to patients with PAH, chest radiographs may demonstrate enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries (ie, signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension).

Many patients are initially presumed to have heart failure (due to the abnormalities on chest radiographs and CT scans), CTEPH (due to abnormalities on <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scans), or parenchymal lung disease, such as sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, or pneumoconiosis (due to chronic interstitial changes on chest radiographs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Thus, the diagnosis can be missed and is sometimes only made retrospectively at autopsy or on explanted tissue.

While in the past, the diagnosis was typically made on surgical lung biopsy, the diagnosis is now frequently made on clinical grounds and histological confirmation is often obtained in explanted lung or at autopsy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and approach to clinical diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>PVOD is a fibroproliferative disease primarily affecting the small pulmonary veins with relative sparing of the larger veins. The pathologic hallmark of PVOD is extensive and diffuse occlusion of the pulmonary veins due to smooth muscle hypertrophy and collagen matrix deposition (ie, fibrous tissue). The fibrous tissue may be loose and edematous (perhaps reflecting an earlier stage of development), or dense and sclerotic (perhaps reflecting a later stage of development) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52802\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52802 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,118-121\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,118-121</a>]. While uncommon, luminal narrowing of the pulmonary veins from acute thrombus is also seen. </p><p>In addition, to these features, the media of the pulmonary veins may become &quot;arterialized&quot; with an increase in elastic fibers; when &quot;arterialization&quot; is extensive, these features may be mistaken for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Recanalization of completely occluded vessels occurs over time, and calcium may encrust the elastic fibers in the walls of the veins or alveoli. Intimal thickening tends to be eccentric and usually involves the venules and small veins in the interlobular septa which may help to distinguish PVOD from PAH. </p><p>Long-standing PVOD can result in the deposition of collagen fibers within lobular septae and, to a lesser degree, alveolar walls. These changes are similar to those noted in long-standing mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Fibrosis may be sufficiently extensive that the differential diagnosis includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66071\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66071 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary arterioles may also be involved, with moderate to severe medial hypertrophy in approximately one-half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. Arteritis and arterial plexiform lesions, classic features of PAH, are usually absent. Such cases may represent mixed pre-capillary and post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105764\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764 \">table 2</a>). &#160;</p><p>Alveolar capillaries may be engorged and tortuous, consistent with pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/91,124,125\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,124,125</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study, 73 percent of patients with PVOD had coexisting PCH, and venous changes were seen in most patients receiving histologic diagnosis of PCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. This observation has led to the hypothesis that, for most patients, PVOD and PCH represent the same diagnosis. PCH may be caused by PVOD; specifically, PCH may be a proliferative response to pulmonary venous hypertension. Supporting this hypothesis, PCH can complicate other diseases characterized by pulmonary venous hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/126-128\" class=\"abstract_t\">126-128</a>].</p><p>Additional findings include dilated pulmonary lymphatics, dilated pleural lymphatics, and interstitial edema that is most notable in lobular septa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72794 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/78,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,103</a>]. Concomitant type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and focal lymphocytic infiltrates occur in many patients and can be extensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-veno-occlusive-disease-in-adults/abstract/120,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,129</a>].</p><p>A slightly less common finding is hemosiderin in alveolar macrophages or the interstitium, thought to be due to passive congestion or occult hemorrhage. Hemorrhage may also be present, but it is difficult to distinguish blood due to disease from blood due to the biopsy procedure. Occasionally, hemosiderin or blood is sufficiently prominent that the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis or a healed vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener's granulomatosis) is entertained. While PVOD may be suggested if hemosiderosis and one or more sclerosed venules are identified in a biopsy specimen, this is not diagnostic because intimal sclerosis can be a normal consequence of aging. The presence of an occasional sclerosed pulmonary vein is not sufficient for diagnosis and must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and radiographic features.
