The ANC is equal to the product of the white blood cell count (WBC) and the fraction of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and band forms noted on the differential analysis:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;ANC &#160;= &#160;WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">(cells/microL)</span> &#160;x &#160;percent (PMNs &#160;+ &#160;bands) &#160;&divide; &#160;100</p></div></div><p>Neutrophilic metamyelocytes and younger forms are not included in this calculation.

Leukopenia refers to a low WBC that may be due to lymphopenia as well as neutropenia, while granulocytopenia refers to a reduced number of granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). </p><p>Agranulocytosis literally means the absence of granulocytes, but the term is often used to indicate severe neutropenia (ie, ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12000377\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of congenital neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;congenital neutropenia&quot; is somewhat confusing in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &quot;Congenital&quot; neutropenia technically means any neutropenia present at or near birth, and thus would include transient immune neutropenias as well as inherited causes. We use the term to indicate neutropenia starting at or around birth and due to a primary bone marrow failure syndrome primarily involving the myeloid series. The term &quot;congenital neutropenia&quot; primarily refers to severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), with the Kostmann Syndrome (HAX1 mutation) as one subtype. In a broader sense, cyclic neutropenia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) are also included, although these disorders are usually referred to directly by their specific names (cyclic neutropenia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Both cyclic neutropenia and SDS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic neutropenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shwachman-diamond-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shwachman-Diamond syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to these disorders, there are now many recognized primary genetic defects that can result in serious chronic neutropenia with or without other immune deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. Most are characterized by a decreased bone marrow myeloid cell production, and an increased propensity to infection because of the resulting neutropenia. However, the neutropenia may be secondary to some other immune dysregulation and not a primary defect in production of neutrophils. Similarly, the propensity to infection may be due to an associated immune defect rather than the neutropenia itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia#H1006826\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;, section on 'Causes of neutropenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1828169\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients present clinically with oropharyngeal problems, otitis media, respiratory infections, cellulitis, and skin infections, most often due to staphylococci and streptococci. Oral ulcerations and painful gingivitis are almost always present by two years of age in patients with severe neutropenia associated with decreased marrow reserve, although some children may also have stomatitis. Diffuse gastrointestinal lesions can give abdominal pain and diarrhea with a presentation mimicking Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In comparison, infections with yeast, fungi, and parasites are infrequent in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), SDS, and cyclic neutropenia since other immune functions are intact. While congenital neutropenia patients can become septic, the propensity to overwhelming infection is not as severe as is seen in post-chemotherapy neutropenia.</p><p>Some patients have dysmorphic features or other associated physical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are generally not part of congenital neutropenia syndromes except as noted below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In general, any dysmorphic features in association with hematological findings of cytopenia should raise the questions of inherent marrow failure syndromes. Other clinical features of neutropenia with decreased marrow reserve are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12000400\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neutropenia seen in the congenital neutropenias begins in infancy and is associated with decreased production of myelocytes and cells beyond myelocytes. Affected patients usually have isolated neutropenia with an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL</span>. There may also be a relative monocytosis with monocyte percentage in the 30 to 50 percent range in some cases. At the time of the nadir of the neutrophil count in cyclic neutropenia there is a reciprocal monocytosis.</p><p>The hematologic presentations of these conditions are quite diverse. As an example, although all patients with SDS demonstrate varying degrees of bone marrow failure generally at an early age, some do not present until later in childhood, and approximately 10 percent do not have neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shwachman-diamond-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shwachman-Diamond syndrome&quot;, section on 'Neutropenia/bone marrow failure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1828195\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow aspiration can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of congenital neutropenia. Bone marrow examination in SCN characteristically shows normal or somewhat decreased cellularity with an early myeloid &quot;arrest&quot; at the <span class=\"nowrap\">promyelocyte/myelocyte</span> stage, often with atypical nuclei and cytoplasmic vacuolization. This bone marrow morphology is seen most typically in SCN due to mutations in ELANE, HAX1, WASP, G6PC3, and G-CSF receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/1,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-9</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the marrow in SDS, glycogen storage disease 1b, WHIM, Cohen disease, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 is not characteristic, but usually is hypocellular with decreased myeloid precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some patients with SDS have involvement of other cell lines as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bone marrow aspiration is not at all helpful in CN as the findings depend on when in the cycle the bone marrow is sampled. If done at the onset of neutropenia, it is similar to SCN.</p><p>Some of the disorders noted below are T cell or B cell defects that result in neutropenia, often on an autoimmune basis, although a component of bone marrow failure may also be present. The bone marrow in antibody-mediated neutropenia will usually show normal cellularity with a late myeloid arrest or appear normal with neutrophils present or even increased. T cell disorders may show decreased marrow reserve.

However, subsequent study revealed that this mutation is an acquired somatic mutation that may be associated with the development of acute leukemia (see <a href=\"#H16059892\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below), but is clearly not the underlying basis for the disease itself. </p><p>The first mutations identified in SCN were in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELANE, formerly termed ELA2). To date, there are over 100 mutations identified based on data from the <a href=\"https://depts.washington.edu/registry/&amp;token=3LnavMR4lJzMwcjXSJ9A9sPc6vbj2UCuaY0DDLsFjBAZY69QfgRW4JvRB/5h4BvV&amp;TOPIC_ID=8373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry</a>.

In a study of 25 patients with congenital neutropenia, 22 had 18 different heterozygous mutations of the ELANE gene; mutations were not found in three patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The genetic defects of SCN and other congenital neutropenias have been reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/1,4,12,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,12,13,21</a>].</p><p>In reports of eight patients who were conceived from the same sperm donor, all children had the same mutation of ELANE (fourth exon at site S97L) and none of the mothers had an ELANE mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. Linkage analysis confirmed that all affected children had the same paternal allele leading to the expression of SCN, supporting the autosomal dominant inheritance of ELANE mutations. </p><p>The mutation in the original kindred described by Kostmann is in HAX-1 and is recessively transmitted. The HAX-1 (HCLS1-associated X1) gene is critical for maintaining the inner mitochondrial membrane potential and protecting against apoptosis in myeloid cells.

The cumulative incidence of death from sepsis after 15 years of therapy with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was 10 percent (95% CI 6-14%).

Later follow up of this same cohort showed improved survival but development of neurological symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The prognosis is now significantly better because of treatment with G-CSF. This agent results in improvement in the granulocyte counts in over 90 percent of patients. </p><p>However, now that the patients are surviving into adulthood, it is clear that malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells is a significant factor in overall survival. Patients with SCN have a predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia, which is predominantly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but also acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and bi-phenotypic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Sequential acquisition of a series of mutations was documented in hematopoietic cells from a patient with SCN by serial exome sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In a review of 374 patients enrolled in the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry, 61 <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> events were reported among 374 patients with SCN (16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

A reasonable approach is to start at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> and escalate by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> every three to five days until there is a response. It is important to note that G-CSF can induce cycling of the ANC that makes it hard to adjust the dose. Thus, if the ANC is erratic once a response has been obtained, it may be necessary to use a constant G-CSF dose for a few weeks and measure the ANC two to three times a week to determine whether the ANC is oscillating.</p><p>A response can be obtained in almost all patients, with most patients responding to a dose between 3 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day and fewer than 5 percent of patients not responding to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-neutropenia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].
