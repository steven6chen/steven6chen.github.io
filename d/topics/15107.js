A rib fracture is when a person breaks a rib bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82794\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82794 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Most rib fractures happen after an injury to the chest. If this injury is severe, it can also damage organs in the chest or belly.</p><p>Some rib fractures, called &quot;stress fractures,&quot; do not happen after an injury. Instead, they are caused by a severe cough or a motion people do over and over, like swinging a golf club.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931545\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a rib fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom of a rib fracture is pain. The pain is usually worse when you press on the injured area or take a deep breath. Some people also have bruising over the injured area.</p><p>A stress fracture also causes pain, but the pain usually starts slowly and gets worse over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931560\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a rib fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she might order a chest X-ray.</p><p>Some people need other imaging tests, such as a CT scan, bone scan, or ultrasound. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931575\"><span class=\"h1\">How are rib fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on how many ribs you broke and your other injuries.</p><p>People with 3 or more broken ribs or other serious injuries usually need treatment in the hospital.</p><p>People who do not need treatment in the hospital are treated with pain-relieving medicines. Treating the pain is important, because when people have rib pain, they try to keep their ribs from moving too much. Then they don't breathe in and out as deeply as they should. When people don't breathe in and out as deeply as they should, some of the small airways in the lungs can close off. This raises the chances of getting a lung infection, called &quot;pneumonia.&quot;</p><p>To treat your pain, your doctor can use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong pain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, also called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; &ndash; NSAIDS are a large group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p>Your doctor will probably also recommend a treatment to help prevent your small airways from closing off. This treatment, called &quot;incentive spirometry,&quot; involves breathing deeply into a hand-held device a number of times each day.</p><p>Treatment for a stress fracture involves avoiding the activity that caused your stress fracture for 4 to 6 weeks. Then you can slowly restart that activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931590\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do rib fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rib fractures can take weeks to months to heal, depending on how mild or serious the fracture is.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal very quickly. Older adults or adults with other medical problems can take much longer to heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931605\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. He or she will probably recommend that you eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>). He or she will also probably recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid doing certain activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931637\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a cough that is getting worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain or are very weak.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your skin looks more pale than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20931652\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
