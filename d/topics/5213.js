The approach to diagnosis of LTBI is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>LTBI is a clinical diagnosis that is established by demonstrating prior TB infection and excluding active TB disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Available tests to demonstrate prior TB infection include the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). These measure immune sensitization (type IV or delayed-type hypersensitivity) to mycobacterial protein antigens that might occur following exposure to (and infection by) mycobacteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76107 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Issues related to use and interpretation of the TST are reviewed here; issues related to interpretation of IGRAs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMING THE TST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TST consists of intradermal injection of tuberculin material, which stimulates a delayed-type hypersensitivity response mediated by T lymphocytes and, in patients with prior mycobacterial exposure, causes induration at the injection site within 48 to 72 hours.</p><p>In North America, the tuberculin material is purified protein derivative (PPD); the standard dose is 5 tuberculin units (0.1 mL). In other regions, RT-23 may be the tuberculin material used; the standard dose is 2 tuberculin units. These doses have been shown to be equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Tuberculin skin testing is performed via the Mantoux technique, which consists of intradermal injection of tuberculin material on the inner surface of the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. To read the test, the transverse diameter of the induration (not erythema) should be demarcated, measured, and recorded in millimeters. The test should be read 48 to 72 hours following intradermal injection. The results are less reliable if the test is read after 72 hours. A strongly positive reaction after 96 hours may be accepted; however, results become increasingly doubtful with longer intervals between injection and reading. In one study including 400 individuals with positive TST at 48 to 72 hours, about 20 percent had negative results when the TST was read seven days after placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If the TST cannot be read within 48 to 72 hours, repeat testing should be performed. If the TST is repeated after seven days, then the boosting effect may cause a positive TST (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Booster response'</a> below). However, in the absence of a documented negative first TST, there is no way to know if the TST represents a boosted reaction. Hence, the TST must be interpreted in the same way as a single initial TST. This potential problem reinforces the importance of reading at the correct time.</p><p>Multipuncture methods (including the Tine test and the Heaf test) should not be used; they may be easier to administer but are not accurate because it is not possible to precisely control the amount of tuberculin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The TST may be repeated with no effect on subsequent testing. Administration of one or more TSTs does not stimulate type IV hypersensitivity to tuberculin (ie, repeated testing does not sensitize individuals to the test reagent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3609373672\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, adverse reactions to TST are rare; the most important is hypersensitivity to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> materials (&lt;1 per million).

The algorithm provides information on positive predictive value of a test result along with predicted risk of progression to disease.</p><p>Sensitivity of TST for the 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm threshold is 98, 90, and 50 to 60 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As the cutoff for mm of induration increases, the sensitivity decreases and the specificity increases. A higher cutoff is useful for evaluation of individuals in regions with low rates of true TB infection. Guidelines in the United Kingdom for TST interpretation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults#H840128458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;, section on 'United Kingdom'</a>.)</p><p>If the TST is negative, the possibility of a false-negative result must be considered, as discussed in the following section.

Technical limitations include improper tuberculin handling and interpretation.</p><p>Anergy testing with control antigens such as mumps and <em>Candida</em> was previously thought to help determine between true-negative and false-negative tuberculin tests. However, the role of anergy testing in the diagnosis of LTBI is not well defined, and such testing is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>Measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be given after, or on the same day as, the TST. If MMR has been given recently, TST should be postponed until four to six weeks after administration of MMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of individuals with negative test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of recent close contact to individuals known to have infectious tuberculosis, treatment for LTBI should be considered for adults who are severely immunocompromised (such as HIV infected or organ transplant recipient), even with negative TST or IGRA.</p><p>For these patients, LTBI therapy should be initiated (following clinical evaluation to rule out active tuberculosis) and the TST or IGRA repeated after eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the second test is positive, treatment should be continued; if the second test is negative, treatment is usually stopped, although continued therapy may be considered on an individual basis, based on degree of immunosuppression and assessment of individual risk.</p><p>The approach to treatment is discussed in detail separately.

Estimates of the frequency of false-positive TSTs due to NTM range from 1 to 5 percent of positive tuberculin tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] to as many as 50 percent of 9 to 14 mm reactions in United States health care workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Therefore, the effect is important only if the prevalence of true TB infection is low (ie, less than 5 percent) and the prevalence of sensitivity to NTM antigens is high; this situation occurs in low-incidence countries with tropical, subtropical, or temperate climates such as the southern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BCG vaccination &ndash; BCG vaccination is a well-known but frequently misunderstood cause of false-positive tuberculin reactions. The effect of BCG on TST depends primarily on the age when vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. BCG vaccination in the first year of life may produce low-level TST reactivity in adults; such reactions are typically &lt;10 mm and rarely persist past the age of 10 years. Vaccination after the first year of life (such as at entrance to primary school at age 5 to 6) may cause a stronger and longer-lasting effect; as many as 20 percent of individuals remain TST positive 10 years or more after vaccination at this age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In pediatric populations, the interval since vaccination is important since there is progressive waning over the first 10 years after vaccination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Current and past BCG vaccination policies for most countries of the world may be reviewed online at the World Atlas of BCG Policies and Practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most persons with a history of childhood BCG immunization have a lasting vaccine scar (typically over the deltoid; in some countries, BCG scars may appear on the forearm or upper outer thigh).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TST reactivity caused by BCG sensitization can be distinguished from LTBI by IGRAs.

This includes evaluation for symptoms (eg, fever, cough, weight loss), physical examination, and radiographic examination of the chest. Patients with untreated positive TST or IGRA should undergo chest radiograph to exclude active TB within six months prior to initiation of therapy.</p><p>A chest radiograph is considered abnormal if it demonstrates parenchymal abnormalities, particularly opacification of the upper lobe or superior segment of the lower lobe. Radiographs demonstrating stable upper lobe fibro-nodular disease or calcified granulomas are considered to demonstrate evidence of previous active tuberculosis and indicate the patient is at increased risk of reactivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60941 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Patients with symptoms or radiographic signs suggestive of active disease should undergo further diagnostic evaluation including sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, mycobacterial culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing. Symptoms related to extrapulmonary sites should also be evaluated as appropriate.

In all facilities, health care workers should undergo baseline skin testing at hiring. This may include two-step testing if there is no documentation of a negative TST result within the previous year. In low-risk settings, subsequent testing is only performed if there is exposure (postexposure testing). In moderate-risk settings, annual testing is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116496\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116496 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3151703202\" class=\"local\">'Repeat and serial testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical approach for HCWs with occupational exposure to a patient with active contagious TB varies depending on their prior TST status and the interval since the exposure episode. In general, if primary TB infection develops following clinical exposure, TST conversion occurs three to eight weeks later. Therefore, for HCWs with prior documented negative TST, the simplest clinical approach consists of TST performed eight weeks following the end of exposure; alternatively, some favor performing TST at three weeks following exposure, and, if negative, retesting at eight weeks. If positive at &ge;5 mm, this should be interpreted as a recent TST conversion (and a diagnosis of LTBI).</p><p>The role of interferon-gamma release assay for serial testing in health care workers is uncertain; further study is needed. This issue is discussed further separately.

Immediate hypersensitivity skin reactions to the TST are possible; these consist of wheal and flare response at the testing site within 20 minutes of purified protein derivative (PPD) placement. In a case series of 3248 allergy clinic patients, immediate hypersensitivity to skin testing with PPD was observed in 2 to 3 percent of patients, without systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In areas where TB incidence and the annual risk of infection are high, routine serial testing is usually not performed because of limited resources in these settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To establish a correct baseline prior to serial testing (&quot;two-step testing&quot;) &ndash; In individuals with remote exposure to mycobacterial antigens (eg, due to prior BCG vaccination, nontuberculous mycobacteria infection, or remote TB infection), the tuberculin reaction may have waned due to reduction in number of sensitized T lymphocytes in the absence of new antigen exposure (faded immune memory), and an initial tuberculin test may be negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-the-tuberculin-skin-test-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. However, placement of the initial tuberculin test stimulates anamnestic recall of immunity, such that a second tuberculin test (&quot;booster&quot;) will be positive. Therefore, in the setting of a positive tuberculin test performed a year after initial screening, it may be difficult to distinguish between recent infection (ie, occurring since the previous TST) and remote mycobacterial exposure. For this reason, evaluation for the &quot;booster phenomenon&quot; should be performed by repeating the TST (on the opposite forearm) one to four weeks after the first test. The induration observed with the second test is the baseline that should be used for subsequent evaluation of skin test conversion.</p><p/><p>Individuals who were immunocompromised when they underwent testing for TB infection may have false-negative test results (TST or IGRA).
