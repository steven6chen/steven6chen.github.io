The pituitary contains lactotroph cells that produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates lactation (production of breast milk).</p><p>Prolactinomas (also called &quot;prolactin-producing adenomas&quot; or &quot;lactotroph adenomas&quot;) are benign (non-cancerous) tumors of the pituitary gland that produce prolactin, thereby causing higher than normal blood prolactin concentrations. They can cause symptoms, either when the high blood prolactin concentration interferes with the function of the ovaries or testicles or, less commonly, when the adenoma grows large enough to compress the pituitary gland or nearby structures in the head, such as the nerves to the eyes.</p><p>Prolactinomas occur in both men and women but are more commonly diagnosed in women who are less than 50 years than in older women or men.</p><p>Prolactinomas can usually be treated successfully with medication alone. Medication lowers the prolactin level in the blood substantially, often to normal, and also usually reduces adenoma size. However, a minority of these adenomas do not respond to medication and must be treated with surgery or, less commonly, radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HIGH PROLACTIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolactinomas develop when one of the normal prolactin-producing cells in the pituitary gland develops a mutation. The mutation allows the cell to divide repeatedly, resulting in a large number of cells that produce an excessive amount of prolactin. Approximately 10 percent produce growth hormone as well as prolactin.</p><p>Most prolactinomas occur sporadically, but rarely, they occur in families as part of a condition called the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.</p><p>Most prolactinomas remain small, less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inches) in diameter; these are called microadenomas. A minority grow larger, occasionally to several centimeters, and are called macroadenomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of prolactinomas fall into two categories: those that result from elevated blood prolactin levels, and those that result from compression of the normal pituitary and surrounding tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms caused by elevated blood prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated blood prolactin interferes with the function of the ovaries in women and the testicles in men. Therefore, it causes symptoms in premenopausal women and in men, but not in women who have already been through menopause, since their ovaries have already stopped functioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a high blood prolactin concentration interferes with the function of the ovaries in a premenopausal woman, secretion of estradiol (the main form of the hormone estrogen) decreases. Symptoms include irregular or absent menstrual periods, infertility, menopausal symptoms (hot flashes and vaginal dryness), and, after several years, osteoporosis (thinning and weakening of the bones). High prolactin levels can also cause milk discharge from the breasts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a high blood prolactin concentration interferes with the function of the testicles, the production of testosterone (the main male sex hormone), and sperm production. Low testosterone causes decreased energy, sex drive, muscle mass and strength, and blood count (anemia). If levels remain low for several years, bone strength may decrease (osteoporosis). High levels of prolactin in the blood also cause difficulty in getting an erection, as well as breast tenderness and enlargement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms caused by compression of surrounding tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large adenomas can cause symptoms by pressing on nearby structures in the head. Pressure on nerves to the eyes can impair vision, especially peripheral (side) vision. Pressure on the pituitary gland can decrease production of the hormones that stimulate the thyroid gland and adrenal glands, leading to underactivity of the those glands. Pressure can also cause headaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF PROLACTINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prolactinoma is diagnosed based upon an elevated blood level of prolactin and evidence of a mass in the pituitary gland, as seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Because other conditions can cause an elevated prolactin level, those potential causes must be evaluated as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of prolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prolactin level can be measured in a single blood sample. The result can range from slightly elevated to a thousand times the upper limit of normal. In general, larger adenomas cause higher prolactin levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is the best test for identifying masses in or near the pituitary gland, although MRI cannot determine if the mass is a pituitary adenoma or another abnormality. Furthermore, some small adenomas (microadenomas) cannot be detected by MRI, and not all adenomas secrete prolactin or other hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluating other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the medications that are used to treat psychiatric conditions can cause high blood prolactin levels. Other causes of high prolactin include the hormone estrogen (if taken by mouth) and underactivity of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROLACTINOMA TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment are to lower the level of prolactin in the blood to normal and to decrease the size of a large adenoma, especially if it is compressing surrounding structures. It is important that the clinician and patient discuss the possible benefits and risks of treatment.</p><p>Not all prolactinomas require treatment. If the tumor is large or causing symptoms, it should probably be treated, but if it is small and is not causing symptoms, it does not need to be treated.</p><p>When treatment is necessary, most prolactinomas respond well to therapy with medications called dopamine agonists. If an adenoma does not respond to any of these medications or if the medication causes intolerable side effects, other treatments should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS TO TREAT PROLACTINOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dopamine agonist is the best first treatment for a prolactinoma of any size. Two dopamine agonists are currently available for this purpose in the United States, cabergoline and bromocriptine; another one, quinagolide, is also available in other countries.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bromocriptine &mdash; Bromocriptine has been used for many years to treat prolactinomas. It is taken twice a day. While it is usually very effective in lowering blood prolactin levels, it can cause side effects, including dizziness, nausea, and nasal stuffiness. Many of the side effects can be avoided by taking the medication with meals or at bedtime and by starting with a very low dose. Bromocriptine appears to be the best choice of dopamine agonists for restoring fertility in women who want to become pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Becoming pregnant'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cabergoline &mdash; Cabergoline is taken once or twice a week and is much less likely to cause nausea compared with other dopamine agonists. It may be effective for treating prolactinomas that are resistant to bromocriptine. For all these reasons, cabergoline is the best first choice, except in women who are trying to become pregnant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of dopamine agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dopamine agonists are very effective for decreasing prolactin levels and the size of most prolactinomas. Cabergoline, which appears to be the most effective dopamine agonist, lowers prolactin levels in approximately 90 percent of people who have prolactinomas, often to a normal level. It also usually decreases the size of micro- and macroadenomas to normal. Prolactin levels usually fall within the first two to three weeks of treatment, but detectable decreases in adenoma size take more time, usually several weeks to months. When the adenoma affects vision, improvement in vision may begin within days of starting treatment.</p><p>If the prolactin level decreases to normal or near normal levels, the symptoms caused by the elevated prolactin are reversed. The upper normal value for serum prolactin in most laboratories is approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units). In premenopausal women, ovarian function returns, estrogen levels increase, menstrual periods return to normal, and fertility returns. In men, testicular function returns, causing an increase in energy, sex drive, muscle mass, blood count, and bone calcium. The ability to have an erection returns and, eventually, breast enlargement regresses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects of drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major side effects of dopamine agonists are nausea, lightheadedness after standing, and mental fogginess. These side effects are most likely to occur when treatment first begins and when the dose is increased. They can be minimized by starting with a small dose, increasing the dose slowly if needed, using small doses more frequently, and taking the drug with food or at bedtime. Women who still have trouble tolerating their medication may try taking the pills intravaginally (by inserting them into the vagina) rather than by mouth. This might decrease or prevent nausea. However, it is best to talk with a doctor or nurse before trying this.</p><p>Psychiatric effects and severe constipation sometimes occur, but they are uncommon. Unfortunately, starting with a low dose does not prevent these side effects, and if they occur, they seem to continue as long as the medicine is taken. They do go away when the medicine is stopped.</p><p>Cabergoline has been associated with valvular heart disease in people with Parkinson disease who took much larger doses (more than 20 mg a week) than used for prolactinomas (typically 0.5 to 2 mg a week). So far, there are no confirmed cases of valvular heart disease in people being treated for hyperprolactinemia. However, experts recommend using the lowest dose of cabergoline necessary to lower prolactin to normal; they also recommend doing ultrasound (echocardiogram) of the heart valves in patients with prolactinomas who need higher than usual doses of cabergoline.</p><p>Heart valve problems have not been seen in people taking bromocriptine, even in high doses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">How long is medication needed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the prolactin level remains normal and no tumor is seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for two or more years, a trial period without medication can be considered. However, the high prolactin level often recurs after the medication is stopped. Monitoring of the prolactin level and, less frequently, the size of the pituitary, would continue during this time. If the prolactin levels begin to rise or the adenoma grows in size, a dopamine agonist should be resumed.</p><p>If the dopamine agonist is not effective in lowering the prolactin level, or if the person cannot tolerate the side effects, surgery to attempt to remove the adenoma may be considered. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgery for prolactinoma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Considerations specific to women</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug therapy and menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have <strong>micro</strong>adenomas usually do not have to continue taking dopamine agonists after menopause. After menopause, there is no longer a concern about irregular or absent periods. The prolactin is usually measured a few months after treatment is stopped to be sure that it is not substantially higher than before treatment. This is usually done once per year for a few years and less often thereafter. Women who have <strong>macro</strong>adenomas should continue taking dopamine agonists after menopause to keep the size of the adenoma from increasing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen and progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogen, in combination with progestin, is a treatment option for women who have small prolactinomas, especially women who have intolerable side effects when taking dopamine agonists and those who do not want to become pregnant.</p><p>The rationale for estrogen treatment is that the only known harmful effect of an elevated blood prolactin in a woman is decreased ovarian function, including diminished secretion of estrogen. Estrogen doses and regimen are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Menopausal hormone therapy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prolactin concentration should be monitored periodically because of the small chance that the adenoma could grow. Estrogen and progestin treatment are not recommended as the only treatment in women with macroadenomas (&gt;1 cm).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Becoming pregnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman who has a prolactinoma and wants to get pregnant can usually do so with little risk to herself or her developing child. However, the woman should speak with an endocrinology specialist before attempting to become pregnant. Issues to address include which treatment is best before trying to conceive, when to discontinue dopamine agonist treatment, the chance that the adenoma will grow during pregnancy, what would be done if it does grow, and whether or not breastfeeding is advisable. These considerations are influenced greatly by whether the adenoma was less than 1 cm (microadenoma) or greater than 1 cm (macroadenoma) prior to treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microadenomas </strong>rarely increase in size during the course of pregnancy. The best treatment to restore fertility in women with a microadenoma is a dopamine agonist. Bromocriptine does not appear to increase the risk of miscarriage or birth defects when it is taken to restore fertility and discontinued early in pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Less information is available about the safety of cabergoline, although the available information does not indicate that it increases the risk of birth defects. Bromocriptine, therefore, appears to be the safest dopamine agonist to use to restore fertility, although a woman who has severe side effects from bromocriptine could reasonably choose cabergoline. Dopamine agonist treatment should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed. There is insufficient information about the safety of these medications during later stages of pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If dopamine agonists do not lower prolactin sufficiently to restore ovarian function, other medications, such as clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins, may be recommended to induce ovulation. Once the woman becomes pregnant, the dopamine agonist should be discontinued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ovulation induction with clomiphene (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During the course of the pregnancy, it is possible for the prolactinoma to increase in size. To monitor for an increase in size, the woman should let her health care provider know if she develops new or worsening headaches or changes in vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macroadenomas </strong>may increase in size during the course of pregnancy. Signs that the adenoma is growing include new or worsening headaches or changes in vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If vision worsens, the woman should see an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). An MRI may be recommended to determine if the prolactinoma has grown. If so, bromocriptine is usually recommended to decrease the size. There is little information about the effect of bromocriptine on the fetus during the second and third trimesters; however, the available information suggests that bromocriptine does not harm the fetus. If necessary, surgery to remove the adenoma can be performed during the second trimester.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the adenoma was greater than 2 cm in diameter or was affecting vision prior to treatment, surgery should be considered before the woman tries to become pregnant. Surgery is recommended because growth of the adenoma during pregnancy can potentially interfere with vision or cause headaches. Following surgery, a dopamine agonist may be recommended to restore fertility. Alternatively, if the adenoma is very sensitive to cabergoline or bromocriptine, a low dose can be continued during the entire pregnancy or it can be administered only if the adenoma increases sufficiently to cause visual symptoms during the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Surgery for prolactinoma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a woman wishes to breastfeed, she should not resume dopamine agonist treatment until breastfeeding is completed. If there was an increase in the size of the adenoma during pregnancy sufficient to cause visual symptoms, most experts recommend that the woman not breastfeed, so that she may restart dopamine agonist treatment immediately after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY FOR PROLACTINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is an option when dopamine agonists are ineffective or not tolerated. Surgery may also be the best choice for a woman with very large macroadenoma that is not entirely responsive to dopamine agonists who wants to become pregnant, because dopamine agonists must be discontinued during pregnancy, and during this time the adenoma may grow.</p><p>During surgery, a small incision is made in the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75464 \">figure 2</a>). The incision is extended through the sphenoid sinus, allowing the surgeon to visualize and remove the adenoma. Most experienced pituitary neurosurgeons now perform this procedure using an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a camera).</p><p>Surgery can often reduce the blood prolactin concentration, sometimes to normal. This is more likely for a microadenoma than a macroadenoma. Even if the prolactin is lowered to within the normal range shortly after surgery, the level may become elevated in the next several years. Potential side effects of surgery include worsening of vision, hemorrhage, and meningitis, which are all uncommon, and hormonal deficiencies. The risk of complications is less when the procedure is performed by a surgeon who has had significant experience operating on the pituitary gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy can shrink prolactinomas and lower blood prolactin levels, but these effects usually take several years. Therefore, radiation is used only as secondary treatment of macroadenomas, to prevent regrowth of substantial residual tissue that could not be removed during surgery of a macroadenoma that is not responsive to dopamine agonists.</p><p>The possible side effects of radiation treatment include temporary nausea, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, and loss of hair on specific parts of the scalp. Approximately half of all people who receive pituitary radiation therapy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies within 10 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2182\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
