As an example, certain common hemoglobinopathies such as hemoglobin S trait (sickle cell trait, HbAS), hemoglobin C trait (HbAC), and hemoglobin E trait (HbAE) may produce results that do not accurately indicate the true level of metabolic control in a patient with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-8-discordant-values-for-a1c-and-home-blood-glucose-values-comment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. This is not an uncommon problem. It is estimated that about 1 in 12 African Americans has HbAS. HbAE is one of the most common hemoglobin variants in the world. It is common in South and Southeast Asia and in the United States, particularly on the West Coast, reflecting recent migration patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-8-discordant-values-for-a1c-and-home-blood-glucose-values-comment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Numerous assays are in use for the determination of the A1C level. Due to the efforts of many investigators and commercial laboratories and to the important role of the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP), the values are standardized nationally and can generally be compared from laboratory to laboratory. The assays fall into three main classes, (1) immunoassay, (2) ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and (3) boronate affinity HPLC and boronate affinity binding methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimation-of-blood-glucose-control-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimation of blood glucose control in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycated hemoglobin'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of HbAS, HbAC, or HbAE interferes with some of these assays and produces spuriously elevated A1C values. This may lead to inappropriately aggressive treatment for presumed hyperglycemia with an increased risk of hypoglycemic episodes. The magnitude of the error may be as much as 2 percent in certain assays, sufficient to alter the interpretation from satisfactory to unsatisfactory metabolic control. The most serious offenders are certain immunoassays. HbAS and HbAC result from a single amino acid substitution for the glutamic acid at position six on the beta chain of hemoglobin by either a valine (HbAS) or a lysine (HbAC). HbAE results from a single amino acid substitution for the glutamic acid at position 26 on the beta chain of hemoglobin by a lysine. These amino acid substitutions may alter the shape of the protein sufficiently to change its binding characteristics with the reagent antibody. Interference with the A1C assays is not consistent within method types (eg, immunoassay) and with ion-exchange methods may vary over time due to changes in column or reagent lots.</p><p>It is helpful for the clinician to know the method used for the determination of the A1C level in his or her practice. If the method is one that does not indicate whether a variant hemoglobin is present (ie, all immunoassay and affinity chromatography methods) and if the patient is a member of a racial or ethnic group with a high prevalence of one of these variants, the hemoglobin phenotype should be determined before testing by a hemoglobin electrophoresis. Alternatively, one can use an A1C method that detects the presence of common hemoglobin variants.</p><p>In the present case, the A1C values obtained by the initial clinician were performed by an immunoassay method with spuriously elevated results. The value you ordered that detected an abnormal hemoglobin was performed by an ion-exchange HPLC method. Future testing should be done with a method that is not influenced by the presence of HbAS, such as affinity chromatography. The patient, a computer engineer, solved the problem by searching for &quot;glycohemoglobin + African Americans&quot; on Google, which produced several relevant references.</p><p>This case emphasizes the effects of certain common hemoglobinopathies on the A1C test. Many less common and rare hemoglobinopathies produce spuriously abnormal A1C results, both high and low values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-8-discordant-values-for-a1c-and-home-blood-glucose-values-comment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In situations where the A1C is discordant with the glucose values obtained by the patient and in the chemistry laboratory, it may be helpful to obtain a hemoglobin electrophoresis.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-8-discordant-values-for-a1c-and-home-blood-glucose-values-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Frank EL, Moulton L, Little RR, et al.
