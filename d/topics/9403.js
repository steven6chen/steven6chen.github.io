Management of food allergy consists of strict avoidance of the food allergen and treatment of accidental exposures with medications. Allergies to certain foods, such as egg and milk, tend to be outgrown during childhood, whereas allergies to other foods, such as shellfish and nuts, are much more likely to persist. Several approaches are under investigation for the treatment of food allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Novel therapeutic approaches to food allergy can be classified as food allergen specific (eg, immunotherapy with native or modified recombinant allergens, or oral desensitization) or food allergen nonspecific (eg, anti-immunoglobulin E [IgE], traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80640 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The ultimate goal of therapy is to induce permanent tolerance to the food, where the allergy will not recur upon re-exposure after a period of abstinence. However, some therapies in development appear to only temporarily desensitize or protect patients, requiring continued treatment to maintain efficacy. Before these new approaches are applied in clinical practice, they must be carefully evaluated for side effects, such as acute adverse reactions, toxicity, and overstimulation of T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses that could prime for autoimmunity.</p><p>Oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy is reviewed separately. Other food-specific therapies, as well as nonspecific therapies, are reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for food allergy: Oral immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4062569488\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF TREATMENT FOR FOOD ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of treatment for food allergy is to induce permanent tolerance to the food, which means that there is no recurrence of clinical reactivity upon reintroduction of the food after a period of abstinence. Important goals for patients and their families are reduction of anxiety related to food allergies and improvement in quality of life. These goals may be accomplished even if the patient does not develop permanent tolerance but rather a temporary state of desensitization or protection. They may also be accomplished even if dietary restrictions are not lifted by increasing the eliciting dose and thereby reducing the risk of reactions to the food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOD ALLERGEN-SPECIFIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aim of allergen-specific immunotherapy is to alter the allergic response to the food allergen so that the patient becomes desensitized or, preferably, tolerant to the specific food. Some patients may not be fully desensitized in that they cannot tolerate ingestion of a normal serving size of the allergenic food. These patients nevertheless may benefit from an increase in the threshold dose of food required to cause an allergic reaction as they have some protection from accidental exposures. This enhanced safety often also improves quality of life. Partial reintroduction of the food may have some nutritional value as well.</p><p>Food allergen-specific therapies under investigation include oral, sublingual, and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Allergens used for SCIT have been modified to retain immunogenicity but decrease allergenicity. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for food allergy: Oral immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sublingual immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach to food immunotherapy is sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with food extracts. There are few effector cells, such as mast cells, in the sublingual mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Allergen extracts given sublingually are not systemically absorbed. Rather, they are taken up by dendritic cells in the mucosa and presented to T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Likely mechanisms of action include downregulation of mast cells and activation of T regulatory cells. SLIT has been attempted for peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>], hazelnut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], cow's milk (CM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and kiwi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] allergies.</p><p>Both OIT and SLIT are expected to be safer than subcutaneous administration, with lower rates of systemic reactions reported for SLIT than OIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/8,12,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,14,16</a>]. However, most studies report higher efficacy of OIT regarding desensitization and induction of tolerance compared with SLIT, although with higher rates of side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>].</p><p>As with OIT, patients are started on a very low dose of allergen, and the dose is advanced every week or two to the maintenance dose over several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/8-10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,14</a>]. Occasionally, a faster schedule of dose advancement is used (rush schedule) to reach the maintenance dose within a matter of days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The maintenance dose for SLIT is much lower than that used for OIT. As an example, 1.4 to 3.7 mg versus 2000 mg of peanut protein was used for SLIT and OIT, respectively, in several studies (as a reference, an average size peanut contains approximately 250 to 280 mg of protein, and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter contains 8 grams) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Variable measures have been used to determine efficacy of SLIT, including an increase in the median cumulative challenge dose tolerated, the rate of response (includes both subjects who are able to ingest the full challenge dose and those who are able to ingest a 10-fold higher dose than they could at baseline), the rate of full desensitization (tolerate ingestion of the full challenge dose, which ranged from 5 to 20 mg for peanut studies), and the rate of sustained unresponsiveness (SU, tolerate ingestion of the full challenge dose after avoiding the food for four to eight weeks after discontinuation of therapy). In small, randomized trials of SLIT versus placebo, the rate of desensitization ranged from 0 to 42 percent for SLIT compared with approximately 10 percent in the placebo group, and the rate of response ranged from 41 to 70 percent for SLIT compared with 15 percent in the placebo group after four to seven months of maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. One peanut SLIT study found a SU rate of 10 percent after three years of therapy, although 65 percent of the original 40 subjects did not continue therapy during the extended phase of this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Randomized trials of SLIT versus OIT demonstrated similarly low rates of desensitization (0 to 10 percent) and SU (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>].</p><p>However, it should be noted that SLIT trials have generally used the desensitization endpoints defined as ability to ingest a regular serving of food without an allergic reaction, similarly to the OIT trials. This is in contrast with peanut epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) trials that defined treatment success as a 10-fold increase in the eliciting dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eliciting dose of 1000 mg or greater of peanut protein. When reanalyzing SLIT results according to the EPIT treatment success criteria, SLIT shows a superior efficacy. Clinical trials of SLIT using adjuvanted peanut preparations are in the planning phase.</p><p>While allergic symptoms are common with SLIT, occurring in 33 to 40 percent of doses, they are primarily isolated to the oropharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/10,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13</a>]. Systemic reactions are rare with SLIT, with only one reported reaction that required treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Epicutaneous immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epicutaneous delivery of protein for immunotherapy (EPIT) is under investigation in patients with CM and peanut allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>] and is in preclinical studies for egg. CM EPIT is under study for both immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy and for eosinophilic esophagitis. The epicutaneous delivery system (EDS) solubilizes the allergen by perspiration and disseminates it into the thickness of the stratum corneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Epicutaneous delivery is less invasive than subcutaneous injection and may have a lower risk for systemic reactions than subcutaneous, oral, or sublingual food allergen delivery. Preliminary reports suggest that the epicutaneous antigen delivery for food allergy immunotherapy can lead to desensitization, although it is unknown whether this therapy can induce SU. This therapy appears to be more effective in children 6 to 11 years old than in older children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Two trials have demonstrated an increase in the eliciting dose after treatment with peanut EPIT. In the multicenter US trial conducted by the Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR), 74 peanut-allergic individuals (ages 4 to 25&nbsp;years) were treated with peanut EPIT (100 or 250 mcg) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The primary outcome was treatment success defined as passing a 5044 mg protein oral food challenge or achieving at least a 10-fold increase in the eliciting dose from baseline to week 52. Treatment success was achieved in 3 (12 percent) placebo-treated participants, 11 (46 percent) EPIT 100 mcg participants, and 12 (48 percent) EPIT 250 mcg participants, with median changes in eliciting doses of 0, 43, and 130&nbsp;mg of peanut protein in the same groups, respectively. Treatment success was higher among children younger than 11 years at enrollment. Overall, 14 percent of placebo doses and 80 percent of peanut EPIT doses resulted in reactions, predominantly local patch-site and mild reactions. Increased peanut-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)&nbsp;levels and <span class=\"nowrap\">IgG4/IgE</span> ratios were detected in peanut EPIT-treated participants, along with trends toward decreased basophil activation and peanut-specific T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines.</p><p>In the second trial, conducted at multiple centers in North American and Europe, 221 patients aged 6 to 55 years with peanut allergy were randomly assigned to peanut EPIT (50, 100, or 250 mcg) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The primary outcome was treatment success defined as the eliciting dose during the posttreatment food challenge equal or greater than 1000 mg of peanut protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 10 times or more greater than the eliciting dose prior to treatment. Treatment success was achieved in 14 (25 percent) placebo-treated patients, 24 (45 percent) EPIT 50 mcg participants, 23 (41 percent) EPIT 100 mcg participants, and 28 (50 percent) EPIT 250 mcg participants. However, only the 250 mcg EPIT was significantly different than placebo (absolute difference 25 percent; 95% CI 7.7-42.3 percent). When stratified by age, a significant difference remained for the 6-to-11-year-old group (absolute difference 34.2 percent; 95% CI 11.1-57.3 percent) but not the <span class=\"nowrap\">adolescents/adults</span>. The mean eliciting dose at month 12 was greater for the 250 mcg patch (1117.8 mg) than for the placebo patch (469.3 mg) overall (least squares [LS] mean difference 336.2, 95% CI 110.9-739.7) and for the children stratum (250 mcg patch: 1211.9 mg; placebo patch: 239.1 mg; LS mean difference 333.7, 95% CI 92.5-887.6). Nearly all patients had reported adverse events, primarily local skin reactions. No dose-related serious adverse events were reported.</p><p>Reports from earlier mouse studies demonstrated increased potential for the development of IgE sensitization to peanut via the epicutaneous route compared with ingestion and indicated that cutaneous exposure to food antigens could reprogram gut-homing effector T cells in lymph nodes to express skin-homing receptors, raising concerns as to whether epicutaneous delivery may worsen food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, results from other murine studies suggest that the protective effects of EPIT are dependent upon application of the allergen to the intact skin and not eczematous skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/23,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,27</a>].</p><p>One difference between EPIT and OIT or SLIT is that there is no dose escalation phase; the initial dose is the maintenance dose. Doses are also lower than those used for OIT or SLIT. Ongoing trials are investigating 250 mcg for peanut and up to 500 mcg for milk applied daily for 24 hours to intact skin (eczematous skin is avoided). The patches are applied on the upper back in the interscapular area in children &le;11 years of age, and the site of application is rotated daily. In children older than 11 years, the patches are applied on the inner surface of the arm.</p><p>To date, none of the trials reported serious adverse events, although one subject who received milk EPIT had repeated episodes of diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The most frequent adverse events were localized erythema, eczema, pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urticaria at the site of application. Adherence was high, and dropout for adverse events was generally low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Subcutaneous immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early clinical trials with SCIT demonstrated that immunomodulation can be effectively used to induce oral tolerance to peanut but, at the same time, highlighted the serious side effects associated with food allergen immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Systemic allergic reactions were common both during the build-up phase and with maintenance injections. Subsequent studies have focused on minimizing adverse side effects that are largely IgE mediated. These investigational therapies have been tested in animal models, but most have not been tested in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838646288\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemically modified, alum-adsorbed immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chemically modified, aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed peanut extract given by weekly subcutaneous administration is under evaluation in subjects 5 to 50 years of age with peanut allergy in a safety and tolerability randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Preliminary results of a small clinical trial evaluating safety and immunomodulation with alum-adsorbed, chemically modified peanut extract found that local and systemic reactions were observed more often in the active group, although no late (&gt;4 hours after therapy) systemic reactions were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Peptide immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elimination of IgE binding can be achieved with vaccines consisting of overlapping peptides (protein fragments 10 to 20 amino acids long) that represent the entire sequence of a specific protein.

The two main techniques are site-directed mutagenesis and polymerization. These modified proteins are more potent when applied together with immunomodulatory adjuvants.

Further studies focused on vaccine administered per rectum. It was felt that rectal delivery would provide superior safety regarding possible infectious complications since nonpathogenic <em>E. coli</em> bacteria reside in the colon and would be associated with lower rates of severe adverse reactions.

In another mouse study, intradermal immunization with a mixture of ISS and beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), but not with either alone, provided protection against fatal anaphylaxis induced by intraperitoneal beta-gal sensitization and challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSPECIFIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aim of nonspecific therapies for food allergy is primarily to downregulate the allergic immune response. Some therapies in development have only a transient effect, but others may be curative. Allergen-nonspecific therapies include anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and vasoactive mediator blockade. Additional novel approaches include use of a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist to decrease T helper type 2 (Th2) responses and induce T helper type 1 (Th1) responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and blockade of vasoactive mediators such as platelet-activating factor (PAF) from mast cells and basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-IgE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies play an important role in the pathophysiology of food allergy. IgE antibodies bind to high-affinity receptors (Fc-epsilon-RI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Crosslinking of IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells by allergen leads to the release of preformed mast cell mediators (the early phase of an allergic reaction) as well as synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that result in late-phase reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Humanized monoclonal anti-IgE (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, talizumab) is not used as monotherapy for food allergy. However, it may have a role in pretreatment before oral immunotherapy (OIT) and has been shown to decrease the rate of adverse events during peanut, milk, and multifood OIT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy#H3441474081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for food allergy: Oral immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'OIT plus anti-IgE'</a>.)</p><p>Humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies (anti-IgE) bind to IgE molecules, preventing them from binding to IgE receptors; downregulate the expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells; and decrease basophil histamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Anti-IgE therapy alone is not a cure, and protection requires administration at regular intervals indefinitely. However, its appeal is that it should be effective for allergy to any food. Prior to clinical application, further studies are necessary to confirm and optimize the protective effect of anti-IgE against food allergy, establish a safety profile in young children, and identify markers for selecting patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-IgE therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-ige-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anti-IgE therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One clinical trial has reported the results of using anti-IgE antibody as monotherapy for peanut allergy. This multicenter, randomized trial evaluated humanized monoclonal anti-IgE mouse immunoglobulin G1 antibody (talizumab) in 84 patients with challenge-confirmed immediate hypersensitivity to peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either talizumab (150, 300, or 450 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks for four doses. Patients underwent a second oral peanut challenge within two to four weeks after the fourth dose. The mean baseline threshold of sensitivity increased in all groups with an apparent dose response that was only significant in the 450 mg group (increased from 178 to 2805 mg, or half a peanut to nearly nine peanuts, an effect that should provide protection against most accidental ingestion). However, even at the highest dose of talizumab, approximately 25 percent were not protected. A controlled trial of different anti-IgE humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) in children older than six years with peanut anaphylaxis showed a significant increase in the threshold dose for peanut in the anti-IgE group compared with placebo in participants who completed the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, the trial was discontinued prematurely because of safety issues related to anaphylactic reactions during baseline food challenges. The studies suggest that anti-IgE can alter the threshold for many treated patients, but more studies on safety and efficacy are needed. Cost may also be an issue since long-term monotherapy would be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2673979308\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-IL-4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupilumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dupilumab</a> is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the alpha subunit of the interleukin (IL) 4 receptor and inhibits downstream signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines of type 2 helper T lymphocytes (Th2) that are believed to play a key role in atopic diseases. It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and is in phase-II trials in children with atopic dermatitis. It is also in phase-II trials for eosinophilic esophagitis and is in clinical trials for treatment of IgE-mediated food allergy.

The mechanism of action of TCM is largely unknown, in spite of extensive clinical experience with TCM in Asia. In addition, TCM has not been rigorously evaluated in randomized clinical trials. The use of Chinese herbs for the treatment of food allergy is discussed in greater detail separately.

Novel therapeutic approaches to food allergy can be classified as food allergen specific or food allergen nonspecific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80640 \">table 1</a>). The ultimate goal of therapy for food allergy is to be able to consume the food <em>ad libitum</em> without symptoms or fear of a reaction. However, a reduction in the risk of allergic reactions, even if the food cannot be fully reintroduced into the diet, may be a sufficient outcome for many patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Food allergen-specific therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral immunotherapy (OIT) &ndash; Patients have been successfully desensitized with this approach, but a smaller percentage achieves oral tolerance (or at least sustained unresponsiveness [SU]). The rate of serious allergic reactions is low, and home administration is possible.
