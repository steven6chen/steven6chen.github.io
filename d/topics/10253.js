The MHC is highly polymorphic from individual to individual and segregates in families in a Mendelian codominant fashion.</p><p>The following is a general overview of MHC structure and function. Details of MHC use in transplantation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MHC CLASSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus are located on the short arm of chromosome 6. They encode two distinct classes of cell surface molecules: class I and class II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Class I molecules are expressed on the surfaces of virtually all nucleated cells at varying densities, while class II molecules are more restricted to cells of the immune system, primarily B lymphocytes and monocytes. However, cytokines secreted by lymphocytes and monocytes during immune activation can cause dramatic increases in class II HLA antigen expression, even on cell types that normally have little or no surface expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are three different class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II (HLA-DQ, -DR, -DP) antigens. Studies in renal transplantation indicate that mismatches at the A, B, and DR loci are associated with worse allograft survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hla-matching-and-graft-survival-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HLA matching and graft survival in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is now understood that the principal task of the immune system is to distinguish self from non-self. HLA molecules provide the crucial surface upon which the antigen receptors on T lymphocytes recognize foreign (non-self) antigens. On antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, class II molecules present antigenic fragments to the CD4+ inducer (or helper) T cells, while class I molecules function at the effector phase of immunity by presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells, which generally have cytotoxic or suppressor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This process of antigen presentation consists of the binding of a single T-cell receptor to a complex on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell consisting of the MHC molecule and a peptide fragment derived from the foreign antigen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53512 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63541 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>An ever-expanding number of immune-related genes has been found in additional areas of the MHC in the class III and class IV regions through the use of molecular biologic techniques, such as screenings of complementary DNA (cDNA), cosmid, and yeast artificial chromosome libraries and genomic sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These contiguous regions lie between the class I and class II genomic areas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The class III region contains several components of the complement system, C4, C2, and Bf. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-clinical-assessment-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and clinical assessment of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The class IV region, located between the class III and I areas, comprises a relatively large cluster of immune-related genes. These include the genes for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and -beta, as well as numerous less characterized genes or gene families, such as <em>B144</em>, <em>AIF1</em>, and the MIC family.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MHC STRUCTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crystallization of the class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 molecule has permitted visualization of how antigen presentation might occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a distinct groove on the external face of the molecule that is 20 x 10 x 10 angstroms in size. This site can bind antigen peptide fragments containing eight to nine amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], although it appears that recognition involves the binding of only two amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; how this might occur is not known. The sides of the groove are formed by two alpha-helical structures, and the floor is formed by eight antiparallel beta pleats. Other class I alleles, and at least the class II HLA-DR1 molecule, have a virtually identical core structure; however, the bound peptide in the class II molecules is longer, containing 13 to 26 amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Membrane-bound class I consists of an alpha chain (mol wt 44 kD) with three domains: a3 is close to the cell membrane, while a1 and a2 contain polymorphic sites and form the peptide-binding groove, each contributing one alpha helix and half of the beta pleated floor. The class I complex also consists of non-covalently associated beta-2-microglobulin (mol wt 12 kD), which stabilizes the complex by fitting under the a3 domain.</p><p>Class II molecules have a somewhat different structure. They contain two transmembrane chains (alpha and beta for each locus); each chain is approximately 24 kD in size and has two domains. The two distal domains associate non-covalently to form the peptide-binding pocket described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is no association of class II molecules with beta-2-microglobulin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ANTIGEN PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foreign antigens initially do not exist in small fragments.
