Estrogen is the most effective treatment available for relief of menopausal symptoms, most importantly hot flashes. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT; estrogen alone or combined with a progestin) is currently indicated for management of menopausal symptoms. Long-term use for prevention of disease is no longer recommended</p><p>The impact of MHT on cardiovascular risk will be reviewed here. The discussion will include both cardiovascular outcomes and the effect of estrogen therapy on serum lipid values, blood pressure, and body weight. Other aspects of estrogen therapy are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Factors including the older age and greater weight of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) population, as well as the estrogen type, route of administration, and dose may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular effects of estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of effects of estrogen could affect the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known how these effects influence the overall risk of CHD with MHT. Examples of potential beneficial effects of estrogen include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An improvement in lipid profiles, primarily with oral estrogens (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Lipids'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced endothelial function, which may occur in young healthy women, but not older postmenopausal women with coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved insulin sensitivity, although data are inconsistent</p><p/><p>Examples of potential adverse effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in serum triglyceride concentrations with oral estrogens (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Lipids'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombotic effects including a reduction in serum fibrinogen, factor VII, and antithrombin III with oral estrogen (less affected by transdermal estrogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in hepatic synthesis of vascular inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) (primarily oral preparations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic progestins, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (the progestin used in the WHI trial and Heart and <span class=\"nowrap\">Estrogen/Progestin</span> Replacement Study [HERS] described below), may negate some of the effects of estrogen on lipids and endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Natural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> has been less well studied but does not appear to negate the effects of estrogen on serum lipids. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Lipids'</a> below.)</p><p>Both unopposed conjugated estrogen and combined conjugated estrogen-progestin therapy increase CRP concentrations. In one study, the increase in CRP was positively or negatively correlated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) with combined estrogen-progestin therapy or unopposed estrogen, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This suggests a noninflammatory pathway for stimulation of CRP with unopposed estrogen, but an inflammatory one when progestin is added.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beginning in the late 1980s, there was a shift from prescribing short-term estrogen therapy for menopausal women for symptoms to prescribing it long-term (more than five years) for prevention of disease, particularly CHD. This prevention strategy was based on over 30 observational studies, almost all of which demonstrated a striking protective effect of estrogen on the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In addition to the observational data, angiographic and autopsy studies suggested an antiatherogenic effect of estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>However, initial publications from the WHI trial suggested that MHT is not effective for primary prevention of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The WHI trial was a set of clinical trials, including two estrogen therapy trials, in healthy postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years.</p><p>One of the trials (combined continuous estrogen-progestin regimen [conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day]</span> versus placebo in over 16,000 women) was discontinued three years early due to an increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, CHD, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) over an average follow-up of 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although there were significant benefits (reduction in risk of fractures and colon cancer), there was concern that the risks of estrogen-progestin therapy outweighed the benefits in some women.</p><p>The WHI unopposed estrogen (conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg) versus placebo trial in nearly 11,000 women who had undergone hysterectomy (and therefore did not require a progestin) was also discontinued (one year early), due to an increased risk of stroke and a calculation that suggested no overall health benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Combined estrogen-progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the initial reports from the WHI, the hazard ratio (HR) for CHD (nonfatal myocardial infarction or death due to CHD) in the overall cohort taking combined estrogen-progestin trial was 1.24 (95% CI 1.0-1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, subsequent analysis suggests that the increased risk may be confined to older women. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Timing of exposure'</a> below.)</p><p>Other factors, including body mass index (BMI), presence of vasomotor symptoms, additional coronary risk factors (including diabetes, hypertension, family history, and smoking), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or statin use, and CRP were not significantly related to CHD risk with hormone therapy (HT). Biochemical predictors of risk and the possible effect of age and years from menopause are discussed below.

However, after a median follow-up of 12 months, an excess risk of CHD events and VTE, but not stroke, was observed in the overall cohort receiving combined estrogen-progestin group compared with placebo.

There was a suggestion of a protective effect in the younger women (ages 50 to 59 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The use of MHT in the early menopausal years does not appear to be associated with an excess risk of CHD when compared with older postmenopausal women. This has been referred to as the &quot;timing hypothesis.&quot;</p><p>The WHI population was an older population (mean age 63 years) when compared with most observational studies; the older age at the time of MHT initiation would be expected to be associated with more subclinical atherosclerosis at baseline, with advanced or complex atherosclerotic lesions that may be more susceptible to the prothrombotic, proinflammatory effects of estrogen. In contrast, starting MHT soon after menopause may not cause harm (or may possibly be beneficial) because advanced, unstable atherosclerotic plaques have not yet formed. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations from the WHI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a combined analysis of the two WHI HT trials, women who started MHT closer to menopause appeared to have a lower risk of CHD compared with women further from menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the age groups of 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 70 to 79 years, the HRs for CHD were 0.93, 0.98, and 1.26, with absolute excess risks of -2, -1, and +19 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. This trend did not reach statistical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women &lt;10, 10 to 19, or &ge;20 years since menopause, HRs for CHD were 0.76, 1.10, and 1.28, with absolute excess risks of -6, +4, and +17 per 10,000 person-years, respectively (p for trend = 0.02).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the WHI-Coronary Artery Calcium Study, an ancillary substudy performed in younger women ages 50 to 59 years, evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis (as measured by coronary-artery calcium scores on electron beam computed tomography [CT]) was lower in those assigned to unopposed estrogen when compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), a four-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 727 women ages 45 to 54 years, reported that when combined with cyclical monthly oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>, oral conjugated estrogen (0.45 mg daily) or transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (50 mcg daily) reduced menopausal symptoms and improved some markers of cardiovascular disease (increased HDL, decreased LDL with oral estrogen; decreased insulin resistance with transdermal estrogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, HT had no effect of surrogate markers of atherosclerosis progression (coronary artery calcium and carotid intima-medial thickness [CIMT]) when compared with placebo. The authors suggest that the lack of protective effect could be due to the young age and low risk profile of the subjects, the short duration of the trial, and the low doses of estrogen used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In The Early versus Late Intervention Trial with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Estradiol</a> (ELITE), 643 postmenopausal women, stratified according to time since menopause (&lt;6 or &gt;10 years; early versus late, respectively), received oral estradiol (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> for women with a uterus) or placebo for a median of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (measured as CIMT) was slower than placebo in the early intervention group, while rates of progression were similar to placebo in the late intervention group. Estradiol had no effect on CT coronary artery calcium in either the early or late intervention group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2015 meta-analysis of 19 trials of oral (including the WHI), but not transdermal, MHT in over 40,000 postmenopausal women performed subgroup analyses in women who started MHT less than 10 years after menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;, section on 'Younger, postmenopausal women'</a>). A lower risk of CHD and mortality were reported. A 2017 meta-analysis of similar trials concluded that the risks of long-term use of MHT for prevention of chronic disease outweighed any benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Most now agree that age or time since menopause influences the risk-benefit ratio associated with HT, most importantly with respect to CHD. The use of unopposed estrogen may be more favorable than combined estrogen-progestin (at least for the synthetic progestin used in the WHI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>). In spite of these reassuring data, MHT is indicated only for management of menopausal symptoms in younger women, not for primary prevention of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. For women who are recently menopausal, the improvement in vasomotor symptoms must still be weighed against other potential risks of treatment, but coronary disease is not usually a major factor in the equation.</p><p>Other specific recommendations regarding estrogen therapy are discussed elsewhere.

Both the WHI and the HERS trials employed conjugated equine estrogen-progestin therapy (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> below). In comparison, the Estrogen in Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT) randomly assigned 222 healthy, postmenopausal women to unopposed oral 17-beta-estradiol (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Estradiol</a> therapy was associated with a decreased risk of atherosclerosis (as measured by CIMT). Higher serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and estrogen were inversely correlated with CIMT progression after controlling for age and BMI. The association was partially mediated by beneficial effects on lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>However, 17-beta-estradiol may not be effective when given with a progestin. This was illustrated in a trial of 321 postmenopausal women in whom the combination of 17-beta-estradiol (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with a progestin (gestodene) produced no reduction in intima-medial progression after one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Data from one population-based, case-control study suggest a possible lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esterified-estrogens-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esterified estrogens</a> when compared with conjugated estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hormone-therapy-and-cardiovascular-risk/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
