Reconstructive breast surgery following total or partial mastectomy can be performed using tissue flap or implant-based techniques, and each has its own set of complications. Aesthetic breast surgery includes breast augmentation, reduction, and mastopexy, which are performed using tissue rearrangement techniques or by using breast implants. </p><p>The complications related to reconstructive and aesthetic breast surgery will be reviewed here. Issues related to the indications for and choice of a type of breast reconstruction are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2493286585\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most women who have reconstructive or aesthetic breast surgery do not experience significant complications and are highly satisfied, a range of problems can occur any time after the procedure is performed. Accurate complication rates may be difficult to identify and compare between studies due to variables such as differing types of reconstruction, surgeon experience, and patient factors and comorbidities, as well as the duration of patient follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].</p><p>Representative studies are as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of over 18,000 procedures, the incidence of noninfectious complications was 10.3 percent after mastectomy plus implant, 11.7 percent for mastectomy plus implant and flap, and 17.4 percent after mastectomy plus flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another large review, the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) following immediate reconstruction was similar following implant and autologous reconstruction (8.9 and 9.3 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For delayed reconstruction, the incidence of SSI was 5.7 percent following implants and 13.9 percent following autologous reconstruction. Wound complications resulted in more secondary procedures following immediate implant versus immediate autologous reconstruction (1.92 versus 1.11, respectively); however, the incidence of SSI after secondary procedures was lower for implants compared with autologous reconstructions (3.2 and 11.6 percent, respectively). </p><p/><p>In general, complications following reconstructive or aesthetic breast surgery can be classified as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications inherent to surgery and common to all, in general (eg, infection, venous thromboembolism, hematoma, delayed healing, abnormal scar). (See <a href=\"#H547847062\" class=\"local\">'Local surgical complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications specifically related to the reconstruction (eg, flap ischemia, fat necrosis, capsular contracture, implant failure). (See <a href=\"#H1122491320\" class=\"local\">'Flap-related complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7527440\" class=\"local\">'Implant-based complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications related to donor tissue sites. (See <a href=\"#H328881420\" class=\"local\">'Donor-tissue-related complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570701971\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk for complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain patient factors, and others specifically associated with the treatment of breast cancer, increase the risk for some complications. Patient factors include smoking, obesity, and older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Radiation therapy also increases the overall risk. However, in most studies, neither neoadjuvant nor adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to influence complication rates following flap-based or implant-based breast reconstruction, although wound healing may be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-19</a>]. In one study of 899 patients, premature removal of tissue expanders occurred more frequently among those receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy compared with no such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another study of 233 patients, of whom 38 percent were treated with hormone therapy, the incidence of wound healing complications was significantly increased in the hormone therapy group (61 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Wound healing complications included fat necrosis (26 versus 8.3 percent), surgical site infection (15 versus 2.8 percent), delayed wound healing (49 versus 13 percent), and development of grade <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> capsular contracture (55 versus 9.1 percent). </p><p>Other factors that influence the overall rate of complications include type of mastectomy, type of implant, type of flap, use of fat grafting, breast size (implant-based), bilateral surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and prior abdominal surgery (transverse rectus abdominis muscle [TRAM] flap). The influence of mastectomy weight also influences complication rates. In a review of 704 consecutive patients and 1041 mastectomies, the overall complication rate following mastectomies that were &lt;500 grams, between 500 and 100 grams, and &gt;1000 grams was 14, 17.6, and 25.7 percent, respectively (p = 0.002) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Patients older than 65 may have an overall increased risk for perioperative complications compared with younger patients, likely related to medical comorbidities, but age does not appear to be a predictor of reconstructive failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/5,10,14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,14,24</a>]. As an example, for flap-based reconstruction, rates of flap thrombosis do not appear to be significantly different in older compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The use of acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) is sometimes implicated as a risk factor for complications following tissue expander and implant reconstruction. In a prospective multicenter study known as the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium (MROC), there were no significant differences in overall complication rate, major complications, wound infections, or reconstructive failure at two years following reconstruction when comparing ADM and non-ADM cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Prepectoral reconstruction, which is an innovation whereby the tissue expander or implant is placed above the pectoralis major muscle rather than beneath it, also does not appear to be associated with any increased risk for complications. In a review that compared immediate prepectoral tissue expander placement (51 patients, 84 breasts) to subpectoral placement (115 patients, 186 breasts), there was no significant difference in overall complications (17.9 versus 18.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Specific complications included hematoma in 2.4 percent, seroma in 3.6 percent, cellulitis in 4.8 percent, and explantation in 1.2 percent. In another review of 353 prepectoral reconstructions, complications included infection in 4.5 percent, seroma in 2 percent, mastectomy skin necrosis in 2.5 percent, and no capsular contractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209525262\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of radiation therapy, implant-based reconstruction is more prone to adverse events including, but not limited to, capsular contracture, malposition, distortion, pain, and incisional dehiscence, regardless of the timing of administration of radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/27-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-41</a>]. </p><p>In a review of 218 women following total skin-sparing mastectomy and implant reconstruction, 85 had prior radiation therapy and 133 had postmastectomy radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients with prior radiation therapy had more complications after the first stage of reconstruction compared with after the second stage, including higher rates of explantation (15 versus 5 percent) and infection (20 versus 8 percent). Patients receiving postmastectomy radiation therapy had low complication rates after the first stage, when they had not yet received radiation; however, complication rates after the second stage of <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> exchange were significantly higher, and nearly fourfold higher compared with patients with prior radiation therapy. </p><p>Autologous tissue appears to withstand radiation-induced tissue damage better than implant-based reconstructions, and there does not appear to be an increase in the risk of major complications; however, flaps may experience radiation-related fat necrosis, fibrosis, atrophy, and flap contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/12,43-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,43-53</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3688461609\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking is universally considered to be a risk factor for surgical complications, and smoking adversely affects wound healing and blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/11,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,54-56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications#H179550987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications&quot;, section on 'Smoking and nicotine replacement therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of perioperative complications and is associated with an increased risk of reconstructive failure. For implant-based reconstruction, the incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis, infection, and loss of implant are increased with tobacco use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Many reconstructive surgeons insist that patients have quit smoking before proceeding with autologous or implant-based reconstruction. However, the risk for some complications may persist even among those who quit smoking before surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H44799842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Patient and family counseling'</a>.)</p><p>To illustrate these points, in a study of 155 smokers, 76 ex-smokers, and 517 nonsmokers who had breast reconstruction with TRAM flaps following mastectomy, various complications were assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Mastectomy flap necrosis developed in significantly more smokers compared with ex-smokers and nonsmokers (7.7 versus 2.6 and 1.5 percent, respectively). Fat necrosis following TRAM flap reconstruction was noted in 10 smokers (26.3 percent), 2 ex-smokers (8.7 percent), and 17 nonsmokers (8.4 percent). Abdominal wall necrosis occurred in 7.9 percent of smokers, 4.3 percent of ex-smokers, and 1.0 percent of nonsmokers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720100024\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity increases the incidence of adverse events following autologous or implant-based reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>In a review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;40) was associated with a significantly increased risk of perioperative (30-day) complications compared with nonobese patients; however, there were no significant differences when comparing implant-based and flap-based reconstruction in the morbidly obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In another review of 612 flap reconstructions in 404 patients, patients with a BMI &gt;40 had a significantly increased rate of total flap loss (8.0 versus 0.5 percent), total major postoperative complications (12 versus 3 percent), and delayed abdominal wound healing (72 versus 44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Also notable is that obese patients are more likely to develop necrosis of the mastectomy skin flaps compared with nonobese patients (21.3 versus 9.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Not all breast reconstructions exhibit an increased risk for complications in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. In a small study of 71 women who underwent perforator flap surgery (eg, deep inferior epigastric perforator [DIEP] flap), 33 had a normal BMI &lt;25, 26 were overweight (BMI 25 to 30), and 12 were obese (BMI 30 to 35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Rates of fat necrosis were 11.4 percent for the normal-weight patients, 6.7 percent for the overweight patients, and 6.7 percent for the obese patients, and there were no significant differences in rates of flap complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547847062\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547847068\"><span class=\"h2\">Seroma/hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seromas can develop following virtually any technique for breast reconstruction. Most seromas occur following removal of a drain. The early occurrence of breast seroma is relatively common following implant placement and less common following flap-based breast reconstruction. Seromas can also occur at both the donor and recipient sites of autologous tissue reconstruction. As an example, for latissimus dorsi donor sites, seroma rates as high as 12 to 21 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. In a series of deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps, abdominal wall seroma occurred at the donor site in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Seroma at the tissue donor site may require percutaneous aspiration or reinsertion of a surgical drain. </p><p>Significant fluid accumulation within the breast implant pocket (within the capsule) may cause asymmetry, breast enlargement, and discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Seroma formation adds additional risks of implant rotation, malposition, and infection. The use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) may increase the incidence of seroma formation, and the adherence of the ADM can become compromised if a seroma is not treated. </p><p>Excessive drainage may also result from increased movement of the expander or implant, possibly the result of a too large pocket, but more likely from too much activity by the patient. If seroma develops with drains still in place, the patient should be cautioned to reduce activity. </p><p>Seromas that occur early can be drained percutaneously (with or without ultrasound guidance), with or without placement of a short-term drainage catheter. Care must be taken to avoid damaging an implant. If an infection is suspected, the drained fluid can be sent for culture. If a drain is placed, it is typically left in place for one to two weeks until drainage is &le;30 mL over a 24-hour period. </p><p>Late fluid collections around an implant are rare, and the etiology is not well understood. The evaluation of a late fluid collection may include comprehensive fluid analysis (including cell counts, microbiology) and ultrasound or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging depending on the patient's clinical situation. An oncologic evaluation may be indicated. All seromas occurring more than one year after surgery should be sent for cytology to rule out breast-implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H24299623\" class=\"local\">'Anaplastic large cell lymphoma'</a> below.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of late fluid collection includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with or without biofilm formation (see <a href=\"#H714317612\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implant rupture (see <a href=\"#H547850106\" class=\"local\">'Rupture of silicone gel implants'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial metaplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double capsule formation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implant-associated ALCL (see <a href=\"#H24299623\" class=\"local\">'Anaplastic large cell lymphoma'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic causes</p><p/><p>If infection and malignancy have been ruled out, surgical exploration with complete capsulectomy, implant removal (with possible placement of a new implant), and drain placement may be needed if the fluid collection persists after percutaneous drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. An alternative viewpoint suggests that late fluid collections are most commonly seen with textured surface implants and that the problem is a mechanical issue caused by friction between the rough surface of the textured prosthesis and the fibrous capsule. If this is thought to be the case, then the textured implant can be removed and replaced with a smooth implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547847116\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding and hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of hematoma is overall low (&lt;2 percent). The affected breast is usually enlarged, tender, and may have ecchymosis or bruising. </p><p>Postoperative hematoma typically develops within the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery. Less commonly, a hematoma presents days or weeks after surgery and may be associated with minor injury or trauma to the breast. In a review of 3474 implant procedures, the incidence of a postoperative hematoma was 0.92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The average time to identification was 37 days, but the majority were identified within 14 days. Late hematomas can also occur and are thought to be related to trauma, clotting disorders, overactivity, and use of intraoperative corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. When analyzed for possible etiology for hematoma formation (location, incision, type of implant), no factor was found to predispose to hematoma formation. </p><p>Careful pocket dissection with attention to hemostasis generally prevents these complications. Certain medications, such as platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, and androgenic hormones, may predispose to bleeding, and their use should be discouraged prior to surgery. Drains may be placed in the breast pocket, but there is no evidence that they decrease hematoma recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Postoperative breast compression after breast augmentation is not effective for preventing hematoma, although it is still practiced by some surgeons. In a trial of 130 patients undergoing breast augmentation, postoperative compression did not reduce the frequency of postoperative bruising or hematoma formation; 38 percent of patients complained about the use of compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>Treatment involves exploration of the breast, drainage of the hematoma, and establishing hemostasis. Any underlying coagulation abnormalities must be addressed and corrected. Unfortunately, hematoma formation is associated with subsequent capsular contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7527448\" class=\"local\">'Capsular contracture'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3582696503\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis is a moderately common complication that occurs in 18 to 30 percent of patients following immediate breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In spite of the best planning, which includes a preoperative discussion between the general surgeon performing breast surgery and the plastic surgeon performing the reconstruction, areas of skin necrosis on the mastectomy skin flap can still occur. It is wise to discuss this complication and inherent risk with the patient in advance. </p><p>The incidence of this complication has increased with techniques such as nipple-sparing mastectomies and direct-to-implant reconstruction, which have become common practice in many centers. Studies have demonstrated that the incidence of mastectomy skin flap necrosis is higher with nipple-sparing mastectomy due to hypoperfusion of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). The incidence is variable and ranges from 0 to 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Factors that predispose to higher rates of skin flap necrosis include increased body mass index (BMI), tobacco usage, and prior breast irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The use of laser-assisted near-infrared fluorescent angiography with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> perfusion has significantly decreased the incidence in overall complications and, in one study, reduced the incidence of mastectomy skin flap necrosis from 15.1 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>Minimizing skin flap necrosis following mastectomy requires preservation of the subdermal plexus, gentle retraction of the skin flaps, and minimization of thermal damage. In the setting of autologous reconstruction, a conservative approach with local care may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Skin/flap</span> necrosis related to the autologous flap reconstruction is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H931020136\" class=\"local\">'Flap necrosis/loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Skin flap problems following implant-based reconstruction often resulted in an exposed tissue expander and threatened the reconstruction in the past. However, exposure is less common with the use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) tissue expander because the ADM usually insulates the device while the skin necrosis is being managed. Care should be taken during the reconstruction to avoid trauma to the skin flap and edges. Expanders should be minimally filled, reducing pressure on the skin flap. It is also wise to possibly avoid skin wound closure strips, which can irritate the edges. </p><p>If swelling, discoloration, or signs of ischemia occur in the early postoperative period, measures to limit further injury might include removing any volume that has been added to the expander, further protecting the incision and skin edges, and avoiding any pressure from external dressings. The application of topical nitroglycerine ointment is effective in reducing the incidence of mastectomy skin flap necrosis. In a randomized controlled trial comparing nitroglycerine with placebo, mastectomy flap necrosis developed in fewer patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> ointment compared with placebo (15.3 versus 33.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. </p><p>If the affected portion of necrotic skin is small and closure is possible without excessive tension, it may be wise to debride and close the incision. It is important to eliminate internal pressure from the expander volume by partially or totally deflating the tissue expander and waiting until complete demarcation has occurred. One must be sure that complete demarcation has occurred, or too early an attempt at closure may result in further loss and a more difficult recovery. If a larger skin flap loss is observed, a more conservative approach may be possible if the expander is protected by muscle coverage or ADM and no signs of infection are present. The larger the skin loss, the further the setback in time of reconstruction. Appropriate cultures and acceptable wound care treatment are necessary to eliminate infection as an etiology or result. Expansion may be resumed once skin closure is achieved. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547847162\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent breast pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast pain that extends beyond the typical postoperative course should be evaluated for underlying causes such as infection, chest wall injury, capsular contracture, and radiation injury. Persistent significant breast pain suggests a nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Infection following autologous reconstruction is uncommon and generally occurs in &lt;5 percent of cases. In a study that evaluated 200 flaps, infection was noted in 3.8 percent of TRAM flaps and 2.4 percent of DIEP flaps. This included the breast or the abdominal donor site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The presence of radiation in the setting of a latissimus dorsi flap and implant does not appear to increase the incidence of infection. In another study, the incidence of infection was 4.1 percent without radiation and 6.1 percent with radiation, a difference that was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In a systematic review that compared prosthetic reconstruction with total muscle coverage versus partial muscle coverage and ADM, the incidences of infection were 3.2 and 3.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a series of 171 consecutive two-stage <span class=\"nowrap\">expander/implant</span> reconstructions, the rate of infection requiring expander removal was 1.2 percent, while 1.8 percent of the tissue expanders were complicated by spontaneous deflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of infection following prosthetic reconstruction is variable and ranges from 0 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In a retrospective review of 292 patients who underwent 469 two-stage prosthetic breast reconstructions, the incidence of infection was 14.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The most common outcome was explantation in 40.9 percent, followed by secondary implant insertion in 21.2 percent with operative salvage in 18.2 percent. Independent risk factors for infection included body mass index, preoperative radiation, necrosis, seroma, and hematoma.</p><p>The diagnosis of implant or tissue expander infection requires prompt treatment. Some redness and swelling is normal and expected initially in the postoperative period, so a careful assessment is required. Peri-implant gas has been reported in the absence of infection and in itself may be related to altitude change, implant rupture, or type of implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Initial management may consist of empiric oral antibiotic therapy. Any fluid collection around the implant should be drained and cultured, whenever possible. This is frequently performed after ultrasound identification of a peri-implant fluid collection. Cellulitis should resolve within a short period of time. If the signs and symptoms progress, the patient should be admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics. Any wound drainage should be cultured, and appropriate specific antibiotic coverage provided. If the patient has skin breakdown or incisional dehiscence, or lack of resolution within 24 to 48 hours of treatment, operative exploration should be considered. Ongoing drainage from the incision raises concerns about an implant or deep infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-implant-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast implant infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although there are reports of salvaging early expander implant infections with appropriate antibiotics and irrigation of the pocket, the presence of a biofilm on the implant may preclude salvage. An infected implant should be removed, and the pocket irrigated and suitably drained. Three to six months may be required to demonstrate the absence of infection, after which time breast reconstruction can resume. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2535684916\"><span class=\"h2\">Mondor disease (superficial thrombophlebitis of the epigastric veins)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mondor disease is an uncommon condition more commonly occurring after breast augmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], but it has been reported following breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. It is more commonly seen with transverse inframammary incisions, which may disrupt vertically oriented superficial veins of the thorax and cause venous stasis followed by thrombosis. In a large series of 2052 breast augmentations, the overall incidence of Mondor disease was 0.63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. For the inframammary incisions (n = 1026), the incidence was 1.07 percent. It presents as a firm or painful cord on the anterior abdominal wall leading up to the breast, typically within the first month after surgery. It generally resolves over a short period of time with supportive care. Although the veins recanalize in one to two months, warm compresses and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications may be offered for symptomatic relief. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122491320\"><span class=\"h1\">FLAP-RELATED COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main flap reconstruction complications pertain to flap viability or relate to the donor tissue site. Other complications include fat necrosis, acute partial flap loss, and lower abdominal laxity or hernias. Although it has not been systematically studied, the impact of latissimus dorsi harvest on shoulder function appears to be minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>The types of flaps (pedicled or free) used in breast reconstruction are described separately. These include the free or pedicled transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) perforator flap, superior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP) flap or the inferior gluteal artery perforator (IGAP) flap, transverse upper gracilis (TUG) flap, and profunda artery perforator (PAP) flap. Given the differing anatomy at each of these sites, the propensity for problems with flap viability differs among these. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-for-flap-based-breast-reconstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options for flap-based breast reconstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, including 3296 patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction, found that patients undergoing autologous free flap reconstruction (n = 609) had the highest overall rates of complications compared with patients undergoing pedicled TRAM flaps (n = 1608) or latissimus dorsi flaps (19.4 versus 13.4 versus 7.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Patients undergoing autologous free flap reconstruction also had a higher rate of reoperation (15.6 versus 9.9 versus 5.7 percent, respectively) and a higher rate of flap failure (5.7 versus 3.4 versus 1.3 percent, respectively). However, the differences were not significant. Flap failure and reoperation rates are typically less than 2 and 5 percent, respectively, when performed by experienced surgeons. In a review of 758 DIEP flaps, the incidence of partial flap failure was 2.5 percent and total flap failure was 0.5 percent. Return to the operating room was necessary in 5.9 percent of patients primarily because of venous congestion in 3.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H931020136\"><span class=\"h2\">Flap necrosis/loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flap loss occurs when a region of the flap does not receive enough blood supply. Because the blood supply to the latissimus is extremely reliable, the incidence of flap loss is relatively low compared with other autologous tissue options for breast reconstruction.</p><p>Major complications from TRAM flap reconstruction are rare. The rate of total flap failure is somewhat higher for free TRAM compared with pedicled flaps (2 to 5 versus &lt;1 percent, respectively), although the free flap is more resistant to partial loss than is the pedicled TRAM flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Total flap loss (&le;1 percent) necessitates surgery to remove necrotic tissue and to perform an additional procedure to reconstruct the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. Acute partial flap loss, usually manifested by small areas of skin loss, is usually treated nonoperatively with dressing changes to promote secondary healing. Fat necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partial flap loss occur when a fatty region of the flap does not receive enough blood supply. The resulting tissue fibrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcification can simulate a mass in the reconstructed breast on postoperative physical examinations.</p><p>Some studies show that DIEP flaps have a less robust blood supply compared with TRAM flaps and therefore an increased risk of fat necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. Other studies suggest that rates of partial flap loss and fat necrosis are no higher for perforator flaps compared with pedicled TRAM procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. One study compared 105 women who underwent bilateral pedicled TRAM flaps with 58 women who had bilateral DIEP flap reconstructions; there were significantly higher rates of partial skin loss, wound dehiscence, and fat necrosis with the DIEP flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In another series of 758 DIEP flaps, 6 percent of patients were returned to the operating room for flap-related problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Partial flap loss occurred in 2.5 percent and total flap loss in less than 1 percent. Fat necrosis occurred in 13 percent (risk factors were smoking and postreconstruction radiation therapy). In a retrospective review of 170 gluteal artery perforator flaps, 8 percent of patients required a return to the operating room with a 6 percent rate of vascular complications and total flap failure rate of 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328881420\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor-tissue-related complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active smoking, obesity, diabetes, collagen vascular disease, postmastectomy radiation therapy, and the presence of certain abdominal scars all increase the risk of complications with the flap and wound healing problems at the lower abdominal donor site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4172113991\"><span class=\"h3\">Hernia/bulge/laxity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hernia is defined as having a fascial defect, whereas a bulge is a fascial laxity but without a fascial defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

When a breast implant is placed, a capsule of fibrous tissue forms around it. The capsule is typically thin and does not cause any symptoms, but in some cases it may progress to a more firm and calcified capsule that can cause breast pain, tenderness, and distortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/102-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-115</a>]. </p><p>Most contractures (92 percent) appear to occur within 12 months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. However, this finding is disputed by a series of 3495 implants in 1529 women that found that the incidence of symptomatic capsular contracture did not diminish after one or two years; rather, the longer the implant is in place, the greater the cumulative risk for developing contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120427576\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many factors that contribute to the development of capsular contracture, including the size of the implant, the patient's scarring tendency, and circulating bacteria, among others. Although not proven, capsular contracture is hypothesized by some to result from a low-grade subclinical bacterial infection and formation of bacterial biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/102,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,116</a>].

Open capsulotomy involves internal circumferential and longitudinal incisions through the capsule. This leaves the capsule in place on the tissues but relieves the constriction of the implant pocket and improves the deformation of the implant. Open capsulectomy is similar to open capsulotomy, but the offending scar tissue and capsule are removed. An open capsulotomy may provide short-term improvement, but the recurrence rate is high. If there is risk in removing the capsule off the chest wall due to significant adherence, a partial (or anterior) capsulectomy may be performed instead. However, in one report of 120 patients with subglandular implants and Baker III or IV contracture, anterior-only capsulectomy had a higher recurrence rate compared with total capsulectomy (46 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. </p><p>After a capsulectomy, a question is often raised if the excised capsule needs to be sent for a pathological examination. The only study to answer this question examined 434 capsules from 264 patients. Most (78.0 percent) were totally benign while 21.6 percent found inflammation, calcification, granuloma, and necrosis. Carcinoma was reported in only in one case (0.4 percent), but this patient was already known to have a recurrent breast cancer extending into the capsule. Unless there are specific signs or symptoms (seroma, tenderness, mass, skin ulceration, painful capsular contracture, or suspicion of malignancy or implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma [ALCL]), there is no evidence to support the routine examination of an excised capsule by a pathologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. </p><p>Implant pocket repositioning from subcutaneous to a dual-plane position may reduce the recurrence of capsular contracture in breast augmentation patients. After capsulectomy, acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is placed to create a &quot;dual plane&quot; pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/133,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,134</a>]. The dual-plane position places the superior two-thirds of the implant located beneath the pectoralis major muscle and the inferior one-third in a subglandular position. The ability of ADMs to decrease capsular contracture may be due to the decreased levels of inflammation found on breast-pocket-integrated ADM surfaces compared with breast pocket capsules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. One retrospective series included saline and silicone gel implants originally in a submuscular position (54 patients) or subglandular position (31 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Conversion to a dual-plane position led to an improvement in Baker grade with 84 of 85 patients free of capsular contracture (Baker I) at an average follow-up of 12 months. In all cases, the implants were replaced with new saline or silicone gel implants. </p><p>Capsulectomy with implant removal and autologous tissue replacement should be offered to breast reconstruction patients in cases where significant capsular contracture continues to be a problem. It may also be offered to breast augmentation patients; however, costs of this option tend to make it prohibitively expensive if being paid for by the patient. Capsulectomy with implant removal and no further implant replacement should be considered in cases where significant capsular contracture continues to recur, causing patient dissatisfaction (or difficulty with breast imaging for cancer screening) despite all possible treatments (ie, capsulectomy with a new implant placed in a dual plane pocket and possible use of ADM) being used to alleviate the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/133,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,137</a>]. When these &quot;out point&quot; criteria are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>], it may be in the patient's best interest to stop with any further surgical treatments, which may be futile and cause further harm and distress to the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547850100\"><span class=\"h2\">Deflation of tissue expanders and saline implants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implant failure leads to a decrease in breast volume with the patient noticing that the breast becomes smaller over a few days. Deflation can occur with tissue expanders or saline implants. Tissue expander deflation can disrupt the reconstruction schedule. The cause may be a defect in the valve, fold fatigue over time, and improper puncture during a fill procedure. When recognized, exploration of the expander and possible replacement should be considered. Saline implants can also deflate with noticeable change in shape and volume. Most manufacturers have a warranty that covers replacement, including facility and anesthesia coverage up to the amounts specified in their warranties. It is important for both groups to include a discussion about deflation issues during the informed consent process. </p><p>A deflation within the first few days after implant placement suggests iatrogenic damage (suture needle or sharp instrument) or an improperly closed valve. Less commonly, a saline implant may leak later on due to a fill valve malfunction, iatrogenic damage (eg, needle puncture), or external physical trauma. After placement, implants commonly develop small pinhole defects in the shell over time. Saline leakage out into the implant pocket will be simply absorbed by the body. Saline implant failure is easy to detect due to the loss of breast volume. No clinical testing is needed, and the implant can be replaced when convenient for the patient; however, it may be better to replace the implant soon after deflation to preserve the size of the original implant pocket. Although most patients have their deflated saline implants removed, there is no evidence that not removing a deflated saline implant (due to patient desire or inability to undergo a procedure) has any negative health effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547850106\"><span class=\"h2\">Rupture of silicone gel implants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to deflated saline implants, failure of a silicone gel implant is difficult to detect, even on physical examination, since the gel typically remains confined within the breast capsule (intracapsular rupture), although in some cases the gel may extrude into the breast tissue and beyond (extracapsular rupture). </p><p>Intracapsular &quot;silent&quot; ruptures are not readily detected, and many patients may not know that their implant is ruptured until it is detected on a routine mammogram or ultrasound. Extracapsular ruptures may cause local inflammation and granuloma formation resulting in a palpable or tender mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/139-141\" class=\"abstract_t\">139-141</a>]. </p><p>Some have recommended that women with silicone gel breast implants should undergo breast implant imaging three years after implant placement and then every two years thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a dedicated breast implant protocol is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality. However, the utility of this recommendation is questionable since implant rupture is uncommon in the first three to five years after placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/143-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">143-145</a>].</p><p>Ruptured silicone gel implants should be removed due to the possibility of the gel material causing inflammation and other tissue reactions, particularly if the material spreads beyond the breast capsule (extracapsular rupture). If rupture is suspected or known, a capsulectomy is typically performed to remove the gel material from the breast pocket. Close observation is an option for those patients who do not wish to have a ruptured implant removed or exchanged due to cost or current overall satisfaction with their breasts. There is no clear evidence that any silicone granulomas that develop contribute to any systemic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/146,147\" class=\"abstract_t\">146,147</a>]. However, cases of systemic symptoms similar to the ASIA <span class=\"nowrap\">(autoimmune/inflammatory</span> syndrome induced by adjuvants) syndrome have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/148,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,149</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=implant-based-breast-reconstruction-and-augmentation#H1616409128\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Implant-based breast reconstruction and augmentation&quot;, section on 'Concerns over breast implants'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3586171096\"><span class=\"h2\">Implant exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implant exposure can be a significant setback to a breast reconstruction schedule. Multiple factors contribute to the development of implant exposure, including too rapid expansion, thinning of the skin with areas of nonhealing, infection, seroma formation, incisional dehiscence, overactivity, and external pressure from activity or bra. Any of these may be a factor and should be evaluated and resolved as much as possible. (See <a href=\"#H3582696503\" class=\"local\">'Skin necrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H714317612\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p>If the expander is in place, removing fluid from the expander may resolve the increased pressure leading to exposure. Unless this underlying etiology is corrected, closing the defect is not advised, as this usually fails. Incisions that have been radiated and then reopened are prone to incisional dehiscence due to compromised fibroblast function and overactivity. Incisional dehiscence in the setting of a permanent implant can be salvaged if the etiology is purely mechanical and not infectious. Counterincisions are often considered in these situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>If dimensional planning and implant size are appropriate and infection, smoking, and external irritation are eliminated, attempts at closure may be fruitful. ADM can be used to reinforce thin tissues in the region of the incision, if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. If the implant exposure is large and the etiology significant, removal of the implant may be warranted, allowing adequate time for closure and appropriate healing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7527533\"><span class=\"h2\">Malposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Implants can become malpositioned laterally, medially, superiorly, or inferiorly. When implant malposition is associated with significant capsular contracture, treatment should focus on addressing the capsular contracture, but resolution of malposition may also require other techniques to achieve optimal results. (See <a href=\"#H7527448\" class=\"local\">'Capsular contracture'</a> above.)</p><p>Implant malposition can occur shortly after surgery or years later. It is common for implants to be in a higher than expected position for a few weeks after placement (especially when in a submuscular plane) and then to settle more inferiorly as the skin and soft tissue swelling and stretch resolve. The use of a breast support device (elastic band) may help facilitate the proper positioning of the implant. If there is continued malposition or asymmetry due to implant position on the chest wall, a surgical revision may be considered once the final implant position has occurred and swelling has resolved. This may be three to six months after the implants are placed. Correction of implant malposition may require one or more of the techniques listed below. Frequently, a capsulorrhaphy is performed to alter the border of the implant pocket to allow for better implant position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. ADM can also be used to reinforce the capsulorrhaphy if the problem is recurrent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. It should be noted that while good results are seen with sheets of ADM for correction of these deformities, the cost of these products is substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral implant malposition &ndash; A laterally displaced implant is frequently due to overdissection of the lateral breast pocket or from prolonged pectoralis major muscle forces on the medial implant causing a lateral displacement. Occasionally, it may be due to oversized implants (too wide for the chest wall) or an unrecognized chest wall deformity that contributes to the appearance of the implants being positioned too laterally. Prevention of this type of malposition includes identification of chest wall deformities, proper implant width selection, careful lateral pocket dissection, and appropriate medial pectoralis muscle release. Correction of lateral displacement depends on the underlying cause and may require a medial pocket release, lateral capsulorrhaphy, new implant pocket creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>], use of ADM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>], and placement of a narrower implant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial implant malposition and symmastia &ndash; Medial displacement is less common and in more severe forms can result in symmastia (also known as &quot;synmastia&quot;) where the definition of the medial edge of each breast is lost and cleavage is absent. It may be due to excessive medial pocket dissection or from the use of implants that are too wide for the patient's chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Prevention of medial malposition and symmastia requires avoiding overdissection of the medial implant pocket and proper choice of implant width. Correction of medial displacement depends on the underlying cause and may include a medial capsulorrhaphy, new implant pocket creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>] (including a &quot;neosubpectoral pocket&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]), and use of a narrower implant. Correction of symmastia is more challenging. If the above techniques are not suitable, placing a sheet of ADM medially in the pocket may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. In severe cases, a staged procedure entails performing a capsulectomy and removing the implant followed by replacing the implants in a fresh pocket without extensive medial dissection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior implant displacement &ndash; A &quot;high-riding&quot; implant is very noticeable as it is difficult to reposition with a bra. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One cause is the placement of a large implant without releasing the inframammary crease to compensate for the implant size. Capsular contracture also commonly displaces the implant superiorly. Prevention of superior displacement should focus on proper inferior pocket creation and muscle release. Care should be taken to preserve the inframammary fold unless there is a specific need to do a careful and controlled lowering of this important structure. If superior displacement is unimproved three to six months after implant placement, the inferior pocket can be extended and the muscle released. If inframammary fold release is needed, it should be done carefully to prevent future inferior implant displacement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Implants in a subpectoral pocket can move superiorly with pectoralis major muscle contraction. Correction of this problem may be achieved by transposing the implant to the subglandular plane and resuspending the pectoralis muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. This eliminates the pectoral forces on the implant and thereby the unwanted implant movement. This technique of switching the implant from a subpectoral position to a prepectoral position is also useful for severe animation deformities resulting from excessive contraction of the pectoralis major muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior implant displacement (bottoming out) &ndash; Stretching of the inferior breast skin (bottoming out) or migration of the implant across the inframammary fold may lead to inferior implant displacement. Prevention of this deformity includes proper breast skin and soft tissue assessment with an appropriately matched implant. Care should be taken if the inframammary fold is released as this may allow for further implant inferior migration. Correction of inferior displacement depends on the underlying etiology. Inferior skin excess due to stretching may require a mastopexy, possibly with a smaller implant. In some cases, the inframammary fold needs to be repositioned superiorly. Sheets of ADM have been used to reinforce corrections of inferior implant displacements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implant rotation malposition &ndash; In the case of round symmetric implants, which are the most common implant shape used, a rotation of the implant inside the pocket will not result in a change in the shape of the breast since the implant is symmetric around the axis of rotation. However, if an asymmetric (also known as a &quot;shaped&quot; or &quot;anatomic&quot;) implant is used, the breast shape may change if the implant rotates inside the breast pocket. This results in the affected breast having more fullness in the area where the projecting pole of the implant is positioned. While not a common occurrence, the prevalence has been reported as high as 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. The exact mechanism of a malrotation is not known, but various factors may contribute to it, including extent of pocket dissection, not using drains, and the physical properties of the implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. Correction of a malrotated implant can be done by external manipulation if the rotation is dynamic. If the rotation is static, surgical options include suture anchoring the posterior tabs of the tissue expander onto the chest wall fascia, tightening the implant pocket using capsulorrhaphy techniques to create a hand-in-glove fit to prevent rotational deformities, implant exchange to round implant, and implant removal with implant replacement in the future if desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24299623\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaplastic large cell lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few reports of a very rare type of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) arising in the scar capsule adjacent a silicone or saline-filled breast implant. The overall risk among women who have breast implants is extremely low, and a causal relationship is far from proven. The usual clinical presentation is a peri-implant mass or fluid collection.

In one series, 86 percent of patients reported acceptable appearance two years postoperatively, compared with only 54 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/157,158\" class=\"abstract_t\">157,158</a>]. In a long-term study of primary breast augmentation, secondary procedures were required in 9 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2876103050\"><span class=\"h2\">Rippling and palpability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common aesthetic concern is the rippling of the implant that can be seen through the breast tissue causing skin irregularities, typically in the lateral border of the breast. This problems is more common in thin patients and subglandular saline implant placement. Textured implants have been associated with an increased risk of wrinkling and waviness and therefore may be less suitable for patients with thin soft tissue coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>To minimize the risk of rippling, patients with a body mass index less than 18.5 may be better suited to submuscular placement or use of a silicone implant if a subglandular position is chosen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Likewise, palpability of the implant, particularly in the lateral and inferior borders of the breast, is more common in thin patients and with saline implants. A change to a silicone implant may improve, but not necessarily eliminate, the palpability. Improvement in rippling has also been done by placing a sheet of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in the appropriate area of the breast pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/133,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,134</a>] and by injection of autologous fat grafts in both aesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>] and reconstructive cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971714155\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast asymmetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymmetry has as much to do with patient expectation as the skill and experience of the surgeon. The more the patient understands the challenges, the better the acceptance of the final result. Patients seeking immediate breast reconstruction may have an expectation of completely matched breasts on the first postoperative day; however, the shape of the reconstructed breast will always be different from the nonoperated breast because of the mastectomy scar and loss of volume interfering with breast projection. </p><p>In addition, most women have some level of preexisting asymmetry in volume, shape, and nipple-areolar complex. One should be careful in evaluating asymmetry, noting whether it is nipple areolar, inframammary fold, or shape and projection. Asymmetries should be noted and pointed out to the patient at the time of examination prior to any breast cancer surgery. It is always a better situation to present the patient findings in advance of the surgery. Preoperative discussions help these patients handle the possible changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-breast-reconstruction#H44799842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of breast reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Patient and family counseling'</a>.)</p><p>It is not unusual for a breast reconstruction patient to have an ongoing challenge to achieve symmetry over her lifetime. Fold asymmetry should be addressed during the initial reconstruction, and certainly during the stage of implant placement. The use of ADM can assist in fixing the fold to exact levels. Secondary procedures on the affected or contralateral breast are often necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-reconstructive-and-aesthetic-breast-surgery/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>]. Once the reconstruction is complete, adjustments to areolar position can be made, and, frequently, different levels of uplift to the opposite breast resolve the asymmetry. Postoperative breast asymmetry is more common following unilateral reconstruction when compared with bilateral, especially following nipple-sparing mastectomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7527722\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstructive breast surgery following total or partial mastectomy can be performed using autologous tissues or breast implants, and each has its own set of complications.
