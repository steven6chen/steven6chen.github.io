It is a common injury that happens most often in children ages 1 to 4 years.</p><p>This injury involves the elbow joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58954\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58954 \">figure 1</a>). It usually happens when someone pulls hard on a child's arm by the hand, wrist, or forearm when the child is not expecting it. The injury can also happen when someone grabs a child's arm suddenly, for instance, when the child is about to fall. These types of movements cause tissue to move between 2 of the bones in the elbow joint, called the radius and the humerus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86688 \">figure 2</a>). This causes symptoms.</p><p>Nursemaid's elbow is common in young children because the tissues holding the elbow joint together are loose in young children. After age 5, nursemaid's elbow doesn't happen. That's because the tissues around the elbow joint are tighter. They don't let the bones move out of place.</p><p>The medical term for nursemaid's elbow is &quot;radial head subluxation.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93611757\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of nursemaid's elbow?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nursemaid's elbow is very painful. When the injury happens, children usually cry and are upset. They usually hold their injured arm straight or slightly bent and close to their body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86687 \">figure 3</a>). They will avoid using the injured arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93611789\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I try to move or straighten my child's arm on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do not try to move your child's arm. You should bring your child to the doctor or nurse right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93611804\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has nursemaid's elbow by asking about the injury and doing an exam.</p><p>Some children need X-rays. Your doctor or nurse will order an X-ray if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>He or she thinks the injury caused a broken bone.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure to fix the injury (described below) does not work.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93611819\"><span class=\"h1\">How is nursemaid's elbow treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nursemaid's elbow is treated with a procedure to move the tissue and bones back into place. This procedure is very quick. The doctor or nurse usually does this in the office or emergency department.</p><p>Children do not usually need pain medicine for the procedure. Although the procedure can hurt, your child will feel much better 5 to 10 minutes after it is done.</p><p>After the procedure, your child will probably not need any further treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93611834\"><span class=\"h1\">Can nursemaid's elbow be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To prevent nursemaid's elbow, do not pull hard on your child's arm or lift him or her up by the hand, wrist, or forearm. Instead, to lift your child up, hold him or her by the upper arms or under the arms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93611849\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-fracture-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Elbow fracture in children (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
