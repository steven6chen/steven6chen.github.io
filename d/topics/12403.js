A meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials comparing laparoscopy to laparotomy for benign gynecologic conditions found the overall risk of minor complications (eg, fever, wound or urinary tract infection) was lower in women undergoing laparoscopic procedures (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A particular issue in laparoscopic surgery is the ability to tolerate the increased intraabdominal pressure due to pneumoperitoneum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for adhesive disease or umbilical or ventral hernia repair. These may impact the choice of site of laparoscopic access and increase the risk of complications related to laparoscopic entry (see <a href=\"#H121809278\" class=\"local\">'Choice of access site and techniques'</a> below).

It is important to carefully position the patient to avoid neurologic injury, provide for ergonomic surgeon positioning, and allow adequate access to the vagina, if necessary.</p><p>The patient&rsquo;s arms may be tucked carefully by her sides with appropriate padding and access to intravenous lines. Many surgeons find this provides the best access to the operative field. If the arms are tucked, they are placed in military position (palms facing toward lateral thighs) with padding protecting the posteromedial aspect of the elbows, wrists and hands. Alternatively, if the arms are abducted and placed on arm boards, careful attention should be paid to maintaining neutral shoulder positioning at a &lt;90&deg; angle to avoid brachial plexus injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Surgical positioning to avoid neural injury is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;, section on 'Prevention of nerve injury'</a>.)</p><p>Dorsal lithotomy position provides access to the vagina for examination or use of instruments. If the dorsal lithotomy position is used, the patient's legs are placed in booted stirrups (eg, Allen stirrups). Stirrups may be fixed or allow for adjustment of the leg position during the procedure. It is important to maintain moderate flexion at the knee and hip with minimal abduction or external rotation at the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. It may also be helpful to utilize a bolster underneath the patient&rsquo;s buttocks to elevate the hips and enhance mobilization of intestines into the upper abdomen. The buttocks should be a few centimeters beyond the edge of the table to allow uterine manipulation.</p><p>At the start of the procedure, the table should be in level position, with the height lowered to allow for relaxed arm positioning for all operators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. We find it convenient to place a video monitor directly facing each surgeon over the patient&rsquo;s contralateral knee at eye level to decrease neck strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Trendelenburg position is typically used to displace the intestines to allow visualization of the pelvic viscera. Several methods may be used to prevent migration in Trendelenburg position: egg-crate foam directly beneath the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], a vacuum-beanbag mattress, or shoulder braces. Steep Trendelenburg (30&ordm; to 45&ordm;) and the use of braces may contribute to brachial plexus injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Further details on patient positioning to avoid neural injury are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;, section on 'Avoid patient malposition'</a>.)</p><p>A bladder catheter is useful to decompress the bladder. Bladder distension increases the risk of bladder perforation and may obscure the operative field. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H860573828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Bladder puncture'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121809411\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery including laparoscopes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52659\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52659 \">picture 1</a>), imaging systems, devices for dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76349\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76349 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79221\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79221 \">picture 3</a>) and hemostasis, suction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77450\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77450 \">picture 4</a>), and tissue removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57113\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57113 \">picture 5</a>) are discussed elsewhere.

It is used to manipulate the uterus and thereby facilitate access to and inspection of pelvic structures. Most cannulas also permit injection of a dye solution (chromopertubation) to assess tubal patency. A variety of uterine manipulators are available. The most widely used reusable manipulators are the Cohen cannula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78608\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78608 \">picture 6</a>) and the Hulka uterine manipulator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72152 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p>A uterine cannula should not be used for uterine manipulation when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intrauterine pregnancy is suspected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus is absent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anomalies exist that prevent exposure of or access to the cervix</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is prepubescent</p><p/><p>Of note, disposal manipulators, such as the RUMI, are more commonly used than the uterine cannula for advanced laparoscopic surgery. For women who have undergone prior hysterectomy, a sponge stick, or examining hand, may be positioned in the vagina to manipulate the vaginal cuff.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121808216\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL ACCESS SITES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121811551\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilical access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecologic laparoscopic entry is commonly at or through the umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Initial entry can also be performed through other sites on the abdominal wall or through the vagina or uterus. It is important to consider alternative access sites when umbilical entry is risky or difficult. (See <a href=\"#H121808902\" class=\"local\">'Non-umbilical access'</a> below.)</p><p>The traditional technique for laparoscopic entry for gynecologic laparoscopy is to blindly pass a sharp Veress needle, typically at the umbilicus, insufflate, and then to pass a sharp trocar. Veress techniques for entry and other direct entry methods, such as open access (Hasson) or the use of optical trocars or radially-expanding trocars, are discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a>). Two systematic reviews of umbilical entry techniques concluded that there is no evidence that one approach is superior to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The choice of approach is best determined by the clinical scenario and surgeon skill set. As an example, patients who are likely to have adhesions may benefit from an open approach because any injury would be more likely identified. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4372471\"><span class=\"h3\">Trocar placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For multi-port laparoscopic hysterectomy (as opposed to a single port technique), port placement typically involves a primary port at the umbilicus with two accessory ports in the bilateral lower quadrants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58323 \">figure 1</a>). To avoid injury to nerves or blood vessels in the abdominal wall (notably the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, superficial and inferior epigastric arteries), the lower quadrant ports are placed approximately 2 cm medial and 2 cm caudal to the anterior superior iliac spine, lateral to the border of the rectus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>A fourth port may be useful, particularly in cases involving extensive dissection or laparoscopic suturing, and can be placed suprapubically or in the lateral abdominal wall at the level of the umbilicus. In cases of enlarged uteri where the fundus approaches the level of the umbilicus, it may be necessary to place the ports higher on the abdominal wall to ensure proper distance for visualization and instrument operation.</p><p>Techniques for abdominal access in laparoscopy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121808902\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-umbilical access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain factors increase the risk for complications when an umbilical access site is used. These include periumbilical adhesions, periumbilical mesh, umbilical or ventral hernia, large pelvic mass, and pregnancy. In addition, umbilical entry may be dangerous, difficult or impossible in women who are obese, extremely thin, highly muscular, or have extreme abdominal wall laxity. Non-umbilical access (abdominal or non-abdominal) may be preferred under these circumstances and the choice of which site to use is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H121810776\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for non-umbilical access'</a> below and <a href=\"#H121810079\" class=\"local\">'Choice of non-umbilical abdominal site'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121811422\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-umbilical abdominal access sites can be used for initial entry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insufflation. Sites commonly used in gynecologic laparoscopy include the left 9<sup>th</sup> intercostal space or the left costal margin at Palmer&rsquo;s point (3 cm below the left costal margin in the left mid-clavicular line) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64551 \">figure 2</a>), but other sites in the midline abdomen and hypogastric region can also be used. Anatomy and techniques for access at these other sites are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891348\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Access locations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121810199\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-abdominal sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-abdominal access through the uterus or vagina has been reported, but is rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121809025\"><span class=\"h4\">Transvaginal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pouch of Douglas or posterior cul-de-sac is posterior to the uterus and cervix. It has long been accessed through the posterior vaginal fornix for diagnostic purposes (culdocentesis) or for surgical access (colpotomy). Access through this site is also referred to as culdolaparoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=culdocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Culdocentesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although rarely used in current practice, the posterior vaginal fornix is a useful site for laparoscopic entry. It has primarily been used for insufflation, but there are reports of vaginal port placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Data regarding this approach are from the 1970s and 1980s, a time when gynecologists were more familiar with culdocentesis and with colpotomy for procedures other than vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Nevertheless, this is still a valid approach for a surgeon who is familiar with the use of this site. There has been renewed interest in vaginal entry for non-gynecologic procedures using a natural orifice transluminal endoscopic approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The posterior cul-de-sac is proximal to the uterine vessels, ureter, and rectum. However, the uterus may be adherent to the rectum if the patient has had prior posterior fornix surgery or if fixed uterine retroversion is present. Thus, these factors are relative contraindications to using the posterior vaginal fornix approach.</p><p>The utility of this procedure was evaluated in a series of patients who underwent laparoscopy using the posterior vaginal fornix entry; insufflation was successful in 103 of 107 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One failure was due to instrumentation, and the other three were due to lateral placement of the Veress needle. No serious complications were reported.</p><p>The following steps are involved in using the posterior vaginal fornix for laparoscopic entry:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the patient in moderate Trendelenburg position to allow the bowel to fall away from the cervix and uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a tenaculum on the posterior lip of the cervix and elevate the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66928\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66928 \">figure 3</a>). This exposes the posterior fornix and places the vaginal mucosa under tension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the Veress needle through the posterior fornix at a point approximately 1.75 cm posterior to the cervicovaginal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Stay in the midline to avoid injury to the uterine vessels or ureters, which are lateral. A longer Veress needle (150 mm rather than 120 mm) is typically easier to use. Do not advance the needle more than 3 cm to avoid injury to the presacral vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufflate; a 10 mmHg pressure reading indicates peritoneal placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the Veress needle and return the patient to horizontal to insert a trocar at another site.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569935152\"><span class=\"h4\">Transuterine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transuterine approach to insufflation is not commonly used and data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>].

The use of optical trocars, radially expanding trocars, or open techniques helps to avoid failed insufflation or injury during umbilical entry. Risk factors that suggest the need to choose a non-umbilical site are discussed in the next section.

Those who have had a prior periumbilical incision (eg, postpartum tubal ligation, laparoscopy, umbilical or other ventral hernia repair) are at particular risk for adhesions of omentum or bowel to the anterior abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>]. </p><p>In a systematic review, the estimated risks for umbilical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior abdominal wall adhesions were 0 to 5 percent for women with no prior surgery, 20 to 30 percent for those with a previous transverse suprapubic laparotomy, and 50 to 65 percent for those with a previous midline laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The reported risk of adhesions after prior laparoscopic surgery ranges from 2 to 21 percent in series of over 100 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Avoidance of umbilical entry in patients who have had a previous laparotomy is supported by a multivariate analysis of over 25,000 laparoscopies in which previous laparotomy was a significant risk factor for a complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It is difficult to quantify the increase in risk of visceral injury in women with versus without adhesions. Thus, while the safest approach is to use non-umbilical entry in women with prior laparotomy, many surgeons do enter through the umbilicus. </p><p>Periumbilical tattoos or jewelry do not cause intraabdominal adhesions, and are not a contraindication to umbilical entry. However, umbilical jewelry should be removed prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H853412\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Piercings and umbilical jewelry'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121811317\"><span class=\"h3\">Prior ventral hernia repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical entry should be avoided in women who have undergone umbilical or other ventral wall herniorrhaphy and have surgical mesh at or near the umbilicus. In such patients, there is a high likelihood of adhesions to the mesh sites and it is also possible that umbilical entry will disrupt the hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121811575\"><span class=\"h3\">Large pelvic mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puncture of a mass should be avoided as it may lead to bleeding or to rupture of an ovarian malignancy, thereby worsening prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Spillage of malignant cells'</a>.)</p><p>The surgeon can calculate the point of contact of the insufflating instrument. The standard Veress needle is 12 cm long from tip to hub, and thus may puncture a mass within this distance from the point of entry. If a 45&deg; angle from the plane of the abdominal wall is used for entry, such a mass would be palpable at approximately 8.5 cm inferior to the umbilicus. However, entry would require adding a margin of safety to this measurement to allow for variations in the insertion angle and changes in the plane of the abdominal wall with elevation or pressure during insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121811581\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of trauma during umbilical entry depends upon the size of the gravid uterus and its position relative to the umbilicus. Laparoscopy in pregnancy is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121810981\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximity of the aortic bifurcation to the umbilicus is a primary factor in determining the risk of injury to the major vessels during initial umbilical entry. Surgeons attempt to avoid vascular injury in non-obese patients by elevating the abdominal wall and inserting the initial instrument at a 45&deg; angle from vertical (aimed in the direction of the pelvis).</p><p>In obese patients, use of an angle more than 45&ordm; from vertical often results in preperitoneal insertion and failure of insufflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. In a review of 138 morbidly obese women (weight greater than 114 kg) undergoing laparoscopy, insufflation failure rates were significantly higher with transumbilical insufflation compared with transuterine insufflation (13.9 versus 3.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>To address this issue in obese women, many surgeons position the initial Veress needle or trocar at an angle closer to vertical. This is based on the assumption that the umbilicus is likely to be inferior to the level of the aortic bifurcation in obese women. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121810987\"><span class=\"h3\">Extreme thinness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are extremely thin are also at increased risk, particularly when the sacral promontory is easily palpable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In such patients, the great vessels may be within centimeters of the umbilicus and use of a 45&deg;<sup> </sup>angle from the vertical may not be protective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121810993\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal wall laxity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women can develop extreme abdominal wall laxity due to prior pregnancy, or current or prior obesity. Upon attempted initial entry in this setting, the abdominal wall may indent with pressure from the instrument. As a result, the instrument cannot enter the peritoneal cavity and umbilical entry is not possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121810079\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of non-umbilical abdominal site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom there is a need for non-umbilical abdominal access, whether planned or not, the first decision is whether to use the site for insufflation alone or for insufflation and trocar insertion. This choice depends upon the indication for non-umbilical entry. If blind insertion of any instrument at the umbilicus is contraindicated, then insufflation and trocar insertion should be performed at a non-umbilical site. On the other hand, insufflation may ameliorate or alter the concerning anatomical relationships (eg, close proximity of the abdominal wall to the aortic bifurcation). Under this circumstance, trocar insertion can then be performed at the umbilicus.</p><p>Palmer's point (3 cm below the left costal margin in the left mid-clavicular line) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64551 \">figure 2</a>) can be used for insufflation and trocar insertion. Other sites are predominantly used only for insufflation in gynecology, followed by trocar insertion at Palmer's point or the umbilicus. This site is contraindicated in patients with previous splenectomy. Care should be taken to empty the stomach prior to attempting insertion at this site.</p><p>An alternate site has been proposed (Jain point) that is lower and more lateral in position compared with Palmer's point and may therefore be more easily used as the main operating port throughout the surgery. Supporting data are limited to a single-case series, and thus routine use is not advised until further studies are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121809284\"><span class=\"h3\">Insufflation with trocar insertion at the same site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women in whom periumbilical adhesions are suspected should have both insufflation and trocar insertion at a non-umbilical site. In this setting, the peritoneal surface of the umbilicus cannot be assessed until the trocar and port have been placed and the camera inserted. &#160;</p><p>Thus, in women with possible adhesive disease or prior periumbilical hernia repair, Palmer's point entry is preferred to other sites since insufflating and inserting the trocar at a single site avoids additional skin puncture.</p><p>Following initial entry, it is often possible to use the umbilicus as a secondary port site in women with suspected adhesive disease. Once the camera is in place, the peritoneal surface of the umbilicus may be found to be free of adhesions or, in many cases, adhesions can be removed. In such patients, an umbilical trocar and port can then be placed safely under direct vision if this is surgically useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121809290\"><span class=\"h3\">Insufflation and trocar insertion at separate sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women without suspected adhesive disease or a history of periumbilical hernia repair, it is potentially useful to insufflate at a non-umbilical site followed by trocar insertion at the umbilicus. This is because insufflation ameliorates the original reasons for avoiding umbilical entry in these patients, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close proximity of the umbilicus to viscera or major vessels &ndash; extreme thinness, pelvic mass, pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H121810987\" class=\"local\">'Extreme thinness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H121811575\" class=\"local\">'Large pelvic mass'</a> above and <a href=\"#H121811581\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Required use of an angle approaching vertical to avoid preperitoneal insufflation &ndash; obesity (see <a href=\"#H121810981\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to penetrate the peritoneum &ndash; abdominal wall laxity (see <a href=\"#H121810993\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal wall laxity'</a> above)</p><p/><p>After insufflation, the initial trocar can be placed at Palmer's point or the umbilicus.</p><p>The second decision, therefore, is which site to use when insufflation alone is planned. As noted above, if Palmer's point is planned for trocar insertion, insufflation should also be performed at this site to avoid unnecessary skin incisions.</p><p>However, if umbilical trocar insertion is planned, the choice of insufflation site depends on surgeon preference. There are no studies comparing the use of different non-umbilical sites in obese or other patients. In current practice, there is greater familiarity with use of the left upper quadrant than the vaginal or uterine approaches.</p><p>The left upper quadrant approach has been reported to be successful in morbidly obese patients with slight modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a series of 600 successful consecutive left upper quadrant Veress needle placements, a site &lt;1 cm beneath the left costal margin, between the mid-clavicular line and the anterior axillary line was used with only one injury to the muscularis of the transverse colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. During insufflation in this study, intraperitoneal pressures between 7 to 14 mmHg were associated with successful entry and those greater than 20 mmHg with abdominal wall insufflation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of laparoscopic surgery and their management are discussed in detail separately.

Over 50 percent of these complications occurred at entry, and 20 to 25 percent of complications were not recognized until the postoperative period.</p><p>Risk factors for complications include prior surgery or intraabdominal disease (endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease), bowel distension, bladder distension and large <span class=\"nowrap\">pelvic/abdominal</span> masses, among others.

(See <a href=\"#H467390\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopy versus laparotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation prior to laparoscopy includes a review of medical comorbidities, appropriate preoperative testing, assessment for risk factors for adhesive disease and other conditions that may alter the anatomy of the abdominal wall and peritoneal cavity (eg, umbilical hernia, appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard patient positions for gynecologic laparoscopy are supine or dorsal lithotomy. If the dorsal lithotomy position is used, the patient's legs are placed in stirrups.

Instruments that are particular to laparoscopy include the telescope (camera), instruments for laparoscopic entry, the uterine cannula to manipulate the uterus, and bags and morcellators used for tissue removal. (See <a href=\"#H121809411\" class=\"local\">'Instrumentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecologic laparoscopic access is commonly through the umbilicus, frequently using a Veress needle for insufflation followed by trocar placement. The use of optical trocars, radially expanding trocars, or open techniques are alternative methods of entry. Approximately half of laparoscopic complications are related to initial entry into the peritoneal cavity. There are no data that one entry approach is better than another for reducing the risk of injury upon entry.

Non-abdominal sites include the posterior vaginal fornix, through the uterus. Palmer's point and the posterior uterine cul-de-sac can be used for both insufflation and trocar insertion.
