Overall, VIT reduces the chance of having a serious allergic reaction to an insect sting by 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Stated differently, more than 95 percent of patients allergic to vespid (ie, yellow jacket, hornet, and wasp) venom and 80 to 90 percent of those allergic to honey bee venom will not develop any systemic allergic symptoms if re-stung while receiving VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. The rest usually experience only mild symptoms. VIT has also been demonstrated to significantly improve health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the studies that have addressed this question and discuss the risk factors for recurrent SARs to Hymenoptera stings after the discontinuation of VIT. The efficacy, indications, and other issues concerning VIT are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of a recurrent systemic allergic reaction (SAR) to a sting after stopping VIT decreases the longer VIT has been administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After three to five years of VIT, most patients who stop VIT will remain protected from recurrent SARs, and this is the suggested minimum duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This recommendation is based upon the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>One year of treatment</strong> &ndash; An early retrospective study evaluated recurrent SARs to stings in 82 patients who chose to stop VIT after varying amounts of time, with a mean duration of treatment of 14 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Over the ensuing three to four years, 22 percent of those who were re-stung had SARs, compared with 1 to 3 percent of patients who remained on VIT. Thus, one year of VIT did not provide sufficient protection for nearly one-quarter of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>At least three years of treatment</strong> &ndash; Several prospective studies evaluated the protection afforded by VIT if it was given for at least three years and then stopped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72537 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. Of note, most of the patients in these early studies were selected because they showed evidence of a reduction in sensitivity to venom in response to VIT, either through skin tests or serum tests or because they had done well with a subsequent sting, so their prognosis may have been better as a group. After three years of VIT, 83 to 100 percent of patients remained protected against recurrent SARs in the first one to three years after stopping. Most or all of the patients who did develop SARs with repeat stings after stopping VIT had only mild symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>At least five years of treatment</strong> &ndash; Studies of &ge;5 years of treatment show slightly higher rates of protection, even in unselected groups of patients. In one study, the percentage of patients who developed SARs after stopping VIT was significantly lower (5 percent) among patients who had received VIT for &ge;50 months, compared with 18 percent among those who received treatment for 33 to 49 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another study evaluated 74 patients treated with VIT for at least five years who volunteered to stop treatment and undergo periodic testing and sting challenges every one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Over the ensuing two to five years, systemic symptoms occurred in 7 of 74 patients (10 percent) or in 8 of 270 challenges (3 percent), and just two reactions required <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection. In a second study of 29 adults with vespid venom allergy, there were no recurrent SARs upon challenge one year after stopping treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of imported fire ant immunotherapy is less well-defined and discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Thus, three years of VIT protects the majority of patients, although the studies showing this disproportionately included patients with good prognoses. Extending treatment to five years protects the majority of unselected patients. Selected patients may require indefinite therapy.

Other characteristics, such as sex or the presence of atopic disorders, do not influence the risk of a relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Older age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children have a lower risk for recurrent SARs than adults after discontinuing VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a representative study, SARs were reported in 8.3 percent of children, compared with 13.1 percent of adults who were stung within seven years after stopping VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another study reported that only 5 percent of children (with initial moderate-to-severe reactions) experienced recurrent SARs when evaluated more than 10 years after stopping VIT, compared with a rate of 16 percent in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe pretreatment reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe initial sting reactions are at higher risk for a recurrent SAR both during and after completion of VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Combining the data from four prospective studies involving 386 patients, relapses were observed in 4 percent of those with mild initial reactions, compared with 14 percent of those with severe pretreatment reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51249 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15,22,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22,27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bee venom allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bee venom allergy are at higher risk for recurrent SARs than those allergic to vespid venoms, both before and after VIT. Before treatment, 51 percent of bee-allergic patients develop recurrent SARs upon sting challenge, compared with 25 percent of those allergic to vespid venoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>During and after VIT, patients allergic to bee venom remain at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. In one study of VIT of three to five or more years duration, the relapse rate in 120 patients allergic to bee venom was 16 percent, compared with 8 percent in 80 patients allergic to vespid venoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The reasons for this difference are not entirely clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The venom content of a honey bee sting is much higher than that of a vespid sting. It is also possible that vespid stings are more variable in venom content than bee stings, because vespids retain their stingers after stinging, and thus, insects can sting more than once, while honey bees lose their sting apparatus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stinging-insects-biology-and-identification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stinging insects: Biology and identification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with concomitant cardiovascular disease are at increased risk for severe SARs to Hymenoptera stings and poor outcomes resulting from stings, including myocardial and cerebrovascular infarction or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This is probably also true for patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, although it is less well-documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3388194\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of cardiovascular medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear how the use of cardiovascular medicines impacts the risk of a recurrent SAR or poor outcome. Given the suspected risk associated with these medications before and possibly during VIT, it is prudent to consider all the relative risks when making decisions about discontinuing VIT. Studies examining the safety of these medications during VIT are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action#H2636908155\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Patients requiring ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactions to injections or stings during VIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of patients undergoing VIT will have an allergic reaction to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients who develop general allergic reactions to VIT injections or to repeat stings during VIT are at higher risk for reactions to stings after VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. In one study, those who had SARs to injections during treatment had a 38 percent chance of relapse, compared with a 7 percent chance among those who tolerated injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Patients who have recurrent SARs during maintenance VIT should be evaluated for mast cell disorders with a baseline serum tryptase level. In addition, a higher maintenance dose of venom is recommended to achieve protection in such individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These issues are discussed separately.

However, others have not been able to confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].

Conversely, a significant percentage of patients with severe shock reactions following Hymenoptera stings have evidence of a mast cell disorder. Up to one-third of patients with severe anaphylactic reactions from stings demonstrate an elevated baseline serum tryptase level (ie, &gt;11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> whereas an elevated serum tryptase level is observed in less than 5 percent of an unselected adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>Patients with mast cell disorders, including an elevated baseline serum tryptase and venom allergy, can be successfully treated with VIT, and they appear to be at high risk for recurrent SARs if treatment is discontinued. Two female patients with urticaria pigmentosa and vespid allergy died from stings sustained three and nine years after stopping VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Based on such reports, it has been recommended that patients with mastocytosis and Hymenoptera venom allergy receive lifelong VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These patients must also understand that they remain at elevated risk despite treatment and must carry at least one <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector at all times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The management of venom allergy in patients with systemic mastocytosis is reviewed elsewhere.

Those who experience SARs generally (but not always) have mild symptoms. Protection up to seven years after discontinuing VIT was analyzed in four studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15,22,25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22,25,27,28</a>]. These studies reported complete protection in 80 to 91 percent of patients, a slightly lower percentage than in studies of the first three years off therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeated stings after stopping VIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are stung repeatedly after stopping VIT have a greater risk of eventually having a recurrent SAR compared with those who are stung infrequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. The severity of SARs tends to increase in response to repeated stings in patients who have discontinued VIT. In one study of 200 patients treated with at least three years of VIT, 25 patients were re-stung, and 84 percent of them experienced no reaction or only a mild SAR to the initial post-treatment sting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76805 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Another study reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Therefore, patients should continue their efforts to avoid being stung after stopping VIT.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>The decision to stop VIT can be relatively complex, and experts may approach it differently. The allergy specialist should consider the patient's sensitivity according to repeat diagnostic testing, together with other individual risk factors, including relevant comorbid conditions and vocational and recreational activities. The patient's comfort with risk and other preferences must also be factored into the decision. No two situations are identical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960599329\"><span class=\"h2\">Background</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the introduction of VIT in the 1970s, it was initially believed that therapy would need to be continued indefinitely in most patients. However, reports began to appear describing relatively good outcomes in patients who chose to stop their venom injections for various reasons. In addition, a subset of patients on VIT appeared to lose sensitivity (ie, skin tests to venom converted to negative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum levels of venom-specific immunoglobulin E [IgE] antibodies fell to low levels). Finally, the cost and inconvenience of lifelong injections are not insignificant. For these reasons, a number of studies were initiated from the mid-1980s to try to determine if and when VIT could be safely stopped. Similarly, studies have looked at expanding the dosing intervals from the conventional of every four to six weeks to every three to four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and even longer. Some patients may wish to extend the dosing interval, rather than stop VIT altogether. Dosing intervals are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

It is our practice to repeat testing only in those patients in whom we are considering stopping VIT after three to five years. In this setting, we usually perform skin testing and measure venom-specific IgE antibodies to assess how these parameters have changed compared with the pretreatment results.</p><p>The decision to stop VIT is sometimes straightforward. For example, most allergists would readily discontinue treatment in the individual with a history of moderate SARs to stings in whom both skin tests and venom-specific IgE have become negative after three years of VIT. However, if the same patient had a persistently high level of serum-specific IgE after five years of VIT and was a farmer or gardener, the decision becomes far more difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The allergy specialist should ensure that patients who discontinue VIT understand the following about their risk for a recurrent systemic allergic reaction (SAR):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of a recurrent serious reaction does not fall to zero, and it may be as high as 10 percent per sting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the residual risk, the patient should continue to carry an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector and take measures to avoid Hymenoptera.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is possible to react to one sting and not another, so an uneventful sting does not mean the patient is &quot;cured&quot; of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any serious SARs should be reported to the allergy specialist so that the patient's situation can be re-evaluated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3281206287\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
