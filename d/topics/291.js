The most common cause is structural (ie, disc herniation or degenerative spinal stenosis) leading to root compression.</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathy, focusing on the acute period (up to four weeks). Other clinical aspects of lumbosacral radiculopathy and the management of lumbar spinal stenosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of subacute and chronic low back pain is reviewed elsewhere.

Though rare, cauda equina syndrome represents a true surgical emergency where decompression should be performed within 24 hours, and within 12 hours if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With radiculopathy caused by disc herniation or foraminal stenosis, symptomatic treatment is used during the acute period. However, mechanism-specific treatment is indicated if there is progressive neurologic compromise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent symptoms that are unresponsive to time and conservative measures. </p><p/><p>It can be helpful to group patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy into one of three general categories based upon radicular symptoms and signs. These are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain without a motor deficit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain with a mild motor deficit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain with a marked motor deficit (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Severity'</a>)</p><p/><p>Since lumbosacral radiculopathy due to disc herniation is typically self-limited, symptomatic treatment is used to tide the patient over the acute period. In patients who have underlying lumbar spinal stenosis due to degenerative arthritis, the radicular symptoms can wax and wane, although the long-term prognosis may be less favorable than a disc herniation.</p><p>In order to reduce the risk of recurrent symptoms, a program of weight reduction should be encouraged in patients with elevated body mass index.</p><p>Surgery for disc herniation and lumbar spinal stenosis is most commonly performed because of persistent symptoms or progressive neurological impairment. In the setting of progressive neurological impairment, rapid surgical consultation should be considered.</p><p>The diagnosis and evaluation of suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbosacral radiculopathy is often extremely painful. Analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and activity modification are the mainstay of treatment. Physical therapy is often tried for patients with mild to moderate persistent symptoms, but evidence of effectiveness is lacking.</p><p>The use of opioids and muscle relaxants to treat acute, severe low back pain is common in clinical practice. Opioids are most often prescribed for patients with radiculopathy and severe pain who have inadequate relief with non-narcotics. However, opioids should be limited to short-term use only.</p><p>Both benzodiazepines and antispasmodic agents (classified as muscle relaxants) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a> are commonly used in painful radiculopathy. However, their efficacy has not been demonstrated, and they would be expected to have little benefit for pain arising from the compressed nerve root. In our clinical experience, muscle relaxants do not provide a significant benefit over nonnarcotic analgesic medications. Using opioids combined with muscle relaxants is risky because of the additive sedating effects.</p><p>The utility of systemic glucocorticoids and epidural glucocorticoids is limited, as discussed below.</p><p>Unfortunately, interpretation of the available treatment data is confounded by several issues, which include the benign or self-limited course of lumbosacral radiculopathy, the role of placebo effect, and social factors. These issues impede the selection of effective treatments, particularly for patients who fail to gain complete relief despite a four week course of analgesic medication, activity modification, and physical treatments. It is not known whether four additional weeks of the same conservative treatments would be as beneficial as potential alternatives, such as systemic and epidural glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonnarcotic analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical experience suggests that short-term treatment with either a NSAID or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is useful for patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. NSAIDs may be preferred for patients without significant renal, gastric, or cardiovascular comorbidity, while acetaminophen can be used for patients without hepatic compromise who cannot tolerate NSAIDs.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy has not been established.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized trial of 300 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute pain in the sciatic nerve distribution found that intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> was more effective than placebo but less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> for reducing pain intensity at 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2012 meta-analysis identified three trials comparing NSAIDs with placebo for acute sciatica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pooled analysis showed only a small and statistically nonsignificant treatment effect for improvement in pain. The quality of evidence for this analysis was considered low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 meta-analysis included 10 randomized controlled trials with over 1600 participants that evaluated NSAIDs versus placebo or other medications for sciatica; seven of the trials enrolled only patients with acute sciatica of &lt;3 weeks duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There was no significant effect of NSAIDs for pain reduction, but NSAIDs led to a better global improvement compared with placebo. The quality of the evidence in this analysis was also low.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activity modification is as important as analgesics treatment in the management of acute radiculopathy. The goals are to lessen nerve root impingement and to avoid activities that exacerbate pain.</p><p>Patients often identify pain-relieving positions for themselves. Some individuals report that semisitting, reclining, or lying in certain positions in bed provide meaningful pain relief. Others find that recumbency in bed is associated with increased pain. Such patients may prefer to be up and around, even going about light work duties.</p><p>Modification or avoidance of activity does not imply prolonged complete bed rest. When the acute symptoms decrease, we recommend resuming modest physical activity as tolerated. Randomized trials of patients with acute lumbosacral radicular syndromes have found no significant difference in outcome for treatment with bed rest versus watchful waiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or bed rest versus physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, a systematic review of these studies found no benefit for bed rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical or manual therapies are often tried for patients with persistent symptoms that are mild or moderate in nature. However, few studies have evaluated physical or manual therapies for acute radiculopathy, and there is no convincing evidence that such treatments are effective for this indication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain#H3556868719\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal timing of referral to physical therapy remains unclear, as does the optimal frequency of visits and duration of therapy. In general, physical therapy in the first one to two weeks is not recommended because patients with mild symptoms are likely to improve on their own while patients with very severe symptoms cannot participate in exercise therapy. Given the generally favorable natural history of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy, it is reasonable to delay physical therapy until symptoms have persisted for three weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid therapy is commonly considered for patients with severe pain that is inadequately controlled with NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. However, no high-quality trials have evaluated opioids specifically for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. Similarly, there are no data to suggest that chronic opioid use is of value for radiculopathy.</p><p>Adverse effects of opiates include sedation, confusion, nausea, and constipation. Respiratory depression is an issue at higher doses but rarely at the doses used for acute low back pain. As with other medications, older patients are more susceptible to these adverse effects.</p><p>In the absence of definitive data, use of opiates for low back pain is a matter of clinical judgment. Some experts oppose the use of opiates for acute radiculopathy given the lack of proven efficacy, the potential for serious side effects, and the potential for misuse and abuse. Other experts advise measures to reduce the risk of dependency and addiction when using opiates, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using short-acting opioid analgesics for the treatment of acute pain only when the severity of the pain is reasonably assumed to warrant their use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starting with the lowest possible effective dose </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing no more than a short course of opioid analgesics for acute pain or no more than three days (some would allow for up to two weeks)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding initial treatment with long-acting or extended-release opioid analgesics</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the clinical experience of some of the authors, systemic glucocorticoid treatment may provide partial pain relief for select patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. However, the available evidence suggests that systemic glucocorticoid therapy has either limited benefit or no benefit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2017 systematic review and practice guideline from the American College of Physicians evaluated six randomized trials of moderate quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>] and concluded that systemic glucocorticoids have no benefit for pain, and no to small benefit for function, in patients with radicular low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the larger randomized controlled trials included in the systematic review cited above, 269 patients who had radicular pain for three months or less were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (five days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg per day) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At 3 and 52 weeks, the improvement in disability scores was modestly greater for the prednisone group, a result that was statistically significant but of marginal clinical importance. There was no significant difference between the groups in pain scores during follow-up, and no difference in the rate of lumbar spine surgery at 52 weeks.</p><p/><p>Acknowledging that any benefit is likely modest, one author of this topic sometimes employs a course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (60 to 80 mg daily) for five to seven days for patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy who do not respond well to analgesics and activity modification. This is followed by a rapid taper to discontinuation over the following 7 to 14 days. However, the other authors generally do not use systemic glucocorticoids in this setting.</p><p>Major side effects associated with systemic glucocorticoids include elevated blood pressure, mood disorders, psychosis, insomnia, gastritis, ulcer formation, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, bone loss, and heightened risk of typical infections. Some of these side effects are both dose and duration dependent, and are more likely to occur with long-term glucocorticoid use.</p><p>Patients taking glucocorticoids in combination with NSAIDs may require prophylaxis against gastrointestinal bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidural glucocorticoid injections may provide modest transient benefit for amelioration of back and leg pain in patients with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. However, they provide no benefit beyond three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Given the usually self-limited natural history of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy and the availability of alternatives, epidural glucocorticoid injections are not recommended during the acute phase of lumbosacral radiculopathy. After weighing risks and benefits, their use may be reasonable for selected patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy who have not improved with conservative treatment over six weeks. The risks and benefits of this approach are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonsurgical-interventional-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonsurgical interventional treatment&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid and other injections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is to relieve symptoms due to compression or inflammation of affected nerve roots. The surgery involves either partial or complete removal of the herniated disc. The utility of surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc prolapse is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Lumbar disc prolapse'</a>.)</p><p>The decision to have surgery requires assessing whether a clinically meaningful reduction in pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disability is more likely to occur spontaneously or with surgery. The patient's course with regard to pain and neurologic deficits (for better or worse) over time will help inform the final decision.</p><p>There is no evidence that early referral for surgery improves outcome in patients with lumbar disc prolapse and radiculopathy who do not have severe or progressive neurologic deficits. Most studies comparing surgery and nonsurgical care have included patients with at least six weeks of symptoms. In these studies, patients who undergo discectomy have a more favorable outcome than nonsurgically treated patients at short-term follow-up, but outcomes are equivalent at one to two years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Standard open discectomy or microdiscectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Current guidelines from the American Pain Society recommend that clinicians discuss risks and benefits of surgery with patients who have persistent, disabling radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The guidelines note that benefits are moderate on average, and decrease over time compared with patients who do not choose to have surgery.</p><p>There is no clear correlation between the size of disc herniation or nerve compression and the amount of spinal nerve root injury. Small compressive lesions can at times produce severe, irreversible nerve damage if they affect arterial blood supply to the nerve. An ischemic nerve lesion, though severe, would not be likely to improve after removal of the compressive lesion.</p><p>For patients with persistent (at least six weeks duration), disabling lumbar radicular symptoms who are good surgical candidates and desire surgery, either open discectomy or microdiscectomy are reasonable options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Lumbar disc prolapse'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93636885\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While acute lumbosacral radiculopathy is often extremely painful, the likelihood of spontaneous improvement is thought to be high when the cause is disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis due to degenerative arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
