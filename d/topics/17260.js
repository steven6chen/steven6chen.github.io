The general approach to tibial fractures, care of proximal tibial fractures in children, and stress fractures of the tibia and fibula are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal tibial fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial shaft fractures are the third most common fractures in children, after fractures of the femur and forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mechanism varies depending on the age of the patient, with low energy falls and twisting injuries being more common in younger children and high energy motor vehicle accidents and sports-related injuries predominating in older children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72158\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72158 \">image 1</a>). The high-energy transmitted to the soft tissues surrounding the bone is relevant because of the significant risk for compartment syndrome associated with tibial shaft fractures. Thus, special attention should be paid to neurovascular status in the first 24 hours following such injuries. Open fractures, most commonly caused by vehicular related injury, are also a major concern with tibial shaft fractures because the anterior tibia is very close to the skin surface.</p><p>Most tibial shaft fractures are short oblique or transverse fractures of the middle or distal third of the shaft. Tibial shaft fractures are associated with fibula fractures in 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The average age at injury is eight years, and it is more common in boys than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tibia is the major weightbearing bone of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint. The distal end of the bone forms the superior articular surface of the ankle joint at the tibiotalar articulation and the medial malleolus. The tibial shaft bridges the proximal and distal ends and its anterior surface lies just below the skin.</p><p>In children, both the tibia and fibula consist of a long portion of bone (the diaphysis) with growth plates at either end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 1</a>). The distal physes, particularly of the fibula, are areas vulnerable to fracture when subjected to inversion and eversion stresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-fractures-in-children#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Distal fibula fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Pediatric bones have a lower cortical mineral content than adult bones, allowing children's long bones a greater degree of plasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, torus fractures and bowing deformities are injuries unique to the pediatric bone. While these injuries occur most commonly in the forearm, they are also seen in the tibia and fibula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Buckle (torus)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Plastic deformation'</a>.)</p><p>A strong fibrous structure, the interosseous membrane, connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation. Distally, the interosseous membrane and three ligaments (the anterior, posterior, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments) stabilize the superior ankle joint.</p><p>Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579 \">figure 2</a>). Three of these (the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments) all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.</p><p>Nerves and vessels lie within the anterior, lateral, and the deep posterior compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579 \">figure 2</a>). Trauma that causes significant swelling in these compartments can result in neurovascular compromise. The key blood supply of the tibia arises from periosteal vessels and the nutrient artery. The nutrient artery originates from the posterior tibial artery and enters the posterolateral cortex at the middle third of the tibial shaft near the origin of the soleus muscle. Fractures in this region have the potential to compromise this blood supply.</p><p>Other aspects of tibial anatomy are described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variation in deforming force and in patient susceptibility lead to different fracture patterns in the lower leg:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spiral (toddler's) and oblique fractures</strong> &ndash; Most of these injuries occur in children under 11 years of age when the child's body rotates around a fixed foot. In older children, the force is often substantial (eg, skiing, contact sports) and may involve the tibia and fibula. However, in toddlers this injury often results from relatively minor trauma of which the caregiver may be unaware or may dismiss as trivial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67469\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67469 \">image 2</a>). Typically, the tibia is the only affected bone. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In differentiating unintentional from abusive trauma in toddlers with spiral fractures, the clinician should understand that 90 to 95 percent of unintentional toddler's fractures of the tibia have a reported mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In these instances, the described force is typically mild, and the fracture is minimally displaced. For example, the toddler may stumble and catch the foot between the bars of a crib, or may slip on toys on the floor while running. Like all long-bone fractures, spiral fractures are suspicious (but not pathognomonic) for abuse when the patient is too young to walk or lacks a consistent history (ie, of having had a twisting or rotational injury). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic aspects of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Location and type of fracture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transverse fractures</strong> &ndash; These fractures result from a direct blow to the lower leg that is perpendicular to the bone shaft and indicates a high degree of force (eg, motor vehicle collision) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72158\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72158 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transverse fractures of the femur, humerus, or tibia are the most common type of long-bone fracture associated with abuse, comprising 48 to 71 percent of abuse-related fractures in various studies. Thus, child abuse should be suspected when the reported mechanism does not correlate with the degree of injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic aspects of child abuse&quot;, section on 'Location and type of fracture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bowing fractures </strong>&ndash; Plastic bowing fractures are caused by axial loading that creates microfractures along the cortex and abnormal curvature of the bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These fractures are more common in the radius and ulna, but may also be seen in the fibula. The abnormality may be subtle, requiring comparison views to detect on plain radiographs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Plastic deformation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Torus (buckle) fractures</strong> &ndash; Torus fractures (also known as buckle fractures) are caused by compressive forces that lead to buckling of the cortex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-fracture-patterns-and-description-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children&quot;, section on 'Buckle (torus)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibular fractures</strong> &ndash; Approximately 30 percent of tibial fractures have an associated fibular fracture. Isolated fibular fractures indicate a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the lower leg.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of children with suspected tibial fractures is described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p>Children with tibial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibular shaft fractures may have pain, swelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity at the site of injury. Most patients are unable or unwilling to walk, with the exception of those children with an isolated fibular fracture.</p><p>Additional findings of specific fractures are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oblique or transverse fractures</strong> &ndash; These fractures are more likely to be open and are also at higher risk for compartment syndrome because of the high-energy mechanisms involved. Thus, careful examination for a puncture wound or laceration overlying the fracture and assessment of distal neurovascular status should occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Acute compartment syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toddler's fractures</strong> &ndash; Eliciting localized pain over the site of injury may be difficult, particularly in a child who is already crying. There is usually no swelling or deformity of the distal tibia to guide the clinician to the site of injury. For classic toddler's fractures, placing the hands at the knee and ankle and gently twisting in opposite directions should elicit pain, as may gently grinding the heel of the foot into the distal tibia. The full range of motion at the hips, knees, and ankles is preserved and should be documented.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bowing or torus (buckle) fractures</strong> &ndash; Often, there is no swelling or minimal swelling at the fracture site. Patients with a torus fracture typically have identifiable bony point tenderness. Plastic deformation is visible only with significant angulation of the fracture although comparison with the unaffected side may allow detection of subtle differences.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral plain radiographic views of the lower leg, including the knee and ankle, constitute the initial imaging of choice in the child with a suspected tibial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibular shaft fracture.</p><p>Based on the radiographic findings, tibial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibular shaft fractures are classified by diaphyseal location (proximal, middle, or distal third), configuration (transverse, oblique, spiral), angulation, amount of displacement, degree of comminution, and degree of shortening.</p><p>Additional radiographic features by type of injury are listed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toddler's fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toddler's fractures are a specialized case of spiral fractures of the distal tibia. The toddler's fracture is a nondisplaced fracture of the distal tibial shaft in patients in the age group from 9 months to 3 years, when weightbearing is just beginning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The definition of toddler's fractures can be expanded to include fractures of other lower extremity bones including fractures of the foot, but the tibia is the most commonly affected bone because it bears most of the weight of the lower leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>AP and lateral radiographs of the affected leg may show a faint hairline fracture that can be easily missed, mistaken for a nutrient vessel, or inapparent on initial films in almost a third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The AP view is the best view for observing the nondisplaced spiral fracture coursing along the distal tibia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67469\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67469 \">image 2</a>). Oblique views of the tibia can aid diagnosis when the AP and lateral plain radiographs are not revealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of a toddler&rsquo;s fracture but negative plain radiographs, repeat plain radiographs in seven days will show evidence of new bone growth. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Spiral (toddler's) fractures'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Occasionally, a child is brought to medical attention in a delayed fashion because of mild clinical symptoms and an unclear history. Seven to ten days after injury, there may be healing and periosteal reaction on radiographs which may look concerning for osteomyelitis or a bone tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51722\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51722 \">image 3</a>). In this circumstance, advanced imaging is warranted, either gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if infection is the primary concern or computed tomography (CT) if significant bone destruction is seen on plain film [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

It may be useful when MRI is not available, the area of infection cannot be localized, or multiple areas of involvement are suspected, especially in patients with atypical presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The only clinical manifestation of fracture in such cases may be erythema overlying the anterior tibia, which can be confused with cellulitis.
