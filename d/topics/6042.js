These implants are predominately found in the pelvis but may be present anywhere in the body. This ectopic endometrium can cause scarring, infertility, and pain. The surgical management of pelvic pain due to endometriosis is reviewed here.

Therefore, treatment decisions are individualized and consider clinical presentation (eg, pain, infertility, mass), symptom severity, disease extent and location, reproductive desires, patient age, medication side effects, surgical complication rates, and cost. Therapies for endometriosis-related pelvic pain include analgesics, hormonal treatments, and surgical intervention, and a combined approach is often used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to any treatment, all women should have a thorough history and examination, and other causes of pelvic pain should be excluded.

Women who are close to menopause may prefer to tolerate suboptimally controlled symptoms in order to avoid surgery. Menopause can be anticipated in a woman who is approaching the average age of menopause (51 years) or has symptoms of the menopausal transition. Whether or not to proceed with surgery in these women depends upon each woman's assessment of her quality of life compared with the benefits of avoiding surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11363599\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative planning involves assessing the patient's desired surgical outcome and counseling the patient regarding the extent and approach of the planned surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13645162\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative versus definitive surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative surgery involves excision or ablation of endometriotic lesions with the intent of preserving the uterus and as much ovarian tissue as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conservative surgery is the first-line option for most women planning surgical treatment of endometriosis because it preserves fertility and hormone production, is less invasive and morbid than definitive surgery, and has documented short-term efficacy. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 trials on laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis reported that conservative laparoscopic surgery reduced overall pain (73 versus 21 percent) and increased live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates (30 versus 18 percent) compared with diagnostic laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pain reduction was similar for laparoscopic excision compared with laparoscopic ablation, but the data were limited.</p><p>The disadvantage of conservative surgery is that the rate of recurrent symptoms is higher compared with definitive surgery (hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy). The rate of reoperation appears to increase over time for conservative surgery, whereas it remains relatively stable for definitive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of 240 women who underwent either laparoscopic resection or hysterectomy for endometriosis-related symptoms, repeat surgery was more common in women who underwent resection over seven years of follow-up (58 versus 19 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Both surgical groups retained their ovaries. The lowest reoperation rate, 8 percent, was in the subgroup of women who underwent hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. In a larger retrospective study of over 50,000 patients who underwent initial laparoscopic resection or hysterectomy, the reoperation rates at 8 years of follow-up were 35 and 5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Definitive surgery includes hysterectomy, with or without oophorectomy. Definitive surgery is offered to women with debilitating symptoms that are likely from endometriosis, have completed childbearing, and have failed other treatment options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The main disadvantages of definitive surgery are the surgical risks, loss of fertility, and symptoms of surgical menopause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255386695\"><span class=\"h3\">Hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We reserve hysterectomy for women with persistent bothersome symptoms of endometriosis who do not plan future childbearing and who have failed both medical therapy and at least one conservative treatment procedure. Definitive surgery is also reasonable for women who have additional indications for hysterectomy (eg, symptomatic fibroids or prolapse). Hysterectomy alone is an effective treatment for pain symptoms of endometriosis, with a reoperation rate of 19 percent in one study, compared with a 58 percent reoperation rate for women undergoing conservative surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90102 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The main benefit of hysterectomy is a lower long-term reoperation rate for endometriosis-related symptoms compared with conservative surgery, as discussed above.</p><p>Disadvantages of hysterectomy include loss of reproductive ability, higher surgical complication rates, negative impact on body image, and earlier loss of ovarian function. In general, hysterectomy is associated with higher surgical complication rates compared with laparoscopic surgery. Prospective studies of over 37,000 hysterectomies reported an overall complication rate of 3.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] compared with a 0.2 percent laparoscopic complication rate as reported by a retrospective series of 1894 laparoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, some women who undergo hysterectomy experience regret for loss of fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, a study of 311 women younger than 45 years of age who had a hysterectomy for various indications reported that up to 43 percent felt regret about the loss of fertility despite a surgical satisfaction rate of greater than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H244676280\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Non-surgical outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>We counsel women that hysterectomy without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and conservative surgery are not equivalent in terms of preservation of hormonal function. Women who undergo hysterectomy with conservation of ovaries are likely to experience menopause one to four years earlier than women who retain their uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-24</a>]. Hysterectomy alone (ie, without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) is performed for women who desire pain control and preservation of ovarian hormonal function. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255386701\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of oophorectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who benefit from oophorectomy include those with extensive adnexal disease and those for whom the risks of reoperation outweigh the risks of premature menopause. Oophorectomy likely increases the efficacy of definitive surgery but is also accompanied by the quality-of-life issues and potential adverse health effects of premature menopause. There are no data that establish an age-based cut-off for oophorectomy. In our practice, we counsel all women undergoing definitive surgery about the risks and benefits of oophorectomy, and we tend to discourage oophorectomy in women younger than 40 years.</p><p>The rationale for ovary removal is that endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease. Removal of both ovaries creates a postmenopausal state and theoretically reduces pelvic pain caused by endometriosis. These women are counseled that surgical menopause will result from bilateral oophorectomy, and these symptoms must be balanced against the pain symptoms from endometriosis. Treatment for vasomotor symptoms of surgical menopause is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H29195243\" class=\"local\">'Hormone therapy for menopause symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>For treatment of pain, removal of the ovaries appears to be more effective than ovarian conservation in reducing endometriosis-related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>], but this finding has not been universally reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One reason for conflicting results is that the reoperation rate changes over time, with more repeat surgeries occurring over longer duration of follow-up. In the retrospective cohort study discussed above, the reoperation rates were 58 percent for women who underwent laparoscopic surgery with ovarian conservation, 19 percent for women who underwent hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, and 8 percent for women who underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90102\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90102 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For women who had a hysterectomy and underwent reoperation, the repeat surgeries consisted of removal of ovaries or ovarian remnants and <span class=\"nowrap\">excision/ablation</span> of endometriotic lesions.</p><p>Disadvantages of bilateral oophorectomy include premature menopause, menopausal symptoms, and the potential for long-term deleterious health effects. Early menopause, defined as menopause in women age 44 or younger, increases the risks of overall mortality, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, osteoporosis, and psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. It is uncertain whether these effects are ameliorated by hormone therapy (see <a href=\"#H29195243\" class=\"local\">'Hormone therapy for menopause symptoms'</a> below). The effects of oophorectomy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment with oophorectomy alone without hysterectomy has not been well studied and is not common practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Since oophorectomy results in the loss of both hormonal and reproductive function, there is little advantage to retaining the uterus unless the patient desires to become pregnant by an assisted reproductive technology procedure, such as using her own frozen oocytes, embryos, or donor oocytes. It is unclear whether hysterectomy affects future risk of pelvic organ prolapse when performed for the indication of endometriosis-related pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylactic-vaginal-apex-suspension-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy#H14752758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylactic vaginal apex suspension at the time of hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Impact of hysterectomy on future prolapse risk'</a>.)</p><p>Even for women who have undergone an oophorectomy, there may be retained ovarian tissue that contributes to recurrent pelvic pain. When multiple conservative procedures have been performed over time, it may be difficult to successfully perform a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy because some of the ovarian tissue has become loculated in the retroperitoneum and is difficult to find and remove. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Ovarian remnant syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13645554\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy versus laparotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy and laparotomy are equally effective in treating endometriosis-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Laparoscopic surgery is generally preferred to laparotomy because it is associated with improved surgical visualization (from lens magnification), less pain, shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery, and better cosmetic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/2,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31,32</a>]. Laparoscopy is performed for the great majority of procedures for treatment of endometriosis, regardless of the severity of disease. The choice of surgical approach for hysterectomy is made based upon the same factors as used for other gynecologic indications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H801890408\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Selecting the route of hysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Long-term outcomes following conventional or robot-assisted laparoscopic surgeries for the treatment of endometriosis-related symptoms have not been compared in high-quality studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a small multicenter clinical trial comparing operative time and perioperative complications between laparoscopic and robot-assisted resection of endometriosis, there were no differences in mean operative time, intra- or post-operative complication rates, or rates of conversion to laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, both groups reported similar improvements in quality of life outcomes at six weeks and six months. Somewhat older studies have reported that robotic surgery generally takes longer, which could reflect disparate groups, larger study sample sizes, or decreased familiarity with the technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. It is hypothesized that in patients with lesions in complex anatomic sites (eg, retrocervical lesions), a robot-assisted approach may provide improved instrument articulation compared with conventional laparoscopy, but no data are available. </p><p>Laparotomy may be necessary when dealing with extensive adhesions or invasive endometriosis located near structures such as the uterine arteries, ureter, bladder, and bowel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29195061\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preoperative evaluation includes studies pertinent to the patient's symptoms (eg, pelvic ultrasound for pelvic pain) in addition to routine preoperative evaluation for gynecologic surgery.

DIE refers to lesions that penetrate to a depth of 5 mm or more. These lesions are frequently multifocal and may involve the uterosacral ligaments, retrocervical space, bowel, ureteral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A nodule infiltrating the rectosigmoid colon can appear as a single &quot;moose antler&quot; on pelvic ultrasound or the so-called &quot;moose antler sign&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Complete resection requires appropriate surgical expertise that often includes a multidisciplinary surgical team (general surgeon, urologist).</p><p>If DIE is suspected based on symptomatology (eg, dysuria, dyschezia, hematochezia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination (eg, uterosacral ligament tenderness with dense nodules, nonmobile uterus), the preoperative evaluation includes testing targeted to the specific symptom. Examples include cystoscopy for evaluation or urinary symptoms or colonoscopy for evaluation of hematochezia. Extensive pelvic adhesions are difficult to diagnose with imaging. However, magnetic resonance imaging or rectal sonography may suggest an obliterated pelvic cul-de-sac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

As the differences in the more common symptoms of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia were non-significant, the choice of modality is based upon surgeon experience and preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. When selecting an ablative technology, the surgeon compares the depth, width, and spread of tissue damage, as they vary based on the instrument and energy utilized. Laser and electrosurgery techniques are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-medical-lasers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of medical lasers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Devices for hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we excise at least one lesion to obtain tissue for histologic confirmation of endometriosis. It is important to appreciate the anatomy beneath the lesion and that fibrosis causes retraction, which may distort the lesion's relationship to nearby structures (eg, ureter, blood vessels). The incision is made superficially in the normal peritoneum and then the lesion is dissected off of surrounding structures. Hydrodissection can aid this separation if the disease does not have a deep component. Wide excision is useful, as nonvisualized disease has been reported up to 27 mm from the lesion in normal-appearing peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>We palpate the lesion with a laparoscopic grasper to determine its degree of nodularity and depth of penetration. If the decision is made to proceed with surgical treatment, we prefer excision to ablation for lesions near vital structures (eg, ureters, blood vessels) because diffusion of the ablative energy may injure these tissues as well. Excision must be done with extreme care to avoid perforation into nearby structures. Lesions adjacent to vital structures cannot always be safely treated surgically, and postoperative medical therapy is used instead. Resection of urinary tract or retrocervical endometriosis is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-of-the-bladder-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis of the bladder and ureter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rectovaginal-or-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rectovaginal or bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radical resection of endometriosis refers to removal of all visible implants at the time of surgery. In a questionnaire study of nearly 100 women with endometriosis who underwent radical resection, the women reported significant decreases in pain scores, frequency of interrupted sexual intercourse, feelings of guilt towards the partner, being afraid of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">before/during</span> sexual intercourse, and feelings of being a burden for the relationship at an average of 10 months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189557\"><span class=\"h2\">Adhesiolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with endometriosis often develop intraperitoneal adhesive disease; adhesions are reported in up to 70 percent of women (both with and without prior surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Red lesions are associated with more adhesions than black, white, and clear lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Since adhesions often reform as part of the postoperative healing, and may reform in a way that exacerbates pain or infertility, surgical resection of adhesions is not always effective at reducing pain.</p><p>In our practice, we perform adhesiolysis selectively. We resect all adhesions that may compromise fertility or that correspond to the location of the patient's pain. We believe that comprehensive adhesiolysis is unwarranted because of the risk of injury to underlying critical structures (eg, blood vessels, nerves, or ureters) combined with the lack of consistent benefit.</p><p>Some women develop extensive pelvic adhesions that limit the mobility and visualization of the pelvic organs. This finding cannot always be anticipated prior to surgery and may limit the ability to adequately ablate or excise disease; more extensive surgery may be required. The term previously used for this was &quot;frozen pelvis.&quot; In current practice, this is described as deep infiltrating endometriosis (see <a href=\"#H29195061\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above). The operative goal is to re-establish normal anatomy. Prolonged postoperative administration of suppressive therapy helps to prevent recurrence.

When definitive surgery is performed, excision or ablation of peritoneal lesions and adhesiolysis are also typically performed. Endometriosis may cause extensive pelvic adhesions that can make hysterectomy by any route more difficult. A full discussion of hysterectomy and oophorectomy is presented separately.

In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, women who underwent operative laparoscopy were three times more likely to report improvement in pain at 12 months than controls who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy alone (73 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>While surgical treatment reduces pain, nearly 20 percent of patients will undergo repeat surgery within two years because of recurrent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risk of symptom recurrence is estimated to be as high as 40 percent at 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Risk factors for persistent or recurrent pain include incomplete excision of endometriosis, ovarian cyst drainage (compared with cyst excision), and ovarian conservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Advanced disease is less likely to be fully excised at the time of surgery and thus more likely to be associated with recurrent symptoms. As an example, in a multicenter prospective cohort study, women with stage III to IV disease had a higher recurrence rate than women with stage I to II disease at two years (14 versus 6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Outcomes for conservative and definitive surgery, including oophorectomy, are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H13645162\" class=\"local\">'Conservative versus definitive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>Because endometriosis-related pain symptoms generally resolve with menopause, the woman's age at time of surgery impacts surgical efficacy outcomes. A longer latency to menopause allows more time for symptoms to recur. In addition, women approaching menopause may be more willing to tolerate symptoms while awaiting menopause. In a retrospective study comparing the impact of laparoscopic resection and hysterectomy on reoperation rates, the reoperation rates in the laparoscopy group declined as the patients' ages increased (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0 for women aged 19 to 29, HR 0.39 for women aged 30 to 39, and HR 0.15 for women aged 40 or older) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Interestingly, increasing age did not impact the reoperation rate for women who underwent hysterectomy, with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This finding may reflect a true reduction in symptoms following hysterectomy regardless of age or may reflect the limited remaining surgical options for these women.</p><p>The impact of surgical treatment on fertility is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29195228\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29195236\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with position statements from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology advising postoperative medical suppressive therapy for most women treated surgically for endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Long-term medical suppression, defined as at least 6 to 24 months duration, can reduce symptom recurrence and thus avoid the need for multiple surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/2,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,70</a>]. As discussed above, conservative surgical treatment generally does not eliminate all disease or provide lifelong pain relief. Reoperation rates increase with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, multiple surgical procedures are undesirable because surgery has inherent risks, may increase adhesion formation that can cause pelvic pain, and may decrease ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The best evidence for the efficacy of postoperative suppressive were derived from two systematic reviews: levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNg IUD) for symptomatic endometriosis following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and postoperative use of oral contraceptive pills for prevention of anatomical relapse or symptom recurrence after conservative surgery for endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, one trial reported that postoperative use of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafarelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafarelin</a> significantly delayed the return of endometriosis-related symptoms compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Although a 2004 systematic review and meta-analysis of pre- and postoperative medical therapy with endometriosis surgery showed no evidence of benefit with postsurgical medical therapy, the meta-analysis had multiple limitations, including multiple drug regimens (GnRH analogue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, progestin, and oral contraceptive pills), variations in duration of follow-up, lack of data on time lapse to disease recurrence, the use of clinically unimportant end points (anatomic disease scores compared with patient pain scores), small sample sizes, and bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Because of these limitations and the relatively low risks of suppressive therapy, specialty societies advocate for the use of postoperative suppressive therapy until better data are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The options for postoperative medical therapy are the same as for initial medical therapy. Typically, first-line treatments are estrogen-progestin contraceptives or oral progestins alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], both of which are well-tolerated, low-risk, and cost-effective. Another option is an LNg IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If these options are not effective, patients may be treated with other hormonal agents (eg, GnRH agonists), although these are associated with more adverse effects. Longer-term (six months) postoperative use of GnRH agonist appears to be more effective than three months of treatment for decreasing the recurrence risk of endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. For women with refractory pain or inadequate response, treatment with aromatase inhibitors is another option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

There is no strong evidence that hormone therapy should be avoided in these women. In a 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of pain and disease recurrence in women with endometriosis who used hormone therapy for postsurgical menopause, hormone therapy was not associated with a statistical increase in pain or disease recurrence, but the number of patients was small and a clinically important difference cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is no outcomes-based evidence to support the addition of a progestin to prevent malignant transformation in residual endometriosis lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The relative risks and benefits of hormone therapy may depend on the size of the endometriotic implants. Women with peritoneal disease &gt;3 cm at the time of surgical resection had an increased risk of symptom recurrence when treated with estrogen therapy compared with women whose disease was less than 3 cm (9 versus 1 percent, respectively) in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, for women with significant residual endometriosis who have either moderate or severe symptoms or are younger than 45 years of age, the benefit of hormone therapy may outweigh the risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms may be initiated immediately after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Repeat surgery is often performed, yet there is limited benefit from undergoing serial conservative procedures.</p><p>A patient who presents with recurrent pelvic pain following surgical treatment is evaluated to ensure that the most likely cause is endometriosis. If the patient is not on medical therapy, medical therapy is initiated and other modalities may be added (eg, pelvic physical therapy). For treatment of recurrent pain after oophorectomy, suppression with a progestin is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Women who have already undergone conservative surgery are counseled regarding the risks and benefits of repeat conservative surgery compared with definitive surgery. (See <a href=\"#H13645162\" class=\"local\">'Conservative versus definitive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>There are limited data regarding the efficacy of repeat conservative surgeries.

Decisions regarding repeat conservative surgery must be individualized; there is no established maximum number of procedures. In our practice, we make this decision based upon patient preference and the following factors: (1) response to previous surgery (ie, the degree of symptom relief, the interval until symptoms recurred); (2) ability to tolerate medical therapy; and (3) patient age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13646060\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrapelvic sites</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragm &ndash; Lesions on the diaphragm are usually multiple and superficial, although some penetrate deeper into the muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89966\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89966 \">picture 1</a>). The surgeon must be aware that these lesions can be found in the posterior portion of the diaphragm and may be obscured by the liver during laparoscopy. Placing the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position allows visualization as the liver falls away from the diaphragm. Bilateral diaphragmatic lesions are rare. Symptoms usually include catamenial referred right shoulder pain, worsening discomfort in the recumbent position, and pain with breathing.

(See <a href=\"#H234318712\" class=\"local\">'General Principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is avoided in women with incompletely evaluated pelvic pain, with persistent pelvic pain after repeated surgeries, and women nearing menopause. (See <a href=\"#H234318712\" class=\"local\">'General Principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment of endometriosis may be a conservative (eg, laparoscopic excision <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ablation) or definitive procedure (hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Conservative surgery is the first-line surgical option for most women because it preserves fertility and hormone production, is less invasive and morbid than definitive surgery, and has documented short-term efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H13645162\" class=\"local\">'Conservative versus definitive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform hysterectomy rather than conservative surgery only for women with persistent bothersome symptoms of endometriosis who do not plan future childbearing and who have failed both medical therapy and at least one conservative surgery or for women who have additional indications for hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"#H13645162\" class=\"local\">'Conservative versus definitive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing hysterectomy for treatment of endometriosis, we suggest bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy <strong>ONLY</strong> for those who value decreasing the risk of reoperation more than avoiding the risks of premature menopause (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In general, a preference for oophorectomy is more likely as a woman approaches menopause. Oophorectomy is also reasonable for women with extensive disease involving the ovaries. (See <a href=\"#H13645162\" class=\"local\">'Conservative versus definitive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopy, particularly a first procedure, serves both a diagnostic and therapeutic purpose. The initial step is exploration of the pelvis and abdomen. Diagnosis of endometriosis by visual inspection of lesions at laparoscopy is considered satisfactory, although only histology of lesions that have been biopsied or excised can provide a definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H26900134\" class=\"local\">'Exploration and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the procedure is to destroy or remove all endometriotic implants. No single modality (ablation or excision) is superior. Lysis of pelvic adhesions is also required in most procedures. (See <a href=\"#H26899602\" class=\"local\">'Ablation versus excision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain relief is achieved in approximately 75 percent of patients who undergo laparoscopic ablation or excision of endometriosis. However, the risk of recurrence is estimated to be as high as 40 percent at 10 years follow-up, and approximately 20 percent of patients will undergo additional surgery within two years. (See <a href=\"#H234319114\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend postoperative medical suppressive therapy rather than no therapy for most women treated surgically for endometriosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
