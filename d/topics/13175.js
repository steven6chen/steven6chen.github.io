Torsades de pointes (TdP) or &quot;twisting of points&quot; is the specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with either form of the LQTS.</p><p>There are some pathophysiologic differences between the acquired and congenital forms of the LQTS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the acquired form, polymorphic VT is most commonly precipitated by a characteristic sequence of long-short RR intervals. This interval is normally caused by a ventricular premature beat followed by a compensatory pause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73827 \">waveform 1</a>). Polymorphic VT can similarly occur in association with bradycardia or frequent pauses; as a result, the acquired form of LQTS is called &quot;pause-dependent&quot; LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the inherited or congenital form, particularly with certain genotypes, TdP typically follows a sudden adrenergic surge. Such patients are considered to have &quot;catecholamine-dependent&quot; LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>However, these distinctions are not absolute. As an example, one observational study of 15 patients with congenital LQTS documented &quot;pause-dependent&quot; TdP, which is more characteristic of the acquired form, in 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of the long QT syndromes will be reviewed here. The causes, genetics, diagnosis, prognosis, and management are discussed separately.

Two leading pathophysiologic hypotheses have emerged to explain commonly observed features of LQTS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive and growing clinical and genetic evidence supports the importance of derangements in cardiac ion flows, resulting in prolongation of the action potential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63732\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63732 \">figure 1</a>). Based upon these data, congenital LQTS is considered a disease of ion channels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The observation that the immediate trigger for TdP in the inherited form is often a sudden surge in sympathetic tone (a feature not seen in the acquired form) led to the hypothesis that the congenital LQTS may be caused by an imbalance in the sympathetic innervation of the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Derangements in ion flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the leading pathophysiologic hypotheses focuses on derangements in cardiac ion flow, leading to increases in the action potential duration, early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. The latter change can be due both to an increase in time for repolarization and to oscillations in membrane potential called early afterdepolarizations (EADs) which are a form of triggered activity. Abnormalities in ion flow that prolong the action potential duration may lead to arrhythmias via reentrant mechanisms as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">The normal action potential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of normal cardiac cell electrophysiology is required in order to fully appreciate the proposed alteration in ion currents and electrophysiologic mechanisms which may underlie the long QT syndromes. The normal action potential (AP) is composed of the following five phases, beginning with phase four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71390 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61058\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61058 \">movie 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 4 represents the normal <strong>diastolic</strong> resting membrane potential of myocardial cells. Myocardial ventricular cell membranes during diastole are polarized at -90 mv (ie, the resting membrane potential), which largely represents the equilibrium potential for potassium. This occurs because most resting cardiac cell membranes are much more permeable to potassium than to sodium ions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 0 occurs when the membrane potential reaches -60 mv. A rapid inward flow of sodium ions through the fast sodium channels ensues and <strong>depolarizes</strong> the cell membrane. Inward current during phase 0 is also sustained by activation of L and T type calcium channels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 1 represents an initial repolarization after the overshoot of phase 0 and is caused by a transient outward potassium current.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 2 is called the plateau phase, because it represents an equilibrium between the inward calcium and delayed sodium currents and the outward potassium current (known as the delayed rectifier potassium current).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 3 represents the rapid repolarization which occurs when outward potassium current dominates over the decaying inward calcium current. Repolarization is predominantly effected through the outward (delayed) rectifying potassium current. These channels open in response to depolarization and allow potassium to flow out of cells and repolarize the membrane potential toward its resting level. The QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram is determined by the activity of these channels.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolonged repolarization and EADs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolongation of the QT interval may be associated with the presence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs). EADs are single or multiple oscillations of the membrane potential that can occur during phase 2 or 3 of the action potential. EADs occur in association with prolongation of the repolarization phase of the action potential.</p><p>Prolongation of repolarization results from a <strong>net reduction in the outward current</strong>, due to an increase in inward current, a decrease in outward current, or both. This may occur by one or more of three ionic mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of a delayed sodium current which occurs early during repolarization. This is the mechanism responsible for the QT prolongation seen with the drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased inward calcium current. Increases in intracellular calcium are caused by an elevation in transsarcolemmal calcium current due to either catecholamines or a rise in the extracellular calcium concentration.</p><p/><p>If occurring in phase 2 of the action potential, EADs are thought to be caused by increased inward current through L-type calcium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] or through the sodium-calcium exchanger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Depolarizing currents occurring late in phase 3 are thought to be due to inward currents through T-type calcium channels or sodium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decreased outward potassium current. This decreased outward current can be caused by either class IA or III antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 2</a>). Class IA agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>) block the outward delayed rectifier potassium current; in contrast, class III antiarrhythmic drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) block the rapid component of the delayed outward rectifier with a minimal effect on the inward rectifier current.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Triggered activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triggered responses or triggered activity are EADs that reach threshold potential, depolarize cell membranes, and result in additional action potentials. Propagation of these triggered responses produce ventricular premature depolarizations that may initiate polymorphic VT (TdP) in susceptible subjects. EADs and triggered responses are particularly easy to induce in Purkinje fibers and M cells, a group of cells in the left ventricular free wall which have recently been identified as the site of EAD-induced triggered activity after exposure to drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Common precipitants of EADs and triggered activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of EADs is potentiated by bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and a long list of medications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>). A few notable examples deserve emphasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradycardia &ndash; Slow heart rates are associated with increased inactivation of the outward repolarizing potassium current and a reduction in the Na-K-ATPase pump outward current (3 Na <span class=\"nowrap\">out/2</span> K in = net outward positive current). Slow heart rates also enhance the activity of certain antiarrhythmic drugs on repolarization (ie, repolarization and the QT interval are more prolonged). This property is called reverse use dependence and can lead to ion fluxes that facilitate EADs and TdP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia &ndash; Low potassium levels lead to decreased outward repolarizing current via reductions in electrogenic Na-K-ATPase pump activity and outward potassium channel activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiarrhythmic drugs &ndash; Class IA antiarrhythmic agents block both sodium and potassium channels, while the class III drugs block the potassium channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a>). Blockade of sodium channels would be expected to shorten the action potential duration, whereas blockade of potassium channels should prolong the action potential duration. At slow heart rates and low to normal concentrations of Class IA drugs, the potassium channel blocking activity predominates over the effect on the sodium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, EADs and TdP are more frequently seen with nontoxic levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>; supratherapeutic levels lead to increased sodium channel blocking activity and are rarely associated with QT prolongation and TdP.</p><p/><p>d,l-Sotalol (a class III antiarrhythmic drug with beta blocking activity) and the pure class III agents, such as d-sotalol (and probably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>), are potassium channel blockers that cause QT prolongation and are associated with TdP. Proarrhythmia, primarily TdP, occur in 2 to 7 percent of patients taking d,l-sotalol at doses of at least 320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> this complication is dose-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>d-Sotalol, the isomer of d,l-sotalol, is a pure class III agent that does not affect beta adrenergic receptors. It is associated with an increased rate of arrhythmias, including TdP as shown in the SWORD (Survival With Oral D-sotalol) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These findings led to the withdrawal of d-sotalol from the market.</p><p>Like other class III antiarrhythmic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> prolongs the time for repolarization in atrial and ventricular myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This effect is mediated by activation of a slow, delayed inward sodium current that occurs early during repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This is different from other class III agents which act by inhibiting outward potassium currents. In one report, nonsustained TdP occurred in 2.7 percent of patients treated with ibutilide, while a sustained event was seen in 1.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a>, a complex antiarrhythmic agent with potassium channel blocking activity, causes QT prolongation but is rarely associated with TdP. This disparate result may be due to the drug's multiple actions, including the blockade of sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, and of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The degree of drug-induced blockade of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier current appears to be dependent upon the extracellular potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Low extracellular potassium increases the drug block, while there is relative resistance to block when extracellular potassium levels are elevated as may occur with myocardial ischemia or rapid heart rates. This relationship may explain the reverse use-dependent effect of these drugs, ie, the degree of prolongation of repolarization is reduced as the stimulation rate increases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> &ndash; Ketoconazole and erythromycin both inhibit CYP3A. Individuals with low CYP3A activity may therefore be unable to oxidize drugs such as terfenadine, astemizole (both of which have been taken off the market), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a> when they are concurrently taking ketoconazole or erythromycin. These effects may lead to QT prolongation, resulting in TdP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, erythromycin alone can cause QT prolongation and TdP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection &ndash; QT prolongation and TdP have been reported in patients with HIV infection, even in the absence of drug therapy. In one study, 29 percent of hospitalized patients with HIV infection had QT prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Postulated mechanisms include myocarditis, a subclinical cardiomyopathy, or autonomic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased sympathetic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence supporting the significance of sympathetic activity in LQTS includes observations on the impact of the stellate ganglia. The activity of the left sympathetic stellate ganglion is greater than that of the right ganglion in normal individuals. In addition, the left stellate ganglion innervates the majority of the ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>].</p><p>Increased activity of the left stellate ganglion or reduced activity of the right stellate ganglion leads to increased sympathetic innervation of the heart. Studies in both animals and humans have demonstrated that right stellectomy or stimulation of the left stellate ganglion both prolong the QT interval and alter T wave morphology in a manner that mimics the surface ECG found in patients with LQTS. Furthermore, in a computer model sympathetic stimulation facilitated the induction of TdP by a number of mechanisms, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreasing the refractory period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Permitting earlier premature stimulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allowing reentry in the presence of the shorter refractory period</p><p/><p>In addition, sympathetic stimulation can also facilitate the induction of triggered activity and early after potentials. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prolonged repolarization and EADs'</a> above.)</p><p>Indirect clinical evidence also supports the hypothesis that increased sympathetic activity may underlie the pathophysiology of congenital LQTS. One study found that an infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> increased both transmural and spatial dispersion of repolarization in patients with LQTS; this effect was more pronounced in LQT1 compared to LQT2, possibly explaining why LQT1 patients are more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, antiadrenergic therapies, including beta blockers and left sympathectomy, substantially reduce the risk of TdP in patients with LQTS, despite the fact that they do not shorten the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of congenital long QT syndrome&quot;, section on 'Importance of genotype'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of congenital long QT syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical course'</a>.)</p><p>Additional support for the role of enhanced sympathetic activity comes from a study in which the heart rate was increased by atrial pacing in the absence of sympathetic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this setting, the QT interval shortened and QT dispersion (as determined by monophasic action potential duration) decreased in both control and LQTS patients. An infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> during atrial pacing blunted these effects on repolarization in the patients with LQTS but not the controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dispersion of repolarization and reentry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the dispersion of repolarization and reentry may be other potential mechanisms for the development of TdP. Dispersion of repolarization refers to an inhomogeneity in repolarization or recovery of excitability in a region of myocardium. A specific population of cells in the myocardium, called M cells, demonstrate marked prolongation of action potential duration in response to drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Dispersion of repolarization could therefore occur in response to these drugs if the action potential is prolonged in M cells but not in the surrounding myocardium. The result is a functional block in the M cell region, providing the necessary milieu for the development of a reentrant arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Alterations in sympathetic activity and dispersion of repolarization probably contribute to the electrophysiologic milieu that facilitates malignant arrhythmias, at least in certain cases.</p><p>Maintenance of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia may be due to repeated triggered responses, although reentry or abnormal automaticity could also be responsible. In an animal model using a voltage sensitive dye and high resolution video imaging of electrical waves, drug-induced polymorphic VT resulted from beat to beat changes in wave propagation patterns initiated by EADs or EAD-induced nonstationary vortex-like reentrant activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56857\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56857 \">waveform 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In another animal study, TdP consistently arose as a focal activity within the subendocardium, while subsequent beats were due to reentrant excitation in the form of rotating vortices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The VT ended when reentry terminated. The changing QRS axis usually coincided with the transient bifurcation of a predominantly single rotating vortex into two simultaneous vortices, involving the right and left ventricles separately. The bifurcation resulted from the development of functional conduction block within the right ventricle. In other cases, the axis shift was due to a single localized circuit which varied in location and orientation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that the prolonged QT interval seen in the congenital LQTS is the result of an abnormality in an ion channel and therefore in ion conductance. Observations in the genetic forms of the LQTS are consistent with this hypothesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ensuing delay in repolarization and an associated dispersion of heterogeneity may serve as the substrate upon which the following may occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heightened sympathetic tone can initiate the development of EADs and triggered activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reentry may result with the initiation and, in some instances, maintenance of an arrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2527194023\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Mark E.
