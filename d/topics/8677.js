The most common acquired occupational lung diseases include occupational asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute toxic inhalant syndromes, pneumoconioses, and tumors. </p><p>Among these, occupational asthma is likely the most common, yet it displays only limited imaging manifestations. The other diseases, including the pneumoconioses, yield characteristic imaging features that are the focus of this review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of asbestosis, berylliosis, flock worker's lung, and silicosis, as well as a general approach to the evaluation of interstitial lung disease, are discussed separately.

Pneumoconioses result from inhalation and deposition of inorganic particles and mineral dust with subsequent reaction of the lung. Pneumoconioses can be subdivided into fibrogenic (eg, silica, coal, talc, asbestos), benign or inert (eg, iron, tin, barium), granulomatous (eg, beryllium), and giant cell pneumonia associated with hard metal inhalation (eg, cobalt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Occupational exposure to certain organic dusts, molds, and chemicals can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an inflammatory reaction that is reversible if exposure is stopped in the acute or subacute phases. In unusual circumstances, organic particles like nylon flock can induce interstitial lung disease when inhaled by workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flock-workers-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flock worker's lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inhalation of noxious gases and fumes can lead to noncardiogenic, increased permeability, pulmonary edema, constrictive bronchiolitis, or irritant-induced asthma, while byssinosis refers to an acute bronchoconstrictor response to inhalation of raw cotton, hemp, or flax, especially with exposure to bales of cotton, spinning, or carding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Except for noncardiogenic, increased permeability, pulmonary edema, pulmonary function tests show airflow limitation, but the chest radiograph is normal. (See <a href=\"#H1448618047\" class=\"local\">'Noxious fumes and gases'</a> below and <a href=\"#H383592703\" class=\"local\">'Byssinosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Four criteria have to be fulfilled in order to secure a diagnosis of occupational lung disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documented exposure to a noxious agent known to induce disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clearly defined latent period between exposure to the suspected agent and the development of disease symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations compatible with the recognized features of the diseases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of other disease entities that could conceivably be responsible for the clinical picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365264491\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING CHARACTERISTICS OF PNEUMOCONIOSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiography remains the initial imaging modality and represents the cornerstone for evaluation of workers according to the International Labor Office (ILO) classification. Despite the importance of chest radiography as a screening test for detection of parenchymal and pleural abnormalities, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), also called thin-section computed tomography, has higher sensitivity and specificity and is better able to characterize the pattern of parenchymal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Thus, in symptomatic workers, HRCT is used to identify disease not detected by chest radiograph and to clarify the pattern of disease when the chest radiographic diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Pleural abnormalities are also more reliably detected and characterized with CT scanning. </p><p>FDG-PET scanning can be useful in differentiating fibrotic conglomerate masses from active inflammatory masses and neoplastic lesions, although it may not be able to differentiate between active inflammation and neoplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365264498\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of imaging findings in occupational lung diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of imaging findings have been associated with occupational exposures. Some are pathognomonic, such as focal regions of parietal or diaphragmatic pleural thickening consistent with pleural plaques with or without calcifications seen following asbestos exposure, while others are strongly suggestive, such as the multiple, sharply marginated, small rounded opacities in the upper lung regions in silicosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse lung disease is a feature of mineral dust-induced pneumoconiosis, organic dust-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema induced by toxic fumes (NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CL, NH<sub>3</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperexpansion of lungs can result from diffuse constrictive bronchiolitis (bronchiolitis obliterans), such as after exposure to toxic fumes. Similar hyperexpansion can occur in severe, chronic asthma or advanced emphysema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longstanding occupational exposure can sometimes have a predominant effect in a focal area of lung. Examples include conglomerate masses, also called progressive massive fibrosis in complicated silicosis or coal worker's pneumoconiosis; post-primary tuberculosis as a sequela of exposure to silica, and tumors (eg, after exposure to silica dust or asbestos in a cigarette smoker) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural disease can be induced by asbestos fibers (eg, pleural plaques, benign asbestos-related pleural effusion, diffuse pleural thickening, malignant mesothelioma) and be a sign post for the cause of associated parenchymal lung disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952818691\"><span class=\"h2\">The International Labor Office classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1919, the League of Nations founded the International Labor Office (ILO) in order to study the epidemiology, classification, and prevention of occupational lung diseases. As part of this process, a working classification of chest radiographs in persons with pneumoconiosis was introduced in 1930 and has been revised a number of times since [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The ILO classification uses graphic descriptors, includes image quality assessment, and provides standard images. A high degree of reader variability can be observed depending on reader training and experience with the ILO classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This classification is predominantly used for research and for screening and surveillance of workers in dusty occupations and as part of an examination for disability claims. It is not used in routine clinical care. It is presented here to provide an overview and to help classify the patterns that are typical for the different pneumoconioses.</p><p>In the ILO classification, multiple criteria are analyzed and characterized: exam quality, size, shape, distribution, and profusion of small opacities (rounded or irregular), presence and size of large opacities, presence and type of pleural abnormalities, as well as other important abnormalities. All of these features are characterized and coded according to a lexicon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91554\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef91554 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91555 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96495 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96496 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>Small opacities are categorized according to shape and size. Small rounded opacities are named p (&le;1.5 mm), q (1.6 to 3 mm), or r (&gt;3 to 10 mm). Small, irregular opacities are classified by width, as s (&le;1.5 mm), t (1.6 to 3 mm), or u (&gt;3 to 10 mm). The lungs are roughly subdivided into three zones: upper, middle, and lower zone or region.</p><p>Large opacities are defined as lesions greater than 1 cm in diameter. One or more large opacities whose longest dimensions do not exceed about 50 mm form category A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91559\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91559 \">image 1</a>). One or more large opacities whose combined longest dimensions exceed 50 mm, but do not exceed the equivalent area of the right upper lung zone form category B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91560\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91560 \">image 2</a>). One or more large opacities whose combined longest dimensions exceed the equivalent area of the right upper lung zone form category C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91561\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91561 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365264528\"><span class=\"h1\">FEATURES OF INDIVIDUAL PNEUMOCONIOSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The individual pneumoconioses have typical presentations that are helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of workers who may have been exposed. A summary of these findings is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91633 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952818812\"><span class=\"h2\">Silicosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Silicosis results from inhalation of crystalline silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in quartz, granite, or sandstone with subsequent fibrotic lung reaction and represents the most widespread pneumoconiosis in the United States. Occupations at risk for silicosis include mining, quarrying, drilling, and sandblasting. </p><p>Silica particles need to have a diameter of less than 5 micrometers in order to reach alveoli. These toxic particles are phagocytized by macrophages that decay. Subsequent extrusion of lysosomal enzymes perpetuates the damage wrought by free silica particles. Consequently, radiographically visible lung disease continues to progress even after cessation of active exposure to silica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Silicosis progresses through stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Simple silicosis</strong> is characterized by innumerable, sharply marginated, small rounded opacities composed of hyalinized, collagenous nodules, with a predilection for dorsal aspects of the upper lobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91454\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91454 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91455\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91455 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91556\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91556 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91557\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91557 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91558\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91558 \">image 8</a>). High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung commonly shows bilateral, symmetric, centrilobular, and perilymphatic nodules with sharp margination. These nodules can calcify in 10 to 20 percent of patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated silicosis </strong>refers to the confluence of small collagenous silicotic nodules that results in formation of large opacities, exceeding 1 cm in diameter. This confluence evolves into progressive massive fibrosis or conglomerate masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91456\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91456 \">image 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91534\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91534 \">image 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91533\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91533 \">image 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91559\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91559 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91560\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91560 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91561\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91561 \">image 3</a>) that represent the hallmark of complicated silicosis. Conglomerate masses have a bias for the upper lobes and tend to migrate towards the hilar regions with sharp peripheral and poorly marginated medial margins, creating so-called &quot;angel wings&quot; appearance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On CT scans, paracicatricial emphysema is a common occurrence in the periphery of these masses. Conglomerate masses are frequently hypermetabolic on positron emission tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. During the evolution of large opacities, the small rounded nodules become less conspicuous. This conversion from simple to complicated silicosis may take more than 10 years. Slowly progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with a pattern typical of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) may occur in about 10 percent of patients with longstanding silicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with established silicosis exhibit an increased risk of lung cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91457\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91457 \">image 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H13566521\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Chest imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement</strong> due to reactive lymph node hyperplasia is relatively common in patients with silicosis and typically affects nodes at stations 4R, 4L, 7, and 8 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63771 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Punctate calcification in the lymph nodes is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, calcium salt deposits in the marginal lymph node sinus lead to characteristic eggshell calcification of lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91535\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91535 \">image 13</a>). This development can be seen in up to 5 percent of workers with silicosis. Eggshell calcifications can also be found in coal worker's pneumoconiosis, long-standing sarcoidosis, or treated lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tuberculosis</strong> occurs preferentially in patients with silicosis, displaying characteristic imaging features of post-primary tuberculosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91459\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91459 \">image 14</a>). This common association of tuberculosis with silicosis is found in up to 25 percent of affected workers and may be related to the toxic effect of crystalline silica on alveolar macrophages with subsequent weakening of innate immune responses and increased susceptibility to mycobacteria. Tuberculous upper lobe masses, consolidations, or cavities need to be differentiated from conglomerate masses of complicated silicosis or bronchogenic carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute silicosis</strong> is a rare manifestation of massive, rapid exposure to silica dust [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In particular, sandblasters, including denim sandblasters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], can be exposed over a period of only several months to excessive concentrations of silica crystals that overwhelm alveolar macrophages. Subsequently, type II pneumocytes phagocytose dust and produce large amounts of surfactant. The result is silicoproteinosis with alveolar filling, similar to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, also known as pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91460\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91460 \">image 15</a>). Radiographic findings include diffuse ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and a &quot;crazy paving&quot; pattern with interlobular septal thickening and intralobular lines on a background of ground-glass opacity on HRCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural abnormalities in silicosis have been underemphasized and include unexplained pleural effusions in 11 percent and pleural thickening in up to 58 percent of affected workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Rounded atelectasis may be seen as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Parenchymal pseudoplaques have been described and occur due to coalescence of subpleural lung parenchymal nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>An increased incidence of autoimmune diseases is seen in workers with silicosis. Erasmus syndrome refers to the possible association of occupational exposure to silica with the development of scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/16,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26-30</a>]. The role of silica exposure as a potential risk factor for scleroderma is discussed separately.

CWP has similar radiographic features to silicosis, but is classified as a separate disease due to its rather characteristic pathologic findings. In simple CWP, pigment and reticulin fibers accumulate in a peribronchiolar location. Over time, large amorphous black masses develop that occasionally have a liquified center. Subsequent cavitation can be the result of ischemic necrosis or post-primary tuberculosis.</p><p>Radiologically, these pathological findings produce small, rounded, nodular opacities, less than 1 cm in diameter, with a preference for the upper lobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91545\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91545 \">image 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91546\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91546 \">image 17</a>). This form is called simple coal worker's pneumoconiosis. Eventually, confluence and development of large opacities lead to the formation of complicated coal worker's pneumoconiosis with progressive massive fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91622\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91622 \">image 18</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91623\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91623 \">image 19</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91624\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91624 \">image 20</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The same predilection for the upper lobes is observed in coal worker's pneumoconiosis as in silicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/17,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,32</a>].</p><p>A substantial minority (10 to 40 percent) of coal miners with coal worker's pneumoconiosis develop diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, displaying small irregular opacities in the lower lung regions on chest radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These reticular opacities correlate better with the degree of pathophysiologic impairment of lung function than the concurrent small rounded opacities. On thin-section CT scanning these reticular opacities can be accompanied by honeycombing and have a similarity to UIP. This pattern of pulmonary fibrosis can be associated with bronchogenic carcinoma in the region of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is commonly used to evaluate lung nodules. In six patients with CWP and a total of 19 nodules &gt;1 cm, FDG-PET showed positive uptake in 18 of the nodules, although pathologic examination and follow-up did not find any evidence of malignant tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Due to the high rate of false positive results, FDG-PET imaging is of limited utility in diagnosing malignant tumors in CWP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Caplan syndrome is a rare complication of coal worker's pneumoconiosis that occurs concurrently with joint manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. In this disorder peripheral lung nodules with the histopathology of rheumatoid nodules develop on a background of pneumoconiotic opacities. The syndrome was first described in Welsh coal miners, but can be observed in other pneumoconioses as well. Radiologically, these workers develop typically bilateral, peripheral nodules 5 mm to 5 cm in size. In contrast to pneumoconiotic masses, they can develop rapidly, over a period of weeks, and may cavitate or calcify. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365264556\"><span class=\"h2\">Talcosis and talc granulomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talc powder is composed of crystalline hydrous magnesium silicate. Occupational exposure to talc (eg, ceramic, paper, plastics, rubber, paint, and cosmetic industries) can lead to formation of rounded small opacities in the lung similar to silicosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91462\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91462 \">image 21</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. CT imaging shows small centrilobular and subpleural nodules, conglomerate masses with focal areas of high attenuation, and focal ground-glass opacities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-of-occupational-lung-diseases/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

These disorders include interstitial lung disease (pneumoconiosis and occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, and tumors. (See <a href=\"#H365264470\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumoconioses result from inhalation and deposition of inorganic particles and mineral dust with subsequent reaction of the lung. Pneumoconioses can be subdivided into fibrogenic (eg, silica, coal, talc, asbestos), benign or inert (eg, iron, tin, barium), granulomatous (eg, beryllium which induces a sarcoid-like reaction), and giant cell pneumonia in cobalt inhalation. (See <a href=\"#H952818870\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumoconioses are usually diagnosed by a positive exposure history and suggestive radiographic presentation. An understanding of the pathology and radiographic appearance facilitates the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of these workers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91633 \">table 1</a>). The ILO classification de-emphasizes the characteristic radiologic presentation and emphasizes the combination of radiologic suspicion and exposure history. (See <a href=\"#H952818870\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H365264491\" class=\"local\">'Imaging characteristics of pneumoconioses'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the typical radiographic appearance of the most common pneumoconioses, tissue biopsy is usually not required to establish the diagnosis when the exposure history and radiographic pattern are characteristic. (See <a href=\"#H365264491\" class=\"local\">'Imaging characteristics of pneumoconioses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse lung disease is a feature of mineral dust-induced pneumoconiosis, organic dust-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema induced by toxic fumes. (See <a href=\"#H365264498\" class=\"local\">'Types of imaging findings in occupational lung diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperexpansion of lungs can result from diffuse constrictive bronchiolitis (bronchiolitis obliterans), such as after exposure to toxic fumes. Similar hyperinflation can occur in severe, chronic asthma or emphysema. (See <a href=\"#H365264498\" class=\"local\">'Types of imaging findings in occupational lung diseases'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1448618047\" class=\"local\">'Noxious fumes and gases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain longstanding occupational exposures can result in a characteristic effect on a focal area of lung. Examples include conglomerate masses in complicated silicosis or coal worker's pneumoconiosis; post-primary tuberculosis as a sequela of exposure to silica, and tumors (eg, after exposure to silica or asbestos in a cigarette smoker). (See <a href=\"#H952818812\" class=\"local\">'Silicosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H365264535\" class=\"local\">'Coal worker's pneumoconiosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H365264577\" class=\"local\">'Bronchogenic carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural plaques are the most common manifestation of asbestos exposure. They are a sign post of prior asbestos exposure and are helpful when evaluating a patient with diffuse interstitial lung disease. (See <a href=\"#H61425693\" class=\"local\">'Pleural disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Labor Office uses a standardized system for the classification of radiographic abnormalities associated with occupational lung disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91554\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef91554 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91555 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96495 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F96496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96496 \">figure 3</a>). This classification is predominantly used for research, for screening and surveillance of workers in dusty occupations, and for the purpose of disability claims, but not for routine clinical care.
