Teenagers and children &lt;2 years of age who present with AIHA are more likely to have an underlying systemic illness (secondary AIHA) and a more chronic course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of AIHA are nonspecific and are common to other types of hemolytic anemia. Symptoms are generally determined by the severity of hemolysis and the clinical presentation may range from asymptomatic (patients with mild anemia) to severe and life-threatening (patients with acute profound anemia).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Presenting symptoms</strong> &ndash; Most children with AIHA present with signs and symptoms referable to anemia (eg, weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, pallor), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemolysis (eg, jaundice, icterus, painless dark urine). Other nonspecific symptoms include abdominal pain or fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a study of 26 children with warm AIHA, the most common presenting symptoms were pallor (100 percent), jaundice (59 percent), and fever (39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In most cases of AIHA, the anemia develops gradually and the child is typically well-compensated from a cardiovascular standpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rarely, profound anemia develops acutely resulting in a severe, life-threatening presentation. In an observational cohort study of 265 children with AIHA, 3 percent presented with collapse, coma, or acute kidney injury due to acute profound anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with cold agglutinin disease may have symptoms related to the agglutination of red cells upon exposure to cold ambient temperatures. The most common manifestation of this is acrocyanosis, a dark, purple to gray discoloration of the skin on the most acral parts: fingertips, toes, nose, and ears. These changes disappear upon warming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Passage of painless dark urine, in colors ranging from gold to red to black, usually signifies hemoglobinuria secondary to intravascular hemolysis, and is suggestive of cold-reactive AIHA such as cold agglutinin disease or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. In contrast, patients with warm AIHA do not typically have hemoglobinuria unless there is a component of complement fixation.

Patients with primary AIHA usually have a benign previous medical history. Previous blood cell counts (if obtained) are typically normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The family history may reveal a history of immune disorders. In an observational study of 265 children with AIHA, a history of autoimmune disease or primary immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives was noted in 12 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The review of systems should focus on any recent acute infectious illness, signs and symptoms of a potential underlying systemic illness, and concurrent medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109693 \">table 4</a>).

The strength of the DAT positivity is generally correlated with the severity of hemolysis. In &lt;5 percent of childhood cases, the DAT is negative despite good clinical evidence for the presence of warm AIHA. In such cases, the amount of IgG on the erythrocyte may be below the threshold for detection by standard DAT and may require other methods for detection.

First, an autoantibody with a &quot;panreactive&quot; pattern (which is the most common finding) will bind all cells, rendering the identification of fully compatible blood for transfusion difficult or impossible. Second, identification of the antigenic specificity also can help predict intravascular lysis caused by complement activation. If the antigen is within the Rhesus (Rh) complex, complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis is unlikely. The P antigen system, in contrast, is capable of binding sufficient immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to allow Donath-Landsteiner antibodies (IgG antibodies that react with the red cell at reduced temperature but not at 37&deg;C) to fix complement completely and allow intravascular lysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-in-children-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The main differential diagnosis includes causes of nonimmune hemolytic anemia, such as hemoglobinopathies, intrinsic red cell membrane or enzyme defects, and extrinsic causes of hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64454 \">table 6</a>). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) differentiates AIHA from other causes of hemolytic anemia.

Measurement of transaminases and coagulation factors can be useful in assessing hepatic function. In hemolytic anemia, the indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin fraction is typically elevated. In contrast, an elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin level suggests the presence of intrinsic liver disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-causes-of-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and causes of jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dark urine</strong> &ndash; Patients with AIHA often present with dark urine caused by intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Other causes of dark urine include concentrated urine, bilirubin or porphyrin precursors in the urine, hematuria, and myoglobinuria. Hemoglobinuria can be distinguished from most of these on the basis of the urinalysis (in patients with hemoglobinuria, the dipstick test is positive for blood and protein, but the microscopic analysis does not reveal red blood cells). Myoglobinuria produces similar urinalysis findings and can be distinguished from hemoglobinemia on the basis of the serum haptoglobin level, which is typically normal in the absence of hemolysis.
