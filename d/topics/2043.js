He attributed these symptoms to clams eaten 14 hours before the onset of symptoms. On day 3, the gastrointestinal symptoms continued and he developed transient lightheadedness. He presented to the hospital on day 4 with continued urticaria, gastrointestinal discomfort, and mild tachycardia.

He was treated with parenteral &quot;antihistamine and corticosteroid&quot; and observed for 45 minutes in his home. The urticaria subsided, and the clinician left the home. Approximately 40 minutes after the departure of the clinician, the patient again developed urticaria, followed by angioedema of the neck. The symptoms worsened, and the clinician was called back. The patient died, despite attempts at resuscitation. The autopsy showed &quot;generalized edema of the lungs, brain, glottis, and bowels, due to the severe characteristic systemic compromise of anaphylaxis.&quot;</p><p>The remainder of this topic will focus on biphasic anaphylaxis, since more data are available regarding biphasic compared with protracted reactions, and biphasic reactions occurring after a patient has been discharged pose the greatest clinical dilemma for the treating clinician.

The majority of studies found that recurrent symptoms are usually less severe than the initial symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13,15,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,32-34</a>]. Urticaria seems to be particularly common during the second wave of symptoms, and this is often the only symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the second phase of an anaphylaxis episode can be more severe or even fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13,16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of recurrent symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The period of time between resolution of initial symptoms and onset of recurrent symptoms varies substantially. Studies have reported asymptomatic intervals ranging from 1 to 30 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/8,15-17,22,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15-17,22,35</a>]. One study reported a biphasic reaction that occurred 72 hours after the resolution of initial symptoms, although this appears to be an exception to the usual temporal pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In a large study involving 103 patients who were contacted within 72 hours of an emergency department visit for anaphylaxis, the average time to onset of recurrent symptoms was 10 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, 40 percent of patients in this series had recurrent symptoms more than 10 hours after resolution of initial symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">THEORIES OF PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of biphasic anaphylaxis is not known, although several theories have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One theory propounds that the biphasic response, like allergic responses seen in the skin and the respiratory tract following allergen challenge, is due to the influx of inflammatory cells that occurs in response to cytokines and chemotactic factors released during the initial response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Mast cell degranulation is responsible for the initial symptoms in the skin following injection of allergen or in the lung following inhalation of allergen. This is followed over the next two to eight hours by a highly reproducible influx of other inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes. These cells are responsible for delayed swelling at the site of skin testing and the late-phase asthmatic response. In keeping with this theory is the observation that the severity of anaphylactic events correlates with the level of inflammatory mediators that have chemotactic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammatory potential, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and complement components C3a and C4a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13,16,27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,27,32</a>]. In addition, the frequency of biphasic reactions have been found to correlate with the levels of mast cell tryptase, histamine, and the cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The above model does not account for the variability seen in biphasic anaphylactic responses. Recurrent symptoms can occur as early as one hour and as late as three days after resolution of the first reaction, and this period is highly variable from patient to patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histologic findings in biphasic anaphylaxis do not support the above theory either. Studies of patients experiencing fatal biphasic reactions most often lack the characteristic inflammatory cell infiltrates in organs involved in the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The cell that accumulates in the tissues after fatal anaphylaxis is usually the eosinophil, and in some reports, no cellular infiltrate is found at all.</p><p/><p>Other theories of the pathogenesis of biphasic allergic reactions include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biphasic response is related to a second wave of mast cell degranulation. In some murine models of anaphylaxis, it was noted that orally administered antigens could result in biphasic degranulation of mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Peak periods of mediator release consistently occurred at 30 minutes and 72 hours after a single oral challenge. An inflammatory infiltrate was apparent by 72 hours. However, this model would not explain cases of biphasic anaphylaxis in humans that occur quickly (ie, 1 to 8 hours after resolution of the first response).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a murine model of penicillin-induced anaphylaxis, it was found that a late occurring synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) was responsible for a second delayed reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This was in part due to release of TNF-alpha from mast cells during the initial reaction because inhibition of TNF-alpha inhibition resulted in ablation of both the late-phase response and the late increase in PAF. The role of PAF in murine anaphylaxis is well-established. Also, serum PAF levels are significantly elevated in humans with severe or fatal anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another theory suggests that biphasic responses have no unique pathogenesis, but simply represent a protracted event that undergoes a temporary remission and then recurs when therapy &quot;wears off.&quot; In this theory, the biphasic reaction is simply a form of a protracted reaction with only two phases. However, it seems unlikely that this explanation would account for episodes occurring as late as 24 hours or later after the event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A final theory about the pathogenesis of biphasic anaphylaxis implicates uneven antigen absorption. Some series reported that biphasic reactions were more common following oral allergen exposure, although intravenously administered antigens have also caused biphasic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the data available, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop a biphasic response. Several features of the initial anaphylactic event have been cited as possible risk factors for the development of a second phase, although none have been established as definite, and studies have reached contradictory conclusions in some cases. The following discussion will focus on the findings from prospective studies when possible, since these are less prone to bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13,26,27,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26,27,32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe initial symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies in both adults and children reported that markers of severe initial reactions were more common among patients who subsequently had recurrent symptoms, suggesting that severity of the initial reaction might be a risk factor. Specifically, the need for more than one dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or intravenous fluids for hypotension were noted. However, these results, obtained in retrospective studies, were confirmed in some, but not all prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13,27,32,33,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27,32,33,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Suboptimal or delayed treatment of initial reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings of several studies suggest that patients who developed biphasic reactions received less aggressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed treatment for their initial symptoms, compared with patients with uniphasic reactions.</p><p>A retrospective review of 282 patients presenting to an emergency department with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis reported that biphasic reactions occurred in 5.3 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients with biphasic responses took three times longer to arrive at the emergency department after the onset of their first symptoms compared with uniphasic reactors, suggesting the delayed treatment of initial symptoms might increase the risk of recurrent symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> appeared to predispose to biphasic events in a retrospective study of 105 children with nonfatal anaphylaxis, of whom 6 percent had biphasic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among the biphasic reactors, the median time from the onset of symptoms to the initial administration of epinephrine was 190 minutes, compared with 48 minutes for those with uniphasic reactions. The severity of reaction and the percentage of patients treated with epinephrine or glucocorticoids did not differ between those with uniphasic and biphasic reactions. In the large study involving 103 patients, of whom 20 had biphasic reactions, there was a small but statistically significant difference between uniphasic and biphasic reactors with regard to the dose of epinephrine administered during initial treatment, with uniphasic and biphasic receiving 0.39 and 0.30 mg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are not believed to alter immediate events in anaphylaxis, since mast cells are relatively resistant to their pharmacologic effects. Glucocorticoids are administered in the treatment of anaphylaxis largely based upon the theory that they may prevent or reduce the later inflammatory changes that follow. However, the evidence in support of this practice is weak. In the study of 103 patients mentioned previously, more uniphasic reactors received glucocorticoids and at higher doses (55 percent, average dose 63 mg) compared with biphasic reactors (35 percent, 31 mg), although this fell just short of statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other studies have found no evidence that glucocorticoids reduce the rates of biphasic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed resolution of initial symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the study of 103 patients described previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], uniphasic reactors responded more quickly to initial treatment compared with biphasic reactors (ie, resolution in 112 versus 133 minutes). In addition, when patients with biphasic symptoms beginning <strong>later than</strong> <strong>nine hours</strong> after initial resolution (&quot;later biphasic reactors&quot;) were compared with those with recurrent symptoms in one to eight hours, the later biphasic reactors were even slower to respond to initial treatment (ie, resolution in 193 versus 133 minutes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Ingested allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective series of 25 patients found that recurrent or prolonged reactions were more likely if the offending agent had been administered by mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a subsequent larger study did not confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of recurrent symptoms is unpredictable. In most patients, recurrent symptoms are less severe than the initial symptoms, and isolated urticaria is common.
