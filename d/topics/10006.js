(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The only potentially curative treatment options are resection and liver transplantation. Among patients who are not candidates for liver resection, some who have cirrhosis and HCC are candidates for potentially curative liver transplantation. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are not eligible for either resection or transplantation because of tumor extent, underlying liver dysfunction, and lack of donor organs. This has led to the development of many other treatments and combinations for treatment of HCC including local tumor ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment algorithms for HCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several therapeutic options for treatment of localized HCC. A general approach to treatment is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57014 \">algorithm 1</a>). An alternative treatment algorithm has been published by the Barcelona group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>However, attempts to generate algorithmic approaches to the treatment of HCC are difficult since new treatments and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches tend to vary based upon the available expertise. These issues and a general approach to treatment of HCC are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVOLUTION OF TRANSPLANTATION FOR HCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver transplantation for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is attractive because resection of the malignant tumor can be achieved while also replacing the cirrhotic liver that remains at risk for the development of new lesions. However, early experience with transplantation for patients with unresectable local HCC was disappointing. Unacceptable 90-day mortality rates, tumor recurrence in up to 80 percent of patients, and long-term survival rates that were well below that of patients transplanted for nonmalignant disease all reflected the advanced nature of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>A change in the philosophy of transplantation for HCC evolved with the finding that small, incidentally found HCC in explanted livers did not adversely affect survival of patients undergoing liver transplantation for other conditions when compared with patients whose livers did not contain a malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, an increasing number of retrospective studies suggested that liver transplantation was as effective and possibly more effective than alternative therapies in carefully selected subgroups of patients.</p><p>Liver transplantation for HCC will be discussed here. Partial hepatectomy and nonsurgical options for liver-isolated disease (ie, cryoablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation [microwave], and transarterial chemoembolization), as well as the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of HCC, are reviewed separately (see appropriate topic reviews). An overview of treatment approaches for HCC is also presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with localized HCC who are not candidates for resection, orthotopic liver transplantation is an appropriate strategy for patients with a single lesion &le;5 cm, up to three separate lesions, none larger than 3 cm, no evidence of gross vascular invasion, and no regional nodal or extrahepatic distant metastases. When these criteria are strictly applied, five-year survival rates 75 percent or higher can be achieved. Overall survival in carefully selected patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for HCC is similar to or only slightly worse than the survival of patients undergoing OLT for nonmalignant causes. Although randomized trials have not been carried out, uncontrolled series suggest that survival following OLT is as good or better than it is after alternative treatments for HCC in carefully selected patients.</p><p>The landmark study of Mazzaferro in 1996 established deceased-donor liver transplantation (OLT) as a viable option for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They showed that when transplantation was restricted to patients with early HCC (defined as single lesion &le;5 cm, up to three separate lesions, none larger than 3 cm, no evidence of gross vascular invasion, and no regional nodal or distant metastases), a four-year survival rate of 75 percent could be achieved. These outcomes are similar to expected survival rates for patients undergoing transplantation for cirrhosis without HCC. These criteria have become known as the Milan criteria and have been widely applied around the world in the selection of patients with HCC for liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Considerable interest has arisen in expansion of these transplant criteria in highly specialized centers, although such expanded criteria remain purely investigational at present. This subject is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Expanded transplant criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Extrahepatic staging in patients being considered for transplantation should include computed tomography (CT) of the chest and CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Bone scan was previously required, but this was changed in December 2012. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Requirements for listing and management while on the wait list'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival compared with transplantation for other reasons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall survival in carefully selected patients undergoing OLT for HCC is similar to or only slightly worse than survival of patients undergoing OLT for nonmalignant causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>Analysis of data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) provides the most important comparative information about the outcomes in patients undergoing OLT for HCC as compared with nonmalignant disease. The most recent report from UNOS focused on 34,324 liver transplants performed between 1987 and 2001, 985 of which were done for HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When three different time periods were compared (1987 to 1991, 1992 to 1995, and 1996 to 2001) the five-year survival rates for patients undergoing OLT for HCC increased significantly (25 versus 47 and 61 percent, respectively) despite longer average waiting periods in more recent years (37 versus 103 and 215 days, respectively). In contrast, the five-year survival rate for control patients who underwent OLT for nonmalignant reasons was 71 percent and did not change over the study period. These data suggest that the better results with OLT for HCC are more likely attributable to improved patient selection rather than better technique and posttransplant care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Prognostic factors for posttransplant survival were evaluated in another report from an international tumor registry that included 790 patients with HCC who were followed for an average of 30 months after OLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among the variables that adversely affected overall <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence-free survival were histologic grade of differentiation, size &gt;5 cm, involved lymph nodes, bilobar tumor involvement, and vascular invasion. Prognostic factors are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes and prognostic factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival in comparison to other types of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No large randomized trials have directly compared OLT with other forms of therapy for early HCC. Retrospective studies that included adjustment for disease severity suggest that survival following OLT is as good or better than after alternative treatments in carefully selected patients. For patients with anatomically resectable HCC and adequate hepatic reserve, resection remains the standard with which alternative treatment methods must be compared.</p><p>Observational series suggest that long-term results after transplantation are at least as good and may be superior to those of resection in some groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/4,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series from Pittsburgh included 181 patients with HCC, of whom 105 underwent OLT while 76 were resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. During 37 to 53 months of follow-up, no significant differences in survival emerged between the OLT and resection groups when patients without cirrhosis were considered. However, when HCC was associated with cirrhosis, survival rates after OLT were significantly better than those after resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar conclusions were drawn in a series of 102 patients with HCC, 50 of whom underwent transplantation and 52 potentially curative liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Overall, three-year survival and recurrence rates were similar in both groups. However, OLT was associated with significantly better outcomes among cirrhotic patients (three-year survival rate 48 versus 23 percent) and those with tumors &lt;3 cm (76 versus 33 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparable results were noted in a report comparing outcomes from liver resection and OLT in 120 cirrhotic patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The patient groups were comparable with respect to underlying disease, age, and tumor size, although as expected, resected patients were more often Child class A and B cirrhotics. Despite the apparent advantage for resection candidates, the rate of survival without recurrence significantly favored the transplanted group (46 versus 27 percent) even among patients with one or two small (&lt;3 cm) tumors (three-year recurrence-free survival 83 versus 18 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survival benefit for transplantation was also suggested in a study of 533 (predominantly cirrhotic) patients with HCC who had been treated with OLT, resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Analysis was stratified according to the number of lesions, stage of disease, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, Child-Pugh class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>), and viral versus alcoholic cirrhosis. A survival benefit was observed in patients undergoing OLT as compared with other treatments: three- and five-year survivals were 72 and 68 percent for OLT, as compared with 64 and 44 percent for resection, 54 and 36 percent for PEI, and 32 and 22 percent for TACE. The benefit of transplantation was mainly evident in patients with monofocal HCC &lt;5 cm.</p><p/><p>An important caveat is that the results of transplantation cited above include only patients who actually received a transplant. Not included are patients with HCC who were listed for transplant but ultimately did not receive a liver transplant because their tumor progressed and exceeded transplant eligibility criteria before the transplant could be performed. Accordingly, intent-to-treat analyses of liver transplantation for HCC consistently demonstrate lower survival rates.</p><p>Ultimately, despite the demonstrated benefit of transplantation, particularly in cirrhotic patients with small tumors, the group of patients with HCC who are candidates for OLT and who actually receive a graft is very small. Worldwide, the majority of patients with early stage HCC (often detected in the setting of formal surveillance programs) are treated in the Far East and Asian countries, where OLT is not a wide-spread option because of religious beliefs, lack of living-donor transplant programs, and its prohibitive cost. Without screening (ie, in most of the West), few patients who have cirrhosis and early stage HCC are identified as candidates for OLT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOCATION OF DONOR ORGANS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shortage of donor livers has necessitated the development of allocation schema, whereby priority for donor organs is given to the most severely ill patients. In the United States, allocation of deceased donor livers for both adults and children is based upon the &quot;Model for End stage Liver Disease&quot; (MELD) score, a statistical model based upon predicted survival in patients with cirrhosis. A higher point score is assigned to patients who are estimated to have a worse short-term prognosis based upon the traditional MELD parameters of serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and international normalized ratio (INR) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-meld-and-meldna-scores-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-meld-and-meldna-scores-for-liver-transplantation-listing-purposes-not-appropriate-for-patients-under-age-12-years-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the traditional MELD criteria are of limited usefulness because the criteria were not developed to predict the risk of death among patients with chronic liver disease who also have HCC. Compared with patients suffering from cholestatic liver disease or viral hepatitis without HCC, many of these patients have minimal liver dysfunction until late in the course of the disease process. Furthermore, in some parts of the United States, the waiting period for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be as long as 24 months. For patients with HCC, prolonged waiting often results in tumor growth (which may result in disqualification from OLT) as well as progression of the underlying liver disease.</p><p>Because of this, a supplemental system for prioritization was developed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) that would provide these patients access to an allograft before their HCC progresses beyond the Milan criteria. Prioritization scores for patients with HCC are based upon tumor size and number. The American Liver Tumor Study Group (ALTSG) modification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>) of the standard tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 3</a>) from the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) is used.</p><p>Under the current UNOS policy for allocation of deceased donor livers for transplantation, patients with ALTSG stage II HCC (single HCC between 2 and 5 cm, or two to three lesions, none greater than 3 cm) who are potential OLT candidates are assigned their calculated MELD score with &quot;exception points&quot; for the fact that they have HCC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld#H16431884\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;, section on 'Hepatocellular carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>Criteria of <span class=\"nowrap\">UNOS/Organ</span> Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) regarding the exception points for patients with HCC were revised in October 2015, modifying the initial score, the maximum value, and the timing of exception scores assigned to HCC candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In January 2016, the MELD score was recalculated to incorporate serum sodium for candidates with a MELD score greater than 11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Specifically, after October 8, 2015, patients with HCC within the listing criteria are registered at their calculated MELD scores plus an &quot;exception score&quot; of 6 for the first three months and for the first three-month extension (provided that they continue to meet the criteria). At the time of the second extension (ie, a delay of six months), candidates will receive a score of 28, and additional points are subsequently awarded for longer times on the wait list, with the maximum possible score capped at 34. This revision aims to create a more balanced situation regarding the access and priority to transplantation between candidates with HCC exception points and those without HCC with allocation priority based on their MELD points.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Requirements for listing and management while on the wait list</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713421\"><span class=\"h3\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, in an attempt to ensure that preoperative assessment is as accurate as possible, UNOS provides a set of specific requirements for listing patients with HCC for OLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The patient must undergo a thorough assessment to evaluate the number and size of tumors, and to rule out extrahepatic spread <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> macrovascular involvement (ie, tumor thrombus in the portal or hepatic vein). This can be accomplished by computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plus a staging chest CT scan. Bone scan is no longer required as of December 2012.</p><p>To receive priority MELD points, the HCC must be stage T2 cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although patients with smaller or larger tumors may be listed, only those with ALTSG stage II HCC (single HCC between 2 and 5 cm, or two to three lesions, none greater than 3 cm) who are potential OLT candidates are assigned a higher priority MELD score. Of note, these MELD criteria are applicable to patients with HCC in the setting of cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Allocation of donor organs'</a> above.)</p><p>Prelisting biopsy is not mandatory. However, patients must have imaging findings that are consistent with HCC. Prior to December 2012, the UNOS allocation policy included the following vague language (&quot;candidate must have&hellip;a vascular blush corresponding to the area of suspicion on radiographic studies&quot;). However, as of December 2012, there are more specific imaging criteria for HCC diagnosis and classification, as well as minimal technical specifications for dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and MRI of the liver that must be met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Nodules found on imaging of cirrhotic livers must be classified according to the OPTN classification as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F87919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87919 \">table 4</a>). OPTN Class 5 nodules correspond to an imaging diagnosis of HCC.</p><p>Patients with class 5B and 5T nodules are eligible for automatic prioritization with a higher MELD score than the otherwise calculated score (termed the &quot;exception score&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Allocation of donor organs'</a> above.). </p><p>A single OPTN Class 5A nodule corresponds to T1 stage HCC and does not qualify for automatic priority MELD points. However, combinations of 2 or 3 class 5A nodules<strong> </strong>that meet stage T2 criteria are eligible for automatic priority. Continued documentation of the tumor is required every three months by CT or MRI to ensure continued eligibility for OLT; repeat chest CT is not required to maintain HCC priority scores.</p><p>Following implementation of the initial UNOS allocation policy in 2002, early assessment suggested that waiting times for patients with HCC to receive a deceased-donor organ decreased significantly, and that the number of patients dropping out from the waiting list because of disease progression also decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Despite this, the similar posttransplant survival rates for patients with HCC in the pre-MELD and post-MELD eras suggest the need for ongoing modifications to the system. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has also been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Living donor transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713480\"><span class=\"h3\">Outside of the United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the United States, practices are variable. As an example, the Transplantation Society of Australia and New Zealand does not use the Milan criteria, and instead, has moved to using the expanded University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria for transplant, defined as a single tumor up to 6.5 cm, or three tumors with a total tumor diameter of up to 8 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Expanded transplant criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Recommendations for liver transplantation in HCC, including assessment of candidates, criteria for listing, management of patients on the transplant waiting list, and posttransplant management, are available from a 2010 International Consensus Conference and are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83727\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83727 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Clinical practice guidelines for liver transplantation in HCC are also available from the European Association for Study of the Liver <span class=\"nowrap\">(EASL)/European</span> Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83729 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Bridging therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the lack of data from controlled clinical trials, we suggest bridging therapy for patients with HCC who are awaiting a donor liver and who have an estimated waiting time of at least six months. We generally perform immediate radiofrequency ablation (RFA), preferably when the tumor is 3 cm in size or less. Laparoscopic-assisted RFA has the advantage of improved staging, as it can identify those patients who have otherwise occult extrahepatic disease.</p><p>Others prefer chemoembolization or radioembolization, particularly if there are two or three lesions, as long as liver function is sufficiently preserved. The role of hepatic resection prior to transplantation remains uncertain, and this approach requires validation in larger studies using intent-to-treat analysis before it is adopted widely in clinical care.</p><p>The role of locoregional therapy prior to transplantation for patients whose disease meets Milan criteria and who are expected to have a short time on the wait list is uncertain, and we suggest against its use in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>These recommendations are consistent with those of a 2010 International Consensus Conference on liver transplantation for HCC, which concluded that locoregional &quot;bridging&quot; therapy may be appropriate for patients with UNOS T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>) HCC and a likely waiting time of longer than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">EASL/EORTC</span> Clinical Practice Guideline also recommends consideration for neoadjuvant locoregional therapies if the waiting list exceeds six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Updated guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) suggest some form of bridging therapy for patients listed for liver transplantation within T2 (Milan) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>) criteria to decrease disease progression and subsequent dropout from the waiting list, without regard to the estimated waiting list time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The AASLD does not recommend one form of liver-directed therapy over another for the purposes of bridging to liver transplantation. Observation with follow-up imaging is suggested over any bridging treatment for patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation who develop a T1 HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The limited availability of donor organs has provided the impetus to investigate treatment (eg, percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI], RFA, transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], stereotactic radiotherapy, radioembolization, resection) for early stage HCC in cirrhotic patients to prevent tumor progression, acting as a &quot;bridge&quot; until a suitable donor organ becomes available. The rationale for such therapy is clear, as the rate of &quot;dropout&quot; due to tumor progression while awaiting a donor organ is reported to be approximately 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. The time spent waiting for a donor organ varies throughout the country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and thus the durability of the response to a bridging therapy that is required to prevent delisting varies. However, there may also be oncologic benefits to such therapy beyond the &quot;bridge&quot; to transplant in wait-listed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In uncontrolled studies, patients who have a major local tumor response (pathologic complete response or &ge;60 percent tumor necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] after locoregional therapies such as TACE or RFA) have a better outcome after transplant. However, the benefits of bridging therapy in patients who have a short time on the waiting list remain uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Combinations of nonresective extirpative therapies may be equally efficacious. As an example, radiofrequency and&nbsp;microwave&nbsp;ablation&nbsp;in combination with transarterial chemoembolization induce equivalent histopathologic coagulation necrosis in HCC patients bridged to liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'PEI, RFA, and microwave ablation'</a> below.) It appears that </p><p>Studies comparing the dropout rates of treated and untreated patients have been difficult to interpret due to heterogeneous populations and different criteria for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/29,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,35,36</a>], and no randomized controlled trials are available. This leaves some uncertainty as to whether any of these maneuvers actually improves outcome. Nevertheless, many centers are pursuing the strategy of TACE, initial resection, or local ablation with PEI, RFA, or stereotactic radiotherapy as a bridging therapy for patients who are on the transplant waiting list.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemoembolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with TACE has been derived mostly from case series and retrospective reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/37-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-48</a>]. Although the results are somewhat inconsistent, substantial clinical benefit has been observed in some reports without a detrimental impact on posttransplantation survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/39,42-44,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,42-44,49</a>].

A 2006 systematic review concluded that there was insufficient good quality evidence to demonstrate that TACE either improved posttransplantation survival, altered posttransplantation complication rates, or impacted on-list drop out.</p><p>TACE has also been used to downstage patients with initially more advanced HCC to where they qualify for orthotopic liver transplantation under the Milan criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>]. Results are quite variable, probably in part due to differences in entry criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Rates of successful downstaging are lower in studies with more liberal eligibility criteria.

The rationale for such an approach is that liver resection, which can be performed without delay, is associated with a high recurrence rate; OLT, which has a better long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], is not easily available because grafts are scarce. A third possibility is to offer liver resection first and &quot;salvage&quot; transplantation for tumor recurrence or deteriorating liver function.</p><p>The feasibility of this strategy was shown in a prospective series of 473 patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>) who underwent resection of a solitary HCC &le;5 cm or two to three tumors, all &le;3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. With 48-month median follow-up, 67 patients recurred, and 53 (79 percent) were considered eligible for salvage OLT.</p><p>In a second retrospective analysis of patients undergoing primary OLT compared with initial resection followed by OLT for positive margins, recurrent disease, or deterioration of hepatic function, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the difficulty of the operation, postoperative course, or overall or disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>These and other data suggest that for patients with relatively preserved liver function, initial tumor resection is a reasonable strategy since it allows the majority to retain the option of salvage OLT if they subsequently fail resection or if liver function deteriorates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/63-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-69</a>]. There appears to be no increased morbidity or impaired long-term survival following a subsequent OLT.</p><p>On the other hand, high salvage rates have not been obtained by most liver transplant programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>], and not everyone agrees with this approach, particularly given the high variability in waiting times for OLT. Reported rates of &quot;transplantable recurrence&quot; range widely from 25 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/71,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,73,74</a>]. As an example, an observational series from Paris sought to assess the strategy of primary tumor resection followed by salvage OLT for HCC arising in the setting of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Compared with primary transplantation, secondary OLT after initial resection was associated with a higher operative mortality, an increased risk of recurrence, and a worse five-year overall and disease-free survival. Moreover, only one-fourth of the patients with recurrent HCC were transplantable. Thus, these results suggest that initial resection diminishes transplantability and reduces the chance of long-term survival in cirrhotics with HCC. Another important point is that, in contrast to bridging strategies such as RFA or TACE, patients do not get exception points after resection until the tumor recurs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">PEI, RFA, and microwave ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and microwave ablation have also been studied as a &quot;bridge&quot; to transplantation in patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/44,46,75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,75-77</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety of pretransplant PEI was shown in a study of 34 patients with HCC who were wait-listed for OLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

After an average of 13 months on the waiting list, only 3 of 52 patients (5.8 percent) had dropped out due to tumor progression.

The most consistent association is with tumor size.</p><p>Investigators at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) developed a prognostic scoring system (Risk Estimation of Tumor Recurrence After Transplant [RETREAT]) using data from 721 patients who met Milan criteria (single lesion &le;5 cm; up to three separate lesions, none larger than 3 cm; no evidence of gross vascular invasion; and no regional nodal or distant metastases) and were transplanted for HCC between 2002 and 2012 at three academic transplant centers; the model was validated in a separate cohort of 341 patients also meeting Milan criteria who were transplanted at a fourth academic center over the same time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

The RETREAT score was created using these three variables, with scores ranging from 0 to 5 or higher, which were highly predictive of HCC recurrence. RETREAT was able to stratify five-year post-liver transplantation recurrence risk, ranging from less than 3 percent with a score of 0 to greater than 75 percent with a score of 5 or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

The shortage of donors has imposed a delay before transplantation, and during this time, the tumor can progress and render the patients no longer a suitable candidate for transplantation. Most of these results have been based upon analysis of patients who actually received a transplant and did not include all patients with HCC who were eligible for transplant but were not transplanted because their tumor progressed beyond transplant eligibility criteria before a donor organ became available. Thus, achievement of such promising results is contingent upon a short waiting time between diagnosis and actual performance of the transplant. The role of &quot;bridging therapy&quot; for patients who are expected to have a waiting time that exceeds six months is discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Allocation of donor organs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bridging therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Another tool (the Model of Recurrence After Liver Transplantation [MoRAL] score) was initially developed using AFP, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and tumor size and was found to be prognostic for survival after liver transplantation in a validation series, mainly in individuals receiving cadaveric liver grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A subsequent modification based upon serum levels of protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II, des-gamma carboxyprothrombin) and AFP was introduced by a different group to predict tumor recurrence after living donor liver transplantation for HCC, both within and beyond the Milan criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. The MoRAL score was defined as 11 times the square root of PIVKA-II (in milli-Anson Units <span class=\"nowrap\">[mAU]/mL)</span> plus 2 times the square root of the serum AFP (in <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. Most laboratories in the United States measure des-gamma carboxyprothrombin in <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL;</span> the conversion is 1 ng = 52.6 mAU of purified des-gamma carboxyprothrombin. In both groups, a low MoRAL score (&le;314.8) was associated with significantly longer recurrence-free and overall survivals. The MoRAL score appeared to outperform the RETREAT score in both cohorts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of the underlying liver disease may prove to be a selection criterion for OLT. Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection require OLT for HCC more often than do those with HCC and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patients with HCC in the setting of HBV are more likely to be candidates for resection based upon liver function and individual tumor characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Because patients with HCV tend to have more advanced tumors at presentation and worse underlying liver disease, they have higher recurrence rates and shorter survival times after resection or OLT than those with HCC who are HBV-positive or who have alcoholic cirrhosis as the underlying risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>The original study by Mazzaferro that set the Milan criteria was essentially limited to patients with HCV. The fact that HCV is an independent predictor of poor survival has led to reconsideration of the possible &quot;restrictive nature&quot; of the Milan criteria for patients without HCV. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications for transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p>This issue was addressed in a retrospective review of 71 patients transplanted for HCC, who were divided into those with and without HCV, as well as those within and outside Milan criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The survival of patients with HCC that were HCV negative but outside Milan criteria was not statistically different from that of patients who were within Milan criteria. This study had the limitations of relatively small sample as well as being retrospective.</p><p>The issue of OLT for patients with HCC and HCV is controversial. Some clinicians support the use of OLT for such patients despite the poorer outcome, while others advocate OLT only for HCC patients with chronic HBV infection in conjunction with posttransplant antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Nonetheless, OLT for HCV-positive patients with HCC remains common nationwide. It is very likely that the &quot;landscape&quot; regarding HCV-positive patients will change significantly in the following years, given the use of newer interferon-free regimens, which are successful even in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The success of these regimens will affect the outcome of liver transplantation for these patients, as avoiding or better managing HCV recurrence after liver transplantation will significantly increase survival. Issues concerning treatment of HCV and OLT for patients with hepatitis are discussed elsewhere.

Some have postulated that higher recurrence rates after LDLT than after DDLT may reflect the fact that longer wait times for a deceased donor organ permits the dropout of those patients who are destined to have an early recurrence based upon disease biology, and therefore lower recurrence rates following DDLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/142-144\" class=\"abstract_t\">142-144</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other studies of large (although not completely homogeneous) populations suggest that although five-year recurrence rates were similar between the LDLT and DDLT groups, overall survival was significantly better with LDLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p/><p>These studies and the issues they raise stress the need for prospective direct analysis of disease recurrence, long-term survival, and dropout rates in comparable patient cohorts with HCC undergoing either DDLT or LDLT.

Most proposals are based strictly upon tumor size and number. As an example, a report from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) showed that patients selected for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) using expanded eligibility criteria (the UCSF criteria, a single hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] nodule up to 6.5 cm, or up to three lesions, the largest of which is 4.5 cm or smaller and the sum of the diameters [cumulative tumor size] no larger than 8 cm) had outcomes that were comparable to those of patients meeting the Milan criteria (single tumor &le;5 cm in size, or &le;3 tumors each &le;3 cm in size, no macrovascular invasion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].

A 2010 International Consensus Conference on liver transplantation for HCC concluded that the Milan criteria remain the benchmark for the selection of patients with HCC for transplantation, but that patients could be considered for liver transplantation outside of the Milan criteria if the dynamics of the local waiting list allow it without undue prejudice to other recipients with a better prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83727\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83727 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Downstaging through neoadjuvant locoregional therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its use as a &quot;bridging therapy&quot; to reduce the number of dropouts from the transplant list because of tumor progression, local downstaging therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), selective radioembolization with yttrium-90 labeled microspheres, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have also been used to downstage patients with initially more advanced HCC (in some cases, meeting the expanded transplant criteria) to where they qualify for priority listing under the Milan criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/50,52-54,56,159-164\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52-54,56,159-164</a>].

A systematic review of 13 studies (950 patients) concluded that the pooled success rate for downstaging was 48 percent (95% CI 39-58 percent), and that there was no significant difference between TACE and TARE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. In a separate analysis of 12 studies (320 patients) the post-liver-transplantation recurrence rate was 16 percent (95% CI 11-23 percent). Posttransplant survival could not be reliably estimated due to intrastudy heterogeneity in survival data reporting.

However, in most centers in the United States, including ours, this is not a standard approach. Automatic Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception points for OLT are not provided for tumors beyond stage II, and in most centers patients who only meet the standard United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) criteria for listing after downstaging do not automatically receive a higher priority MELD score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest the following after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging every three to six months for two years, then annually</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assay of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), if initially elevated, every three months for two years then every six months</p><p/><p>Guidelines for posttransplant management from a 2010 International Consensus Conference include contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and AFP measurements every 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Some have suggested that the posttreatment surveillance strategy be tailored according to the individual risk of posttransplantation recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110845 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, in our view, the current data derived from a retrospective analysis are insufficient to make this recommendation, and we await prospective data confirming the prognostic power of the Risk Estimation of Tumor Recurrence After Transplant (RETREAT) and Model of Recurrence After Liver Transplantation (MoRAL) scores and evaluating their application to posttreatment surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H3556104090\" class=\"local\">'Tumor-related variables'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Liver cancer (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a viable and potentially curative option for selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two options are deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT).</p><p>Overall survival and disease recurrence rates following OLT in carefully selected patients are similar or only slightly worse than survival for patients undergoing OLT for non-malignant causes. Moreover, retrospective studies that adjust for disease severity suggest that survival following OLT is as good or better as with other alternative treatments for HCC in carefully selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Survival compared with transplantation for other reasons'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Survival in comparison to other types of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with localized HCC who are candidates for surgical resection, we recommend resection rather than transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are not candidates for resection and who have a single lesion &le;5 cm, no more than three separate lesions, none larger than 3 cm, no evidence of gross vascular invasion, and no regional nodal or distant metastases, we recommend liver transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). When these criteria are strictly applied, five-year survival rates of 75 percent or higher can be achieved. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications for transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prelisting biopsy is not mandatory. However, in the United States, requirements for listing for liver transplantation from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) require that patients have imaging findings that are consistent with HCC; only class 5 nodules meet imaging criteria for listing for transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F87919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87919 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To receive priority Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) points, the HCC must be stage T2 cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although patients with smaller or larger tumors may be listed, only those with American Liver Tumor Study Group (ALTSG) stage II HCC (single HCC between 2 and 5 cm, or two to three lesions, none greater than 3 cm) who are potential OLT candidates are assigned an automatic higher priority MELD score. Of note, these MELD criteria are only applicable to patients with HCC developing in the setting of cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Allocation of donor organs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outside of the United States, International Consensus guidelines also suggest that biopsy is not necessary in cirrhotic patients who have high-quality dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that are typical for HCC, and a lesion larger than 1 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F83727\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83727 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Requirements for listing and management while on the wait list'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional requirements for listing and recommendations for management of patients on the transplant waiting list vary country to country. However, while a patient is on the waiting list for liver transplantation, continued documentation of tumor status is required every three months by CT or MRI to ensure continued eligibility for transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Requirements for listing and management while on the wait list'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of nonsurgical &quot;bridging&quot; therapy with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or chemoembolization has not been proven in controlled trials. Nevertheless, for patients who are estimated to have a waiting time of at least six months, we generally suggest immediate RFA or microwave ablation at the time of listing, preferably when the tumor is 3 cm in diameter or less, to reduce tumor size and delay progression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Others prefer chemoembolization, particularly if there are two or three lesions, as long as liver function is sufficiently preserved. The value of pre-transplantation hepatic resection remains uncertain and this approach is best considered in the context of a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bridging therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Updated guidelines for treatment of HCC from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) suggest that patients beyond the Milan criteria (&ge;T3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53242 \">table 2</a>)) can be considered for liver transplantation after successful downstaging into the Milan criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in most centers in the United States, this is not a standard approach. Automatic MELD exception points for OLT are not provided for tumors beyond stage II, and in most centers, patients who only meet the standard UNOS criteria for listing after downstaging do not automatically receive a higher priority MELD score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, centers may petition regional boards for exception points. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Downstaging through neoadjuvant locoregional therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of LDLT in patients with HCC remains controversial. However, if a suitable and willing donor is identified and the patient is otherwise eligible for transplantation, this approach is a reasonable alternative to waiting 6 to 12 months for a deceased donor graft. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Living donor transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have undergone liver transplantation for HCC, immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the risk of graft rejection is associated with a risk of tumor regrowth. As a result, every effort should be made to reduce doses to an effective minimum. There is a need for more data (in particular, randomized controlled trials) on the long-term success of sirolimus-based immunosuppression and its side effects before it can be concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> is the most appropriate immunosuppressant for patients undergoing OLT for HCC. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Degree and type of immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the concerns about efficacy, as well as the potential for early recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we recommend not administering adjuvant chemotherapy to any patient undergoing liver transplantation for HCC unless in the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following transplantation, patients should undergo periodic surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI plus serial assay of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. (See <a href=\"#H457346943\" class=\"local\">'Post transplantation surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Llovet JM, Di Bisceglie AM, Bruix J, et al.
