Dysfunction of the fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve), which innervates the superior oblique muscle, is one cause of paralytic strabismus and can result from lesions anywhere along its path between the fourth nerve nucleus in the midbrain and the superior oblique muscle within the orbit. These lesions can be congenital or acquired.</p><p>The manifestations and diagnosis of fourth nerve palsy, also known as superior oblique paralysis and trochlear nerve palsy, are reviewed here. Palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) has the longest intracranial course; it is the only cranial nerve that has a dorsal exit from the brainstem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54433 \">figure 1</a>). It begins in the midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus as fascicles extending from the fourth nerve nuclei. The trochlear nerves cross after they exit dorsally in the anterior medullary velum. The fourth nerve passes between the superior cerebellar artery and the posterior cerebral artery and runs in the subarachnoid space. It travels within the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure to innervate the superior oblique muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. </p><p>The fourth cranial nerve is a purely efferent or pure motor nerve and it innervates a single muscle, the superior oblique. The primary action of the superior oblique muscle is intorsion of the eye in the primary position; the secondary action is depression of the eye in the adducted position; a tertiary action of the muscle is abduction (especially in the abducted position) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The long course of the fourth cranial nerve renders it particularly prone to injury from blunt head trauma or compression from changes in intracranial pressure, brain tumors, or swelling anywhere along its course. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may present with fourth cranial nerve palsy at any age and in either gender. Many case series report a male predominance, presumably because of the greater incidence of trauma in young males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3385196066\"><span class=\"h2\">Fourth cranial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with fourth nerve palsies may complain of binocular (ie, present with both eyes open) vertical diplopia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subjective tilting of objects (torsional diplopia). Because the superior oblique also depresses the eye in the adducted position, objects viewed in primary position, and especially in down-gaze, may appear double (eg, when going down a flight of stairs). More mildly affected individuals may complain of blurred vision, difficulty focusing, and dizziness rather than overt diplopia. </p><p>The patient may adopt a conscious or unconscious head tilt. This is because torsional and vertical diplopia often improve with head tilting to the side opposite the paralyzed muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>). As an example, vertical and torsional diplopia in a patient with left fourth nerve palsy improve with the head tilted toward the right. Old photographs may show the long-standing compensatory contralateral head tilt in congenital or long-standing palsies. Additionally, some patients may subconsciously close one eye when reading.</p><p>On examination, an ipsilateral hypertropia (deviation upward) and excyclotorsion (rotation outward) of the involved eye is present because the superior oblique muscle intorts and depresses the eye. The upward deviation is greater when gaze is in the direction of action of the weak muscle (downgaze and contralateral horizontal gaze). The deviation is also greater in ipsilateral head tilt. Thus, a left fourth nerve palsy causes a left hypertropia, which is greater in right gaze and with the head tilted to the left. These characteristics form the basis for the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3195564612\" class=\"local\">'Unilateral fourth nerve palsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with only a small angle deviation from a unilateral superior oblique palsy can present with little or no primary position hypertropia and only head tilt test and gaze tests upon examination (ie, the three-step test). In this setting, it is important to consider the possibility of masked bilateral superior oblique palsies (the primary position deviation is obscured because the bilateral fourth nerve palsies cancel each other out). These examinations are described in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1361327141\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The direction and degree of subjective torsion can be measured objectively with a double Maddox rod. The affected eye is usually extorted because the superior oblique muscle is an intorter of the eye. (See <a href=\"#H3957807759\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of torsion'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455141470\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fourth nerve palsies may be isolated or accompanied by other contributory neurologic abnormalities. Nonisolated palsies may be divided into four syndromes based upon the topographic anatomy of the fourth nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80378\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80378 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A midbrain nuclear or fascicular lesion (eg, tumor, stroke, demyelination) is typically accompanied by other brainstem symptoms, such as hemisensory loss, hemiparesis, a central Horner syndrome, or other brainstem cranial neuropathies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions of the subarachnoid space (eg, meningitis) are typically associated with other signs and symptoms including headache, stiff neck, and other cranial nerve abnormalities. Focal lesions (aneurysms, schwannomas) may produce isolated fourth nerve palsies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cavernous sinus lesions are usually associated with other localizing signs (eg, third, fifth, or sixth nerve dysfunction, or Horner syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orbital apex lesions often involve third, fifth, and sixth cranial nerves as well as the optic nerve. Orbital involvement may also produce such signs as proptosis, chemosis, and orbital or conjunctival edema.</p><p/><p>The fourth nerve exits from the dorsum of the brainstem. Thus, neurologic signs of cerebellar disease may be present if a tumor in that region is causing the fourth nerve palsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1361327141\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fourth cranial nerve palsy should be suspected in patients with binocular vertical diplopia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subjective tilting of objects (torsional diplopia). The diagnosis can be confirmed using a three-step clinical evaluation as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195564612\"><span class=\"h2\">Unilateral fourth nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During gross ductional testing in various directions of gaze, the ocular movements can appear to be full despite weakness of the superior oblique muscle. In some cases, however, the affected eye has reduced infraduction with adduction. The Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test is performed to make the diagnosis of fourth nerve palsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F116319\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116319 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1 &ndash; Which is the higher (hypertropic) eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>)? (See panel B.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The determination of the more hypertropic eye narrows the paretic possibilities to four extraocular muscles (the ipsilateral superior oblique or inferior rectus or the contralateral inferior oblique or superior rectus) as in panel B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>). As an example, if the left eye is higher (a left hypertropia), the muscles that are potentially involved include the depressors of the left eye, the left superior oblique, and the left inferior rectus; or the elevators of the right eye, the right inferior oblique, and the right superior rectus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2 &ndash; Is the hypertropia worse in right or left gaze?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The determination of which horizontal gaze worsens the hypertropia narrows the possible muscles involved from four to two because only two muscles act in right gaze and two in left gaze. The hypertropia is worse in contralateral gaze because that movement is controlled by the paretic muscle, as in panel C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>). Thus, worsening of the hypertropia in right gaze in a patient with left hypertropia implicates either the left superior oblique or the right superior rectus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3 &ndash; Is the hypertropia worse in right or left head tilt?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The determination of which head tilt worsens the hypertropia (Bielschowsky head tilt test) identifies the involved muscle, as in panel D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>). Hyperdeviation is worse in ipsilateral head tilt in a fourth nerve palsy because the intorsion ability of the ipsilateral superior oblique is weak and is compensated for by the other ipsilateral intorter (the superior rectus). Activation of the superior rectus causes elevation of the eye and increases the hypertropia. The deviation improves in contralateral head tilt, the position that typically is adopted by the patient to reduce diplopia. Thus, left hypertropia that worsens with right gaze and left head tilt is consistent with a left superior oblique (or fourth nerve) palsy.</p><p/><p>Inconsistencies in these findings suggest that there is not an isolated fourth nerve palsy and that other diagnoses should be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F116319\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116319 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diplopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diplopia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best time to diagnose a fourth nerve palsy is early in its course. If the palsy does not resolve, there is a tendency for the deviation to become more &quot;comitant.&quot; This means the hypertropia that was once limited largely to one field of gaze will creep into the opposite field due to the contraction, and thus overaction, of the antagonistic muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Some authors advocate for a &quot;fourth step&quot; to ensure that the typical excyclotorsion of a weak superior oblique muscle is present on the affected side using double Maddox rod or fundus photography (demonstrating the ipsilateral excyclotorsion). The upright-supine test is an alternative proposed fourth step to differentiate skew deviation from other causes of vertical strabismus. (See <a href=\"#H464361138\" class=\"local\">'Ocular tilt reaction and skew deviation'</a> below.)</p><p>The exam can be limited in noncooperative patients. Therefore, if head tilt is present and the three-step test is unable to be performed, some ophthalmologists patch one eye and look for resolution of tilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2941709250\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral fourth nerve palsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral fourth nerve palsies are suggested by the following features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60504\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60504 \">picture 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternating hypertropia on horizontal gaze or head tilt (eg, right hypertropia in left gaze and left hypertropia in right gaze).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive head tilt test to either shoulder (double Bielschowsky head tilt test).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large degree of excyclotorsion (&gt;10 degrees).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V-pattern esotropia (ie, a difference of 15 prism diopters or more in esotropia between upward and downward gaze) caused by a decrease in the abducting effect of the superior oblique(s) in depression and overaction of the inferior oblique muscle(s).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underaction of both superior oblique muscles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> overaction of both inferior oblique muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relatively small hypertropia in primary position (the two eyes have a vertical deviation and tend to cancel each other out).</p><p/><p>These clinical features should be used in combination to diagnose bilateral fourth palsy.

Similar to fourth nerve palsy, skew deviation presents with hypotropia, cyclotorsion, and head tilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In skew deviation, the pattern of vertical misalignment does not follow a set pattern with gaze direction or head tilt, but may mimic a fourth nerve palsy. However, as measured by double Maddox rod, the laterality and direction of torsion in skew deviation (bilateral rather than unilateral torsion or incyclotorsion rather than excyclotorsion) are often inconsistent with superior oblique paralysis. In the uncooperative patient, a photograph of the fundus can be taken to demonstrate the torsion; in skew deviation, the fundus of the hypertropic eye is typically incyclotorted, while in fourth nerve palsy the fundus is excyclotorted. </p><p>In addition, ocular torsion and vertical misalignment are position dependent in skew deviation (decreasing with position change from upright to supine), whereas they are relatively unaffected by position in fourth nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A positive upright-supine test (vertical strabismus decreases by &ge;50 percent with position change from upright to supine) suggests skew deviation with high specificity in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Finally, skew deviation typically is accompanied by other posterior fossa signs (eg, other cranial neuropathies, hemisensory loss, or hemiparesis) and more widespread brainstem disease.

(See <a href=\"#H2941709250\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral fourth nerve palsies'</a> above.)</p><p>In most cases, MRI is unremarkable, implicating an injury to the nerve itself; however, in some patients, a dorsal midbrain contusion or hemorrhage is documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Some traumatic fourth nerve palsies improve with time, but most do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2300023365\"><span class=\"h3\">Microvascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While more commonly affecting the third and sixth cranial nerves, microvascular disease can involve the fourth cranial nerve as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/27,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,38-41</a>].

MRI may show an infarction in the tegmentum of the midbrain, affecting the fascicle of the fourth nerve. While microvascular infarction of the fourth nerve presumably also occurs, these are not demonstrable on MRI and the diagnosis is presumptive rather than confirmed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3426441553\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A minority of patients with trochlear nerve palsy have no etiologic diagnosis after evaluation (3 of 75 patients or 4 percent in one of the largest more recent series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Idiopathic fourth nerve palsies, like idiopathic third and sixth nerve palsies, often present with mild discomfort or pain over the eyebrow of the affected eye that stops shortly after the diplopia starts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/2,3,24,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,24,43,44</a>]. When asked to point to the pain, patients usually indicate an area just above the brow on the side of the muscle weakness. Rarely does the pain require medication. </p><p>The idiopathic cases may resolve in a few weeks, and some authors defer additional neuroradiologic testing until two months have passed without improvement as long as the other cranial nerves are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/5,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3306484614\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less common causes of isolated fourth nerve palsies include tumors of the brainstem or along the course of the fourth nerve (eg, schwannoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>], cavernous hemangioma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]), intracranial or meningeal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>], zoster ophthalmicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/11,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,16</a>], pituitary macroadenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], intracavernous or superior cerebellar artery aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>], and perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>Rarely, a fourth nerve palsy can be due to raised intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

Patients with a neurologically isolated fourth nerve palsy that seems clearly congenital, traumatic, or ischemic do not require neuroimaging; however, corroborative findings on neuroimaging are sometimes seen for these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H4064271006\" class=\"local\">'Congenital'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1569382732\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2300023365\" class=\"local\">'Microvascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p>MRI is superior to computed tomography (CT) scan for the evaluation of a nonisolated fourth nerve palsy. MRI is more sensitive in the detection of intracranial lesions in the posterior fossa and is not susceptible to the bone artifacts that are seen with CT scanning. CT scanning should be used in patients who require evaluation of bone or acute bleeding, or who cannot undergo an MRI. </p><p>In addition to detecting causative lesions in the midbrain, cavernous sinus, and orbit, MRI may demonstrate enhancing nerve lesions in the subarachnoid space that may represent schwannoma or focal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture may be warranted in patients who have normal imaging studies but are suspected of having a meningitic (subarachnoid space) process. (See <a href=\"#H455141470\" class=\"local\">'Associated clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>Evaluation for mimics (eg, myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, skew deviation) may be warranted depending on the clinical presentation, but typically, an isolated fourth nerve palsy is a relatively straightforward clinical diagnosis.

Patients with traumatic fourth nerve palsy, depending upon the severity of the injury to the nerve, may improve over time and often are observed for several months before being considered for treatment. If the palsy does not resolve, the tendency is for it to become comitant, making it suitable for prism therapy. Comitant deviations are those in which the distance between the double images is equal in the various gaze directions and symptoms are only slightly affected by the direction of gaze.</p><p>Prism therapy may be employed for small, comitant, long-standing deviations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A temporary press-on (Fresnel) prism of sufficient power to align the eyes is placed on the spectacle lens. Permanent prisms can be ground into the spectacle lens if the patient is happy with the result and the deviation fails to improve spontaneously. Strabismus surgery may be helpful in patients who fail prism therapy.</p><p>Patching one eye will alleviate binocular diplopia and is useful for patients who are being observed or who defer prism or surgical therapy. Patching should be employed with caution and with the assistance of an ophthalmology consultant in children in the amblyopic age range.
