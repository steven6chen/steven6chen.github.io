This collecting duct dilatation, or ectasia, is associated with the formation of both small (microscopic) and large medullary cysts that are often diffuse but do not involve the cortex.</p><p>Medullary sponge kidney (originally called Lenarduzzi-Cacchi-Ricci disease) is usually asymptomatic. The diagnosis is commonly made as an incidental finding during an imaging test performed for a different indication. Although considered benign, the associated complications of medullary sponge kidney (eg, nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infections) may rarely lead to chronic kidney disease and even renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84076586\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The changes seen in medullary sponge kidney are thought to reflect a developmental abnormality, though the underlying defect is not fully understood. The association of medullary sponge kidney with malformations affecting the kidney such as hemihypertrophy and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has led to speculation that the disorder results from a disruption of the interface between the ureteral-bud and the metanephric blastema during embryonic development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Evidence for genetic transmission of medullary sponge kidney is limited. Some patients with medullary sponge kidney have mutations in the gene for glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a protein that is pivotal in renal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One study suggested that mutations in GDNF may lead to osteogenic differentiation in renal papillary cells, resulting in medullary sponge kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this study, a patient heterozygous for a GDNF mutation and medullary sponge kidney underwent nephrectomy for a different clinical indication; cells from the papilla of the resected kidney were cultured and, after several months, developed mineralization. The investigators subsequently showed that similar mineralization occurred in an immortalized human kidney cell line when the GDNF gene was knocked down.</p><p>Although occasional families with medullary sponge kidney appear to show autosomal dominant inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>], a positive family history is often absent. Despite this, family clustering of medullary sponge kidney may be common. In a study of 50 patients with documented medullary sponge kidney, 27 had affected immediate-family members identified with imaging (either contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CT] or ultrasound) or, among deceased family members, a suggestive clinical history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Not all affected family members had a phenotype that was identical to that of the index cases. The responsible genotypes for this clustering are uncertain and were not due to mutations in GDNF.</p><p>The infrequent positive family history and a benign clinical course help distinguish medullary sponge kidney from two other diseases that are genetically transmitted and typically progressive: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease. No existing evidence suggests that medullary sponge kidney has a pathogenesis related to that of these other disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Course and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (medullary cystic kidney disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As described elsewhere, a common clinical manifestation of medullary sponge kidney is recurrent calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate stone formation (see <a href=\"#H21853656\" class=\"local\">'Kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis'</a> below). Several factors are thought to contribute to such formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affected patients often have well established urinary risk factors for calcium stone formation, such as hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, hypocitraturia, and hyperoxaluria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10-12</a>]. The frequency of these abnormalities may be higher than in stone formers without medullary sponge kidney. Hypercalciuria in patients with medullary sponge kidney may, in some patients, reflect impaired calcium reabsorption by the damaged collecting tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with medullary sponge kidney often form apatite (calcium phosphate) concretions in the cysts, which then act as a nidus for stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two potential mechanisms may contribute to this nephrocalcinosis: stasis in the ectatic collecting ducts and cysts and an increased urine pH, due to impaired local acidification in the terminal collecting duct. Although the urine pH may be appropriately acid (less than 5.3) if the number of affected nephrons with impaired acidification is relatively low, some patients with medullary sponge kidney have an incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis in which the urine pH remains above 5.3, even in the setting of an acid load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. Overt renal tubular acidosis has been described but is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of distal (type 1) and proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853625\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of this disorder is not clear, in part because patients are often diagnosed when urologic imaging is performed for a specific indication. As an example, a diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney was made in fewer than one percent of patients undergoing intravenous urographic studies for any indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Since many patients with medullary sponge kidney are asymptomatic, the true prevalence in the population is likely to be much lower.</p><p>On the other hand, the prevalence of medullary sponge kidney is much higher in certain clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12 to 20 percent of patients who recurrently form calcium stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>20 to 30 percent of recurrent calcium stone formers who are under the age of 20 or women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853633\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many, if not most, patients with medullary sponge kidney are asymptomatic. The disease either remains undiagnosed or is discovered incidentally with a radiographic study, such as a computed tomographic (CT) urogram, performed for some other indication.</p><p>When patients with medullary sponge kidney present with symptoms, the major clinical manifestations are kidney stones (which can cause flank pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria), hematuria, and urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The age at diagnosis is typically 30 to 50 years; however, the range is wide with some teenagers presenting with renal colic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853656\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of stones and nephrocalcinosis (the deposition of calcium phosphate in the kidney) in patients with medullary sponge kidney is hard to determine since most patients with this disorder go undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients being evaluated for recurrent nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"#H21853625\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The stones in medullary sponge kidney are primarily composed of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate. Carbonate apatite, a form of calcium phosphate crystallization, may also be present. In the presence of urinary tract infection with urease-producing organisms, struvite may be a component as well. As previously described, several factors are thought to contribute to stone formation in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H84076586\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853694\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematuria is another common symptom in medullary sponge kidney, and its presentation is highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It can occur in the presence or absence of stones, can be associated with nephrocalcinosis, can be microscopic or gross, and can be singular or recurrent. The bleeding is typically painless unless clots lead to ureteral obstruction or is associated with nephrolithiasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853702\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract infection also occurs with increased frequency in medullary sponge kidney, especially in women. Approximately one third of women with this disorder have two or more infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Stone formation and stasis in the cysts are probable contributing factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853710\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased concentrating ability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collecting tubule dysfunction can also lead to decreased maximum concentrating ability in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. However, the defect is usually mild and does not lead to symptomatic polyuria except for occasional nocturia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853718\"><span class=\"h2\">Diminished bone mineral density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not uniquely observed in those with medullary sponge kidney, many patients appear to have decreased bone mineral density. One uncontrolled study demonstrated that patients with medullary sponge kidney and hypercalciuria had diminished bone mineral density (BMD); 59 percent of these patients had a T score between -1.0 and -2.5 (osteopenia) and 12 percent had a T score lower than -2.5 (osteoporosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a second study, 71 percent of patients had either osteopenia or osteoporosis, and BMD improved with potassium citrate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As with other calcium stone formers with hypercalciuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], there was an inverse correlation of lower BMD with higher urine calcium excretion.</p><p>In addition to higher urine calcium excretion, two further mechanisms may contribute to decreased bone mineral density:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired acidification of the urine could result in reduced BMD, and treatment with potassium citrate is associated with improved BMD. However, impaired acidification has not been consistently demonstrated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An association between medullary sponge kidney and hyperparathyroidism has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but this association is inconsistent and not clearly related to stone formation or diminished BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5762378\"><span class=\"h2\">Flank pain in the absence of stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flank pain in the affected kidneys is often reported in the absence of an obstructing kidney stone or urinary tract infection. The basis for pain in this setting is poorly understood.</p><p>Flank pain may be acute, resembling renal colic, and may lead to emergency department visits; when imaging studies fail to demonstrate obstructing stones, hydrocalyx, or hydronephrosis, patients are frequently dismissed without receiving analgesics. Chronic pain can also occur and produce significant disability. In a minority of affected patients, this recurrent pain may become life changing and lead to chronic treatment with analgesics, including opiates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H789246051\"><span class=\"h2\">Other associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, patients manifest other clinical features that suggest a congenital disorder. As an example, hemihypertrophy, Marfan syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and nerve and skeleton abnormalities have been described in patients with medullary sponge kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534533394\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with medullary sponge kidney frequently undergo imaging of the genitourinary tract that is performed for another indication. The appearance varies based upon the modality utilized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534533515\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous pyelography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cystic dilatations in the kidneys of affected patients lead to the appearance on intravenous pyelography (IVP) of a &quot;brush,&quot; or linear striations, radiating outward from some or all of the calyces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53793\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53793 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64427\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64427 \">image 2</a>). Enlargement of the pyramids and intraductal concretions are also often seen. Calcium stones, if present, are typically small and, almost pathognomonically, occur in clusters limited to the affected calyces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50100\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50100 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F112834\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112834 \">image 4</a>). Most affected patients have bilateral involvement, but some have involvement of only one kidney or of only some calyces.</p><p>Aside from the fact that IVP is rarely performed, there are two major diagnostic difficulties with the radiographic appearance of medullary sponge kidney with an IVP. First, these findings may be absent if the examination is suboptimal. In one report, for example, only 3 of 53 studies were of satisfactory quality to visualize the pericalyceal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Stool and gas in the bowel often obscure the renal anatomy. Second, a more subtle homogeneous pre-calyceal &quot;blush&quot; may be seen on IVP. This may represent mild medullary sponge kidney in some cases, but a definitive radiologic diagnosis requires other features of this disorder such as cystic dilatations or intraductal calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney is most likely if these cystic dilatations appear 10 minutes or later after contrast injection, provided there is no urinary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534533522\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-contrast CT scan can detect medullary nephrocalcinosis, suggestive of medullary sponge kidney, but this finding is seen in other disorders associated with hypercalciuria or renal stones and tubular ectasia is not as well seen as with IVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Newer techniques such as multidetector-row CT permit the creation of high-resolution three-dimensional displays that provide both cross-sectional and IVP-like images of the contrast-filled renal collecting systems, ureters, and urinary bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51867\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51867 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534533529\"><span class=\"h2\">Other modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful if gadolinium is administered, it cannot distinguish medullary sponge kidney from autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease. Discrimination between the two disorders could only be made on clinical grounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Ultrasonography typically reveals a uniformly echogenic corticomedullary junction due to calcium deposits in the affected regions but is considered much less specific than IVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21853726\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney. Previously, the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney was made by intravenous pyelography (IVP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/5,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24-26</a>]. A definitive radiologic diagnosis is provided by the finding of cystic dilations, with pooling of radiocontrast leading to a calyceal &quot;brush&quot;-like appearance, in combination with either nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. A calyceal &quot;brush&quot; by itself, while suggestive, is not definitive, because it may be seen in 10 to 15 percent of IVPs, especially with low-osmolar contrast agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>However, these findings were most commonly noted in the past when an IVP was routinely performed for the evaluation of renal colic. The preferred modality to evaluate possible nephrolithiasis is non-contrast computed tomography (CT), which can detect medullary nephrocalcinosis but not cystic dilatations. Although suggestive of medullary sponge kidney, nephrocalcinosis is seen in other disorders associated with hypercalciuria or renal stones, and tubular ectasia is not as well seen with standard non-contrast CT as with IVP.</p><p>Thus, only characteristic findings with either an IVP or a multidetector-row CT with contrast provide a definitive diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney. However, we would <strong>not</strong> obtain either study just to establish the diagnosis, because medullary sponge kidney is usually a benign disease with no specific treatment, and failure to make the diagnosis has no adverse consequences. In addition, both IVP and multidetector-row CT are associated with a significant dose of radiation.</p><p>Although medullary sponge kidney will continue to be detected at centers where IVP is routinely employed to evaluate patients with suspected nephrolithiasis (or if multidetector-row CT is used for a separate indication such as hematuria), the widespread availability of non-contrast CT to diagnose nephrolithiasis will diminish the frequency by which medullary sponge kidney is discovered.</p><p>Occasionally, medullary sponge kidney may be diagnosed by ureteroscopy when this procedure is performed in patients with symptomatic nephrolithiasis. In one study, the renal papillae in such patients had a distinctive &quot;billowy&quot; appearance with yellow and white plaque, with small ductal stones and mineralized plugs in the inner medullary collecting ducts and ducts of Bellini [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Proteomic studies have identified laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA-2) as a potential urinary biomarker for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a study that analyzed the urine proteome of 22 patients with medullary sponge kidney disease and 22 control patients with idiopathic calcium nephrolithiasis, the protein LAMA-2 correlated best with the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney disease. Additional studies are required to validate these initial findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534533714\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient presenting with characteristic findings on an IVP or multidetector-row CT, the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney can be made with reasonable confidence. Although patients with autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease may have similar findings, these patients have reduced glomerular filtration rate and generally do not have stones or nephrocalcinosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-tubulointerstitial-kidney-disease-medullary-cystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (medullary cystic kidney disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, patients with medullary sponge kidney will more commonly present with nephrocalcinosis detected as an incidental finding by an alternate imaging study, such as ultrasound. The differential diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis is broad, and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrocalcinosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrocalcinosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with medullary sponge kidney may also present with calcium nephrolithiasis or hematuria.

The plasma creatinine concentration remains normal in most cases. However, stone-induced episodes of obstruction can lead to transient reductions in the glomerular filtration rate, and numerous episodes of obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent infection can occasionally lead to end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>To aid in identifying patients at greatest risk for complications, a grading system for medullary sponge kidney has been proposed based upon a single cohort of 29 patients from one institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &minus; one calyx in one kidney affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 &minus; one calyx affected bilaterally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 &minus; more than one calyx affected in one kidney</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 4 &minus; more than one calyx affected bilaterally</p><p/><p>In this cohort, higher grades were associated with more symptomatic stone episodes, more hospitalizations, and more urological interventions. This grading system has not been validated or reproduced outside of the original institution or in a larger group of patients.</p><p>Treatment is indicated only for urinary tract infection (using appropriate antimicrobial therapy) and for recurrent stone formation. Treatment of calcium stones in patients with medullary sponge kidney, as it does in patients with idiopathic calcium stones, varies according to the specific underlying metabolic abnormality demonstrated by 24-hour urine collections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In an uncontrolled, retrospective study of 97 patients with medullary sponge kidney, the predominant risk factors for nephrolithiasis were hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Potassium citrate therapy (mean dose of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day)</span> for an average of 6.5 years was associated with a reduction in stone formation rate from 0.58 stones per patient per year to 0.10 stones per patient per year.</p><p>As noted above, some patients with medullary sponge kidney have flank pain in the absence of obstructing renal calculi (see <a href=\"#H5762378\" class=\"local\">'Flank pain in the absence of stones'</a> above). In such patients, low-quality data suggest that ureteroscopic holmium laser papillotomy, in which the papillary urothelium overlying cystic dilations and ductal calcifications is vaporized, may produce durable pain relief in a substantial proportion of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-sponge-kidney/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Some patients may experience pain relief only with long-term use of opiates. Other ablative therapies for chronic flank pain, such as renal denervation, have not been specifically studied in patients with medullary sponge kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256949450\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84076897\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medullary sponge kidney is a relatively common congenital disorder that is characterized by malformation of the terminal collecting ducts in the pericalyceal region of the renal pyramids. (See <a href=\"#H21853595\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The changes seen in medullary sponge kidney are thought to reflect a developmental abnormality, though the underlying defect is not known. Although occasionally familial, there is little evidence for genetic transmission of medullary sponge kidney, and there are no known responsible genes, other than the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene in a small number of cases. (See <a href=\"#H84076586\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The true prevalence of medullary sponge kidney is likely less than one percent in the population, but is much more common in patients with recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis, particularly those under the age of 20 years and women. (See <a href=\"#H21853625\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many, if not most, patients with medullary sponge kidney are asymptomatic. When patients with medullary sponge kidney do present with symptoms, the major clinical manifestations are kidney stones (which can cause flank pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria), hematuria, and urinary tract infections. In addition, flank pain may develop in the absence of an obstructing stone or urinary tract infection. (See <a href=\"#H21853633\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with medullary sponge kidney often have well established urinary risk factors for calcium stone formation, such as hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, hypocitraturia, and hyperoxaluria. In addition, apatite (calcium phosphate) concretions form in the cysts, which then act as a nidus for stone formation. (See <a href=\"#H21853656\" class=\"local\">'Kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria can occur in the presence or absence of stones, can be associated with nephrocalcinosis, can be microscopic or gross, and can occur once or many times. (See <a href=\"#H21853694\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection also occurs with increased frequency in medullary sponge kidney, especially in women. (See <a href=\"#H21853702\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medullary sponge kidney usually remains undiagnosed or is discovered incidentally with a radiographic study, such as an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or computed tomographic (CT) urogram, performed for some other indication. (See <a href=\"#H21853726\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney can most readily be made by IVP. However, because it has largely been supplanted by non-contrast CT for diagnosis and management of renal colic, IVP is uncommonly performed. (See <a href=\"#H21853726\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medullary sponge kidney has an excellent long-term prognosis. The plasma creatinine concentration remains normal in most cases. However, stone-induced episodes of obstruction can lead to acute kidney injury, and numerous episodes of obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent infection can occasionally lead to chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H21853815\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is indicated only for urinary tract infection (using appropriate antimicrobial therapy) and for recurrent stone formation. (See <a href=\"#H21853815\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Hildebrandt F, Sayer JA, Jungers P, et al.
