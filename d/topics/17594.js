Because surgical excision of truncal, extremity, or small facial BCCs on the head or neck with 4 to 5 mm margins has been associated with five-year cure rates exceeding 95 percent, 4 mm surgical margins are commonly used for the excision of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>However, the results of a 2010 meta-analysis of 89 studies on conventionally excised BCCs that excluded studies of previously excised or irradiated lesions and data on morpheaform BCCs (all features associated with increased risk for tumor recurrence) suggest that 3 mm surgical margins may be only slightly less efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Rates of pathologically confirmed complete excisions were similar for surgical margins between 3 and 5 mm, and mean recurrence rates for BCCs excised with 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, and 2 mm surgical margins were 0.4, 1.6, 2.6, and 4 percent, respectively.</p><p>The efficacy of conventional excision is less consistent in the management of BCCs at greater risk for recurrence.

Excision is typically performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia and is usually well tolerated. The long-term cosmetic and functional results are usually superior compared with radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence#H12329838\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of basal cell carcinomas at high risk for recurrence&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The surgical defect typically is immediately repaired either by side-side closure or the use of adjacent tissue flaps, skin grafts, or, more rarely, distant tissue flaps. This allows wound healing to be completed within one to two weeks. If primary closure is not possible, healing can take place by secondary intention. The type of closure depends upon several factors including the size, depth, and location of the defect; the availability and laxity of nearby tissue; and patient and clinician preference.</p><p>Disadvantages of surgical excision include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical excision is invasive and variable amounts of normal, uninvolved tissue must be sacrificed to achieve acceptable cure rates. In some anatomic areas, functional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic deficits may be produced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin grafts or flaps are frequently needed for larger lesions, and operative time is longer than that required for other procedures (such as cryosurgery and electrosurgery), particularly if a complicated reconstruction is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical excision is more expensive than cryosurgery or ED&amp;C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lesions at higher risk for recurrence, surgical excision offers inferior cure rates compared with Mohs micrographic excision.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20395993\"><span class=\"h2\">Mohs surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mohs micrographic surgery (Mohs surgery) is a specialized surgical technique that optimizes control of the tumor margins while minimizing the amount of normal tissue that must be resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This procedure allows for histologic evaluation of 100 percent of the peripheral margin at the time of the surgical procedure. Mohs surgery is usually reserved for lesions that exhibit features associated with an elevated risk for recurrence and for situations in which tissue sparing is of great value due to cosmetic or functional concerns, regardless of tumor size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One randomized trial compared standard surgical excision with Mohs surgery for the treatment of 408 primary and 204 recurrent facial BCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of the primary BCCs, five (3 percent) recurred after standard excision compared with three (2 percent) after Mohs surgery during 30 months of follow-up. Two extended follow-up studies of the same cohort found 5- and 10-year recurrence rates of 4 and 12 percent in the standard-excision group, and 2.5 and 4.4 percent in the Mohs surgery group, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. In a large Australian series of 560 (340 &lt;1 cm) primary periocular BCCs treated with Mohs surgery, the five-year recurrence rate was 0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Mohs surgery is <strong>not</strong> indicated for small primary BCCs on the trunk or extremities that lack aggressive clinical or histopathologic features, because other procedures have similar efficacy and are less time consuming and less costly.

BCCs that lack aggressive clinical or pathologic features are less likely to recur than lesions with more aggressive features. Overly aggressive management of BCCs at low risk for recurrence may result in unnecessary inconveniences to the patient and increased cost to the medical system. Conversely, inadequate treatment of lesions with aggressive features can lead to subsequent tumor recurrence with potentially devastating consequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68274%7EDERM%2F81632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68274 graphicRef81632 \">picture 2A-B</a>).</p><p>Patient-specific factors also play an important role in treatment selection.

Periodic evaluation for local recurrence should include not only visual inspection but also palpation of the skin and adjacent structures to determine the presence of deeper recurrences. Patients should be asked about any visible, textural, or sensory changes of the treated area and any suspicious or questionable areas confirmed histologically with a biopsy. For suspected deeper recurrences, one or more punch biopsies should be obtained.</p><p>Dermoscopy may improve the sensitivity of clinical diagnosis of residual or recurrent disease. In one study, 56 patients with 98 superficial BCCs treated with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> or photodynamic therapy were followed up with clinical and dermoscopic examination at 3 and 12 months posttreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-basal-cell-carcinoma-at-low-risk-of-recurrence/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Although the impact of sun avoidance in decreasing the risk of further BCCs is unclear, it seems prudent to advocate moderate sun avoidance in patients with a history of skin cancer, especially in fairer-skinned patients. These recommendations generally include sun avoidance during peak hours (10 AM and 4 PM), use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen (both ultraviolet A [UVA] and ultraviolet B [UVB]); wearing sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, and a broad-brimmed hat, avoiding sun bathing and tanning salons; and practicing routine self-skin examinations monthly.

Excised tissue should be sent for pathologic assessment for tumor margins. Mohs surgery, a specialized surgical technique that optimizes control of the tumor margins while minimizing the amount of normal tissue that must be resected, is usually reserved for tumors at high risk of recurrence and for situations in which tissue sparing is of great value due to cosmetic or functional concerns.
