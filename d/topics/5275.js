Global cancer statistics show that breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 23 percent of total cancer cases and 14 percent of cancer deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries. </p><p>Despite increasing incidence rates, annual mortality rates from breast cancer have decreased over the last decade (1.9 percent per year from 2008 to 2012) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The decline has been more pronounced in Caucasian than in African-American women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A significant portion of the decline in mortality is attributable to the impact of screening mammography, which permits diagnosis at an earlier stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Preinvasive breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) now accounts for 25 to 30 percent of all newly diagnosed, mammographically detected breast cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H556311124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Mammographic screening'</a>.) </p><p>The majority of breast cancers are diagnosed as a result of an abnormal mammogram, but not all mammographic findings represent cancer. Women who have an abnormal screening mammogram often need further diagnostic evaluation with additional mammographic views such as spot-compression magnification views or spot tomosynthesis views <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> targeted ultrasonography to determine the need for tissue sampling or biopsy. Additionally, not all cancers are detectable on mammography. A clinically suspicious mass should also be biopsied, regardless of imaging findings, as approximately 15 percent of such lesions can be mammographically occult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The goal of the initial biopsy is to obtain sufficient diagnostic material using the least invasive approach and to avoid surgical excision of benign lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This review will discuss the diagnostic evaluation and management of a woman with suspected breast cancer due to either abnormal imaging or physical findings. Initial staging workup of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, the general approach to evaluation of breast masses in women, and breast biopsy techniques are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A suspicion of breast cancer requires that care be coordinated among clinicians in several specialties. An integrated approach with breast imagers and breast surgeons can minimize unnecessary biopsies and expedite diagnosis for the woman who receives a diagnosis of breast cancer. Similarly, once the diagnosis of cancer is made, multidisciplinary coordination among breast and reconstructive surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists facilitates treatment planning and streamlines patient care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MAMMOGRAMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of breast cancers are associated with abnormal mammographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP), fewer than 10 percent of cancers were detected solely by physical examination and over 90 percent were identified mammographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>If an abnormality is found at mammographic screening, supplemental mammographic views and possibly ultrasound should be used for further characterization. A variety of mammographic techniques, including spot compression and magnification views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74424\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74424 \">image 1</a>) and varied angled views, may characterize a lesion more precisely prior to making a final recommendation for management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Some of the most aggressive cancers appear between normal screening mammograms and are therefore termed interval cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Younger women may present with large tumors prior to the age at which screening is usually recommended. Accordingly, when women present with a suspicious new mass, diagnostic mammograms should be part of the initial workup, despite young age or the patient having had a negative routine screening mammogram.</p><p>Diagnostic mammography is associated with higher abnormal interpretation rate and higher cancer detection rate as compared with screening mammography. Data on digital mammography from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) showed an abnormal interpretation rate (AIR) of 12.6 percent for diagnostic mammography and cancer detection rate (CDR) of 34.7 per 1000 compared with AIR of 11.6 percent and CDR of 5.1 for screening mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Such results are expected since diagnostic patients have signs or symptoms of breast cancer while screening patients are asymptomatic. </p><p>Screening mammography is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-breast-cancer-strategies-and-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">BI-RADS assessment categories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiologist summarizes the mammographic findings using the American College of Radiology (ACR) BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) final diagnostic assessment categories, which indicate the relative likelihood of a normal, benign, or malignant diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The BI-RADS final assessment categories standardize both the reporting of mammographic findings and the recommendations for further management (ie, routine screening, short-interval follow-up, or biopsy). Assessments are either incomplete (category 0) or one of the final assessment categories (categories 1 through 6) as described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>If a mammogram is assigned category 0, additional evaluation is required for further characterization, which may include additional mammographic views and or ultrasound and, rarely, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A BI-RADS designation of 4c or 5 should alert the pathologist that a malignant diagnosis is strongly suspected and that further evaluation of the specimen (and possible rebiopsy) is needed if the biopsy is initially interpreted as benign. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;, section on 'The BI-RADS categories'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mammographic features of breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two general categories of mammographic findings suggestive of a breast cancer: soft tissue masses and suspicious microcalcifications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Soft tissue mass/architectural distortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most specific mammographic feature of malignancy is a spiculated soft tissue mass; nearly 90 percent of these lesions represent invasive cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57593\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57593 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>Approximately one-third of noncalcified cancers appear as spiculated masses; 25 percent as irregularly outlined masses; 25 percent as less specific round, oval, or lobulated masses; less than 10 percent as well-defined round, oval, or lobulated masses; and 5 percent as areas of architectural distortion of dense tissue without an obvious mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Solid masses identified by ultrasound that are oval and circumscribed with benign imaging features have been shown to have a less than 2 percent likelihood of malignancy, and short-term (six months) follow-up and then periodic surveillance may be appropriate management in lieu of biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Microcalcifications are seen in approximately 60 percent of cancers detected mammographically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75424%7EONC%2F66876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75424 graphicRef66876 \">image 3A-B</a>). Histologically, these represent intraductal calcifications in areas of necrotic tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77048\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77048 \">picture 1</a>) or calcifications within mucin-secreting tumors such as the cribriform or micropapillary subtype of intraductal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Linear branching microcalcifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75424%7EONC%2F66876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75424 graphicRef66876 \">image 3A-B</a>), most commonly associated with the comedo histologic subtype, have a higher predictive value for malignancy than do coarse heterogeneous (ie, nonlinear irregular calcifications of varying size and shape) microcalcifications, particularly for high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, breast cancers, including DCIS, more often present with the granular type of calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Calcifications that are not suspicious for malignancy and considered benign include vascular and skin calcifications, rim calcifications, large and coarse calcifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65088\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65088 \">image 4</a>), and smooth round or oval calcifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52281\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52281 \">image 5</a>). </p><p>Despite the association of microcalcifications with DCIS, mammographic appearance alone cannot differentiate between purely intraductal and invasive ductal breast cancers; there is no mammographic correlate of basement membrane invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of invasive cancers diagnosed by mammography present only as microcalcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One-third of invasive carcinomas are associated with microcalcifications, with or without a soft tissue mass, and 10 percent of intraductal cancers present as a soft tissue mass without microcalcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H100033227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Mammography'</a>.)</p><p>Mammographic findings such as masses and calcifications can be stratified by suspicion for malignancy, and the BI-RADS 4a, 4b, and 4c categories are helpful in alerting the referring physicians, the pathologists, and surgeons to the underlying risk of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. Grouped coarse heterogeneous calcifications have a likelihood of malignancy of just under 15 percent, while amorphous calcifications have a likelihood of malignancy of 20 percent. Both would be assessed as BI-RADS 4b (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Grouped round and punctate calcifications at baseline have a probability of malignancy of less than 2 percent and can be safely placed in a short-interval (six-month) follow-up category as BI-RADS 3: Probably Benign. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'BI-RADS assessment categories'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing the extent of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammographic assessment of the extent of DCIS and early invasive carcinoma begins during diagnostic mammography and continues through the biopsy, specimen management, and the postexcision mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mammography of both breasts is particularly important in the patient with DCIS or invasive cancer who is considering breast conservation. Preoperative diagnostic mammography can help to define the extent of disease and may identify multifocal or multicentric cancer that could preclude breast conservation or signal a potential difficulty in achieving clear surgical margins. Multifocal disease is usually defined as involvement of several areas within a breast quadrant, probably representing disease along an entire duct. In contrast, multicentric disease involves multiple areas within different quadrants, probably representing involvement of multiple ducts.</p><p>Although the extent of mammographic nonlinear branching microcalcifications frequently underestimates the pathologic extent of the malignancy, the discrepancy is less than 2 cm in 80 to 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Several groups of microcalcifications separated by normal-appearing tissue should not be interpreted as multifocal or multicentric disease. Often, these represent areas of contiguous tumor that is only partially calcified within a ductal-lobule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As well, multiple groups of calcifications that are separated by normal breast tissue should be confirmed to be malignant before using the information as a basis for what to resect if it would change the surgical approach. </p><p>The combination of a mass and associated calcifications often indicates the presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC). EIC is defined pathologically as DCIS found adjacent to an invasive carcinoma, accounting for more than 25 percent of the volume of disease. This finding can be a predictor for more widespread residual tumor (usually DCIS) following gross excision of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Extensive intraductal component (EIC)'</a>.)</p><p>Postoperative mammograms to look for residual calcifications after surgical resection should be performed when the microcalcifications are not clearly or completely documented on the specimen radiograph or when margins are close or positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. If a re-excision is to be recommended on the basis of residual calcifications, care should be taken to ensure that the calcifications are associated with malignancy on histopathology and not benign tissue. Multifocal disease is not necessarily a contraindication to breast conservation but is one of the factors that should be taken into consideration along with breast size relative to the extent of disease on imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A significant limitation of mammographic assessment of disease extent is the obscuring of the borders or extent of the primary tumor by dense overlying tissue. Dense breasts can limit the sensitivity of mammography both for detection of breast cancers and for delineating disease extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In this setting, contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may complement mammographic staging. If the clinical extent of disease is larger than what can be appreciated by mammography, MRI may be considered. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Breast MRI'</a> below.)</p><p>Mammographic assessment of tumor size for the staging of multifocal disease presents a unique dilemma. Most staging classifications require that the largest tumor mass be utilized for T staging, even in cases where multifocal disease is suspected. However, others suggest that the total surface area, volume, or aggregate measurements are a better indicator of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Accurate delineation of the extent of odd-shaped, irregular, or multifocal tumors is important for treatment planning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For invasive cancers that are contiguous to the chest wall and not completely included on mammographic projections, ancillary imaging techniques such as MRI may be necessary to assess posterior tumor extension and pectoralis fascia or muscle involvement if that will determine a change in surgical approach or the use of neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Benign nodes can often be distinguished from metastatic or infiltrated intramammary lymph nodes by their mammographic or sonographic appearance, but definitive assessment often requires histopathologic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The presence of intramammary lymph node metastases appears to confer a worse prognosis, both in women who otherwise have stage I breast cancer based upon tumor size and axillary nodal status and in those with stage II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Isolated intramammary lymph node metastases are considered to represent stage II disease, even if the axillary nodes are uninvolved.

Breast US can help to characterize solid masses as either benign or malignant. In one report, the sensitivity of US for malignancy was 98.4 percent and the negative predictive value 99.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Similar findings have been noted in subsequent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, US is highly operator dependent, and significant variability in the ability of radiologists to characterize solid breast lesions by US has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. A benign solid appearance on US should <strong>not</strong> be used to avoid biopsy of a mammographically or clinically suspicious mass.

Indeterminate cysts can be aspirated under US guidance. The presence of an intracystic mass should prompt a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of the mass. Fluid from aspiration of simple cysts or from therapeutic cyst aspirations should not be sent for cytology unless frankly bloody because of the very low diagnostic yield, expected benign result, and associated cost.

For patients who present with large or locally advanced tumors for which neoadjuvant (induction) chemotherapy is considered, careful anatomic localization is critical to ensure that the surgeon can localize the area of tumor after neoadjuvant therapy.

Diagnostic algorithms are helpful as general guidelines, but they must be adapted to include patient preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Mammographic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65978\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65978 \">algorithm 1</a>) describes an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of a mammographic abnormality, which integrates BI-RADS assessment categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100197\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100197 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with palpable masses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Algorithms for clinical and imaging evaluation of palpable masses are stratified by the age of the woman. Even in the setting of palpable masses, image guidance may improve diagnostic accuracy. A clinically suspicious mass should be biopsied regardless of imaging findings, as 10 to 15 percent of such lesions can be mammographically occult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Younger women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach to the evaluation of palpable masses in younger women differs among experts.</p><p>The approach that is advocated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is an initial breast ultrasound (US) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54674 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80301\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80301 \">algorithm 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. If the examination is indeterminate or suspicious, mammography is often performed, although its utility in young women with breast masses or nodularity is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>], and a biopsy is probably warranted even if the mammogram is negative. If the mass cannot be visualized by US, mammography may be considered, or alternatively, a tissue biopsy or period of observation may be appropriate depending upon the level of clinical suspicion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, aspiration can be selected as an initial approach to a breast mass in a younger woman (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54674 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. If no fluid is aspirated and cytologic review of cell blocks from the needle washings are nondiagnostic, then US is performed. If the capacity to perform or interpret FNA is limited at an institution, this approach is not optimal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the initial evaluation shows cancer, bilateral breast imaging should be performed promptly and prior to any definitive surgery to exclude unsuspected or more extensive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Older women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a palpable mass is appreciated, bilateral diagnostic mammography should be performed prior to biopsy, even if the mass is clinically suspicious for cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80301\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80301 \">algorithm 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74666\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74666 \">algorithm 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy may alter both mammographic or US appearance. The goal of imaging in this setting is not to establish a diagnosis of cancer but rather to identify other suspicious areas or calcifications in either breast that might impact treatment. This evaluation should be performed prior to percutaneous biopsy, so that biopsy of additional suspicious lesions can be undertaken at one time. If the lesion is large and breast conservation is not an option, this is less important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H969399129\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the patient with a suspicious mammographic abnormality or palpable breast mass, the obligatory diagnostic technique is biopsy. Surgical biopsy should not be utilized as a diagnostic tool unless percutaneous palpation-guided or image-guided biopsy is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>]. A preoperative histologic diagnosis of invasive carcinoma may allow the surgeon to plan a single operation to treat the cancer, including sentinel lymph node biopsy or full axillary dissection, depending upon the clinical circumstances. Excision of more extensive areas of DCIS may also be optimally planned if the diagnosis has been established by percutaneous core needle biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note that a needle biopsy may cause hematoma and inflammation at the site of the mass and enlargement of the axillary nodes, which can make clinical assessment and surgical planning more difficult. Physical exam changes from needle biopsy often resolve by the time of surgery. If the palpable lesion is small or subtle, it is helpful to arrange wire localization of the clip placed at the time of biopsy to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of breast cancers are diagnosed as a result of an abnormal mammogram, but the majority of mammographic findings represent benign tissue.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'BI-RADS assessment categories'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While intervention is recommended for all BI-RADS category 4 lesions, the probability of malignancy can be stratified as low, moderate, or high in subclassifications of BI-RADS 4 as 4a, b, or c. The use of these subclassifications provides a useful estimate of the risk that a suspicious lesion will prove to be malignant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound (US) examination of the breast is an important diagnostic adjunct to mammography and is used to differentiate between solid and cystic masses and to provide guidance for interventional procedures.

Although advocates of MRI cite as potential benefits improved selection of patients for breast-conserving surgery, a decrease in the number of surgical procedures needed to obtain clear margins, and the synchronous detection of contralateral cancers, there are no data from prospective randomized trials that demonstrate improved outcomes from the addition of breast MRI to the diagnostic evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer. The use of breast MRI carries a risk of false positive biopsies and may delay definitive treatment and result in overtreatment. As a result, breast MRI is not recommended as a routine component of the diagnostic evaluation of breast cancer for most women.
