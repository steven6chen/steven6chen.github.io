Aging is characterized by progressive and broadly predictable changes that are associated with increased susceptibility to many diseases. Aging is not a homogenous process. Rather, organs in the same person age at different rates influenced by multiple factors, including genetic make-up, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures. A Danish twin study found that genetics accounted for about 25 percent of the variation in longevity among twins, and environmental factors accounted for about 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, with greater longevity (to age 90 or 100), genetic influences became more important.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of normal aging. Effects of aging on the immune systems and abnormal aging are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810845\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE-ASSOCIATED PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178571021\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic rhythms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organization of rhythmic physiologic processes is altered by aging. Age impacts the circadian pattern of body temperature, plasma cortisol, and sleep and can cause desynchronization or &quot;internal phase drift.&quot; Phase advances can lead to the occurrence of some rhythmic functions (eg, the 24-hour body temperature trough and sleep onset) one to two hours earlier in older adults. The pulsatile secretion of gonadotropins, growth hormone, thyrotropin, melatonin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are attenuated with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One source of this dysfunction appears to be neuronal loss in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, age may delay the ability to reset physiologic rhythms to a new photoperiod.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97310021\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of complexity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of complexity, a concept derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics, may be a general principle of all aging systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This loss of complexity may result in decreased heart-rate variability, blood-pressure variability, electroencephalographic frequencies, response to auditory frequencies, and response to stress. Age-related loss of complexity may not be immutable, however; as an example, senior athletes show greater heart rate variability than sedentary age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810854\"><span class=\"h2\">Homeostenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homeostenosis refers to the concept that, from maturity to senescence, diminishing physiologic reserves are available to meet challenges to homeostasis. This concept was first recognized by Walter Cannon in the 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Homeostenosis leads to the increased vulnerability to disease that occurs with aging.</p><p>A figure graphically displays the traditional thinking about homeostenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58907 \">figure 1</a>). The endpoint of this process is frailty, where even the smallest challenge overwhelms the available reserves and results in disaster. The &quot;precipice&quot; may be variably defined: death, cardiac arrest, hospital admission, or onset of a symptom such as confusion or incontinence. Aging itself brings the individual closer to the precipice by the loss of physiologic reserves. With aging, the area in which the older person can bring themselves back to homeostasis by invoking their reserves narrows or becomes stenotic.</p><p>Evidence for this model is plentiful. As an example, the APACHE severity of illness scales, used to predict prognosis for patients in intensive care, have a correction for age. The Acute Physiologic Assessment, a component of the APACHE score, indicates deviation from homeostatic values for 12 variables, including vital signs, oxygenation, pH, electrolytes, hematocrit, white blood count, and creatinine. A zero score indicates homeostasis, and a greater point total indicates a larger deviation from homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a comparison of young and old patients who had a cardiac arrest, the younger group (mean age 59) had significantly higher Acute Physiologic Assessment scores in the 24 hours pre-arrest than the older group (mean age 75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These data indicate that the deviation from homeostasis needed to cross a critical threshold (cardiac arrest) is less in the old. In practical terms, the creators of the APACHE scales recognize this by giving &quot;age points&quot; so that total scores are equalized between the groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit&quot;, section on 'Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)'</a>.)</p><p>Maintaining homeostasis is a dynamic, active process. Frailty is the state when physiologic reserves are maximally invoked just to maintain homeostasis and any challenge will cross some threshold. Increased severity of illness and frailty have independent effects on patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The &quot;family of precipices&quot; concept is useful in understanding altered presentations of disease in older adults. As an example, delirium is a common presentation of a wide variety of illness in the older individual, a marker of the uneasy truce that the old brain maintains with the environment. A given older person may have the same presentation (confusion) for a urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, or a myocardial infarction. The systemic responses to these differing illnesses may be similar, involving catecholamines and mediators of inflammation. The &quot;anti-confusion reserves&quot; are exhausted so the distance from homeostasis to this &quot;precipice&quot; is easily crossed.</p><p>In summary, an apparent loss of physiologic reserves in older adults leads to intolerance to challenges to their homeostasis. This increased vulnerability is in part because the older person is continually expending reserves to compensate for primary age changes, as well as other processes that are absent or trivial in the younger individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810861\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of additional challenges, the hematopoietic system maintains adequate function throughout an individual's lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Red cell life span, iron turnover, and blood volume are unchanged with age. However, bone marrow mass decreases and fat in the bone marrow increases with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Therefore, functional reserves are reduced with age. Thus, advanced age may be an important consideration for determining suitability as a donor for hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or tolerance of chemotherapy.</p><p>The compensatory hematopoietic response to phlebotomy, hypoxia, and other challenges is delayed and less vigorous in the healthy older person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is due to changes in both populations of progenitor cells and the bone marrow environmental matrix. When young mice are transfused with a cellular mixture of marrow from older and younger mice, the young marrow assumes the bulk of the repopulation burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Studies comparing the bone marrow of healthy older and younger patients found a 35 percent decrease in the colony size of the stimulated erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E) in older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Another study suggests that inability to produce critical stimulatory hormones (stem cell factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], and interleukin [IL]-3) is the major factor accounting for functional difference between bone marrow from older and younger people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The presence of abnormalities both intrinsic to older progenitor cells, as well as the milieu, is consistent with findings from a study that progenitor cells isolated from young animals demonstrated a decreased ability to repopulate bone marrow in old animals, while cells from old animals had a decreased ability to repopulate young animals; the donor age effect was about equal in magnitude to the host age-effect and the worst yield was when old marrow was given to an old host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Total circulating white cells counts do not change with age in healthy older people, but the function of several cell types is reduced. Analysis of circulating white cells reveal a greater propensity for clonal expansion with increasing age and this correlates with increased likelihood of development of hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Age-related changes in the immune system are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H23811008\" class=\"local\">'Immune system'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Age is a significant risk factor for myelotoxicity due to chemotherapy regimens for malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, consistent with many other changes, heightened sensitivity to chemotherapy and impaired recovery of the bone marrow is not a uniform finding in all older adults. This underscores the importance of heterogeneity among older people in their functional status as well as their homeostatic reserves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Though the number of platelets is unchanged with age, platelet responsiveness to a number of thrombotic stimulators is increased. Reduced availability of nitric oxide and increased oxidative damage have been implicated in age-associated platelet hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This results in a small but consistent decrease in bleeding time with age. Old age should be considered a procoagulant state. Fibrinogen, factor V, factor VII, factor VIII, factor IX, high molecular-weight kininogen, and prekallikrein increase with age in healthy humans, possibly related to the low-grade inflammation that is part of normal aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fibrin degradation fragments (D-dimers) are elevated twofold in healthy older subjects with no evidence of thrombosis and may be even higher in hospitalized older adults, such that an age-incorporating formula for D-dimer interpretation has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis, increases dramatically with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Overall, age is an important risk factor for deep venous thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810868\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall effects of aging on the gastrointestinal system are modest; aging itself does not cause malnourishment. Nonetheless, age-related changes in gastrointestinal systems affect the incidence and presentation of multiple gastrointestinal problems in older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810875\"><span class=\"h2\">Oropharynx</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epithelial lining of the oral mucosa thins with age. The gums recede, exposing the tooth cementum, which is more prone to decay, and predisposing older persons to root caries and incomplete mastication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Edentate patients are at greater risk for inadequate nutritional intake compared with those with partial or full retention of their teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Modest age-associated changes occur in the salivary glands, including a small decrease in the number of acinar cells and up to a 50 percent decrease in maximal saliva production from parotid salivary glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], although accessory salivary gland production is unchanged. Up to 50 percent of older patients have subjective complaints of dry mouth, which can impact chewing and swallowing. However, some of these complaints may be attributed to medication side-effects rather than aging itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Transfer of the food bolus to the pharynx is altered in the majority of older patients. Loss of esophageal muscle compliance results in increased resistance to flow across the upper esophageal sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Up to 60 percent of older patients without dysphagia have abnormal transfer to the pharynx on videofluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Less effective mastication and decreased food clearance from the pharynx lead to increased aspiration risk in older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810882\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic changes in the esophagus include hypertrophy of the skeletal muscle at the upper third, decrease in myenteric ganglion cells that coordinate peristalsis, and perhaps increased smooth muscle thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The amplitude of esophageal contractions during peristalsis decreases, but the movement of food is not impaired. Abnormal peristalsis after swallowing and non-peristaltic repetitive contractions, at one time attributed to old age and called &quot;presbyesophagus,&quot; are now thought to be due to disease processes.</p><p>Secondary esophageal contractions (induced by esophageal distention) appear to be greatly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Secondary contractions contribute to clearance of refluxed acid. Diminution of these contractions, combined with decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone, results in increased gastric acid exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Sensation of distention, and possibly tissue damage, in the distal esophagus is also impaired with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, many older patients with severe reflux esophagitis seen at endoscopy have surprisingly little symptomatology. Nevertheless, indigestive symptoms can impair nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810889\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies suggested that gastric acid production decreased dramatically with age, with a decrease in parietal cells and an increase in interstitial leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Subsequent studies challenge those findings and suggest that 90 percent of people aged 65 and over are able to acidify gastric contents in the basal unstimulated state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection may account for the discrepancies between early and more recent work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Over 50 percent of older people are infected with <em>H. pylori</em>, with the prevalence increasing with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacteriology-and-epidemiology-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacteriology and epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Increased rates of gastritis and increased sensitivity to gastric irritants, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications or bisphosphonates, in older adults may be related to several age-related physiologic changes: decreased prostaglandin synthesis, decreased bicarbonate and nonparietal fluid secretion, delayed gastric emptying, and impaired microcirculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition to an increased sensitivity to gastric insults, rates of healing are impaired by a host of mechanisms in older people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Gastric motility is determined by the combined effects of the enteric nerves, smooth muscle, and the interstitial cells of Cajal. The number and volume of the interstitial cells of Cajal bodies decreases by over 10 percent per decade in normal people without motility complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In aging rat models, sensory neural function is decreased, delaying recognition of experimentally induced mucosal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810896\"><span class=\"h2\">Small intestine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The small intestine undergoes modest anatomic changes, including moderate villus atrophy and coarsening of the mucosae. The absorption of several micronutrients (eg, xylose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, B12, copper) may decrease with age but remain adequate for homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The efficiency of calcium absorption from the gut lumen decreases because of decreased vitamin D receptors in the gut and decreased levels of circulating 25(OH) vitamin D. Typically, women over age 75 absorb 25 percent less of a given dose of calcium than younger women, especially if there is reduced acid secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Iron may also be less well-absorbed, but overall aging impacts the absorption of macronutrients minimally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Consumed carbohydrates result in significantly more hydrogen excretion in the older adults, suggesting malabsorption and subsequent bacterial metabolism of the carbohydrate in the aging gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Up to 15 percent of residents in senior congregate housing have evidence of bacterial overgrowth as assessed by breath hydrogen testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Bacterial overgrowth and associated malabsorption can affect nutritional status and micronutrient absorption. Additionally, the barrier function of the small intestine may be compromised and local inflammation activated in response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Decreases in sensory and myenteric neurons contribute to the increased frequency of painless ulcers with increased age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,48</a>]. Interestingly, in several animal studies, caloric restriction has been shown to decrease myenteric neuronal loss with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810903\"><span class=\"h2\">Large intestine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic changes with aging in the large intestine include mucosal atrophy, cellular and structural abnormalities in the mucosal glands, hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosa, and atrophy of the muscularis externa. Functional changes include altered coordination of contraction and increased opioid sensitivity that may predispose the older person to drug-induced constipation.</p><p>Studies have not been consistent regarding alterations in colonic motility, but the general consensus is that colonic propulsive motility is reduced with age and about one-fourth of those over 65 years suffer from chronic constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. One factor contributing to reduced motility is an age-related reduction in myenteric plexus neurons and a decline in the interstitial cells of Cajal similar to that seen in the stomach Intrinsic sensory neurons that respond to physicochemical changes may degenerate disproportionately compared with motor enteric neurons. The loss of sensory input into local reflex pathways could contribute to reduced propulsive motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The loss of intrinsic sensory neurons may also contribute to the decreased visceral response to bowel perforation or ischemia that is classically observed in the older patient. As an example, the rigid surgical abdomen after appendiceal perforation is a less frequent finding in those over 75, leading to delayed diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Older women may be more predisposed to fecal incontinence than older men as the resting pressure and squeeze pressure decrease with age, resulting in decreased anal sphincter tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In one study, both male and female patients aged greater than 70 years had 30 to 40 percent decreases in sphincter pressures compared with controls less than 30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The internal anal sphincter of continent older people is thickened, perhaps to compensate for decreased resting and maximum pressures in the anal canal with age. However, thinning of the external sphincter correlated with fecal incontinence more than age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Diverticuli are common in Western populations over age 65, with prevalence &ge;65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The prevalence of diverticuli is lower in other populations, presumably with other diets, but nonetheless there remains a strong age-dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The formation of colonic diverticuli is attributed to decreased muscle wall strength, decreased bowel wall compliance, and increased intra-abdominal pressure required for stool excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Slower large bowel transit and increased segmental contractions (as opposed to propulsive contractions) result in increased water reabsorption, leaving harder stools and increasing the likelihood of wall failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In addition to prolonged exposure to potential carcinogens, aging is associated with increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in the colonic mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The biology of these changes is a rich area for exploration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The barrier function of colonic epithelium also appears to be compromised and has been implicated in promoting the proinflammatory state, &ldquo;inflammaging&rdquo;.

Renal mass decreases by 25 to 30 percent between the ages of 30 and 80 years, with the steepest decline after age 50. In addition, fat and fibrosis replace some of the remaining functional parenchyma. Loss occurs primarily in the renal cortex and preferentially affects those nephrons most important to maximal urine concentration.</p><p>Normal aging is associated with diffuse sclerosis of glomeruli such that 30 percent of glomeruli are destroyed by age 75 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The remaining glomeruli have impaired filtering ability. Intrarenal vascular changes include spiraling of the afferent arterioles, narrowing of the larger arteries, intimal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], and shunts between afferent and efferent arterioles allowing blood flow to bypass the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Nephrosclerosis (global glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis) was identified in donor kidneys to be used for transplantation in 3 percent of donors 18 to 29 years old and 73 percent of donors 70 to 77 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>At baseline, renal plasma blood flow is 40 percent lower in healthy normotensive older men than in young men and this difference is magnified under conditions that stimulate renal vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Studies suggest that older kidneys may be maintained in a state of vasodilation to compensate for loss of vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Vasodilating prostaglandins are increased at baseline in normal older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], and this contributes to the increased (roughly doubled) risk of renal injury with use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>Creatinine clearance decreases with age (7.5 to 10 mL per minute per decade), although there is wide variability in decline seen in longitudinal studies of healthy older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. As many as one-third have no change at all in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), one-third have a slight decline, and one-third have a more marked decline. Creatinine production also decreases with age and tubular secretion of creatinine increases, so that the serum creatinine may remain stable despite decreases in the GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. All of the commonly used equations for estimating creatinine clearance factor age into the formulae; however, the estimated GFR (eGFR) provided by some electronic health records need to be utilized cautiously, especially with those over 90 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. Cystatin C-based estimates of renal function may be useful when accurate assessment in an older person is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In healthy older people, an increase of roughly 50 percent in Cystatin C levels is seen from age 40 to age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculation-of-the-creatinine-clearance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calculation of the creatinine clearance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis are maintained relatively well with aging, in the absence of challenges. However, the ability to maximally dilute urine and excrete a water load is impaired and compromises volume regulation under conditions of stress. In the setting of dehydration, the minimum urine flow rate is twice as great in those over 70 compared with those under 40, and the maximum urine osmolality is also reduced with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. In addition to this impaired ability to retain water and solute, the older kidney also is impaired in its ability to retain amino acids and glucose.</p><p>Other functional changes in the renal system are a reduction of urine acidification and impairment in excreting an acid load. The older kidney is more prone to nephrotoxicity related to medications or intravenous contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Additionally, the injured older kidney is less likely to recover from acute insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The older kidney is also more vulnerable to ischemic insult, with a greater number of cells undergoing apoptosis following ischemia than in the young kidney. Tubular cells appear to have diminished ability to entirely repopulate the tubules after an acute ischemic insult.</p><p>In animal studies, hormonal functions of the kidney are affected by aging, such as decreasing hydroxylation of vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The production of erythropoietin in response to hemoglobin, however, appears to be unchanged with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810931\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advancing age increases the risk for hypertension and coronary artery disease. The prevalence of coronary artery disease at autopsy may reach 75 percent after the sixth decade in men and two decades later in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Therefore, to isolate age-related cardiovascular change from disease-related change, studies must carefully select older individuals with no underlying cardiovascular condition. The Baltimore Longitudinal study studied highly screened older individuals and found only a minimal impact of aging on resting cardiovascular function such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. This reflects the adequacy of the compensatory strategies used by the old heart (and vascular system) to counteract subtle and gradual age-associated physiologic, molecular, and biochemical changes. However, by invoking available compensatory mechanisms to maintain resting function, the older person is less able to compensate for subsequent challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23810854\" class=\"local\">'Homeostenosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Many older people perform little physical activity. Typical age changes may therefore also reflect the impact of factors related to lifestyle and comorbidity, and the contribution of age alone may be difficult to determine.</p><p>Minimal anatomic changes occur in the right side of the heart. By contrast, the left atrium enlarges and the left ventricle stiffens with aging. Left atrial volume, corrected for body size, increases roughly 50 percent from the third decade to the eighth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The left ventricle also hypertrophies with age, with an average increase in left ventricular wall thickness of 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Both the aortic valve and mitral annulus thicken and develop calcific deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Mitral annular calcification may predispose the older person to cardiac conduction problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Valvular heart disease in elderly adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ventricular cardiomyocytes hypertrophy, in part as a response to the increased afterload produced by large artery stiffening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. The largest myocytes are also the most vulnerable to challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Loss of myocytes with age has been reported to occur by both apoptosis and necrosis; the total number of cardiomyocytes may be reduced significantly in healthy human hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/100,102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,102,103</a>]. As well, substantial cellular dropout occurs in the sinoatrial (SA) node and more modest cellular loss at the atrioventricular node. This may underlie increased sensitivity of the older SA node to calcium channel blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>There is a negligible age-related decrease in the resting heart rate but a marked decrease in the maximum heart rate in response to exercise or other stressors. The intrinsic heart rate (the rate without sympathetic or parasympathetic input to the heart) decreases by five to six beats per minute each decade. The response to both parasympathetic antagonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>) and beta-adrenergic agonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a>) is decreased in healthy older people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Heart rate reflects the combined effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic tones. The target maximum heart rate is calculated as &quot;220 &ndash; age.&quot; Women may have a more gradual decline and a correction factor of 0.90-0.85 may adjust the target heart rate for women, although this is not always applied. Exercise training does not modify the age-associated decline in maximum heart rate. Heart rate variability, perhaps due to decreased parasympathetic tone and decreased sympathetic responsiveness, also decreases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of atrial premature beats increases with age but is not associated with increased cardiac risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. An increase in isolated ventricular ectopic beats is also seen in healthy older individuals and is part of the normal aging process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p>The culmination of age-associated cardiovascular changes is a decrease in maximum work, measured as maximum oxygen utilization (VO2max) on exercise testing. Exercise training in sedentary older individuals can improve this parameter, but a decline with age is seen even in highly trained individuals.</p><p>Resting LVEF is not changed in healthy older people, but there are smaller increases in LVEF in response to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. At maximum effort, LVEF in the young is above 80 percent while by age 80 it is 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Older hearts also have impaired early left ventricular filling with a compensatory greater contribution from atrial systole than younger hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. This may in part explain why atrial fibrillation is more likely to precipitate heart failure in older adults. An atrial gallop (S4) is a normal finding on physical examination in individuals in sinus rhythm over 75, a manifestation of the increased contribution of left atrial systole to ventricular filling.</p><p>The old heart is a vulnerable heart. For example, mortality and the probability of developing heart failure after a myocardial infarction increase dramatically with age. While myocardial infarction is not a part of normal aging, response to this systemic challenge is impaired because of the aging process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810938\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging, in the absence of additional challenges, does not result in hypoxia or pneumonia. However, age-related anatomic and functional changes in the respiratory system contribute to the increased frequency of pneumonia, increased likelihood of hypoxia, and decreased maximum oxygen uptake in the older person.</p><p>The lung undergoes a number of anatomic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Alveolar ducts enlarge due to loss of elastic tissue, resulting in a decreased surface area for gas exchange. Overall, about one-third of the surface area per volume of lung tissue is lost over the life span, and anatomic dead space increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The loss of lung elastic tissue decreases recoil and results in modest reduction in the expiratory boundary of the maximal flow-volume envelope. During maximal exercise, this may limit expiratory airflow and produce dynamic lung hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Surfactant composition is also altered by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>], and alveolar fluid has a greater content of proinflammatory proteins and a reduced antiinflammatory profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Carbon monoxide diffusion studies find that diffusion capacity decreases approximately 5 percent per decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>Age increases ventilation-perfusion mismatching because airways<strong> </strong>in dependent portions of the older lung, areas that are better perfused than elsewhere, are closed during all or part of the respiratory cycle. This is a critical factor in the declining arterial PO2 with age. Alveolar PO2 does not change with age, but age increases the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient. The effect of the ventilation-perfusion mismatch is more marked in the supine than sitting position because of positional changes in thoracic mechanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. The decrease in arterial PO2 (PaO2) may not be linear but appears to decline from age 30 until 70 or 75 and thereafter remains almost constant. While age-related changes do not result in hypoxia at sea level, older adults may approach hypoxia at altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. The fall on PaO2 is slightly greater in women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/117,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,119</a>]. Older people may have little reserve for further decrements in pulmonary function before important hemoglobin desaturation occurs.</p><p>In contrast to the decrease in PaO2 and increase in the A-a oxygen gradient, carbon dioxide excretion is not impaired with age; changes in PaCO2 are due to disease and should not be attributed to age alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>The chest wall also changes with age; increased stiffness of the chest wall predominates over an increase in compliance of the lung parenchyma. Overall chest wall compliance decreases by one-third from age 30 to 75 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Intercostal muscle contraction accounts for less chest expansion in older individuals, with a relatively greater contribution from abdominal muscles. Abdominal muscles are only partially effective in ventilating in the seated (or supine) position. Thus, full airway expansion occurs only in the standing position in older adults. Atelectasis can result in an increased A-a gradient.</p><p>As the chest remodels with age, the diaphragm flattens and becomes less efficient. The diaphragmatic changes likely contribute to the increase in the work of breathing during exercise, which can increase 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p>The effect of age on traditional pulmonary function tests is shown in the graph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67608 \">figure 2</a>). With advancing age, functional reserves decrease. In nonsmoking men, forced vital capacity (FVC) decreases between 0.15 and 0.3 liters per decade, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decreases by 0.2 to 0.3 liters per decade, with steeper decline in the seventh and eight decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>]. Age-related changes in women decline less steeply. Total lung capacity (proportional to height) does not change significantly with age; however, the residual volume (air left in the lung at the end of full expiration) increases by as much as 10 percent per decade because of a higher closing volume. Of note, however, the ability to properly perform pulmonary function tests (and use inhalers) decreases in older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p>The Cardiovascular Health Study population experienced age-related decreases in maximal inspiratory force and a smaller decrement in maximal expiratory force parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Both the inspiratory force and expiratory force are significantly greater in physically active older people. Diaphragm thickness was also greater in the active old group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. Thus, some of the decrements described above are due to sedentary lifestyle.</p><p>Older persons have decreased responses to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and mechanical loading, such as breathing through a small-diameter endotracheal tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. The central drive to the respiratory muscles is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Many of these changes are minimized with exercise; the implication is that central or peripheral receptor hyporesponsiveness may be due in part to deconditioning, and that exercise training can induce compensation for age-related changes.</p><p>Cough is less vigorous in the older person because of the age effects on respiratory muscle strength and greater closing volumes that prevent clearing of increasing proportions of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Mucociliary clearance is slower and less effective, and recovery of mucociliary clearance after insult (typically viral infection) is slowed with age. In addition to impaired clearance from large airways, clearance of inhaled particles from the small conducting airways is also impaired with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>The rate of decline in the peak aerobic capacity in healthy older persons with age, especially men, is not constant. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging found a 3 to 6 percent decrease in peak aerobic capacity per decade in the 30s and more than 20 percent decrease in peak aerobic capacity per decade in the 70s and beyond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].

The sperm from older testes have an increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities and impaired motility and decreased ability to fertilize even when administered by intrauterine artificial insemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. The seminiferous tubules also degenerate and Leydig cell number decreases. Changes in the epididymis and seminal vesicles are characterized by deposition of pigmented granules in the epithelial walls and amyloid in the seminal vesicle wall, which may be associated with amyloid deposition elsewhere in the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].</p><p>Enlargement of the prostate gland occurs with age.

In women of advanced age undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment (defined here as after 45), the implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates all occur at reduced frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. Changes related to menopause and estrogen depletion are discussed separately.

The vagina loses elasticity. The clitoris, like the older penis, needs greater stimulation and becomes less engorged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. Subcutaneous fat in the pelvis is lost. Vaginal dryness and atrophy are mostly estrogen-dependent but may be compounded by age-related diminished blood flow to the vagina. Cervicovaginal secretions, especially during arousal, become sparser. Vaginal pH rises, allowing colonization by enteric microflora.

The loss is not linear, but it accelerates with increasing age. Sarcopenia, age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, is defined as a decrease in appendicular muscle mass two standard deviations below the mean for young healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. Sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for mortality in longitudinal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p>In many sites, muscle quality decreases with infiltration of fat and connective tissue into the old muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. The presence of intramuscular and intermuscular fat has been termed &quot;myosteatosis.&quot; Myosteatosis at the thigh has been associated with decreased strength, slower gait speed, and decreased survival in the AGES-Reykjavik study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/149,150\" class=\"abstract_t\">149,150</a>]; a mortality relationship was not seen with the calf myosteatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. Critically, myosteatosis needs to be taken in context, as trained individuals acquire muscle fat as a ready energy supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>], and in that setting increased muscle fat is associated with better performance and exercise training in older people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].</p><p>The loss of muscle mass is not uniform; in general, the loss from the legs is greater than from the arms. Type I slow-twitch fibers are less affected by age than fast-twitch fibers. In any muscle bundle, the size of the myofibrils decreases, followed by the number of myofibrils. Innervation of skeletal muscle decreases in men over 50; the number of motor units in any given muscle decreases with a compensatory increase in motor unit size. While this synaptic remodeling occurs at all ages, the &quot;new&quot; neuromuscular innervations are unstable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Some have implicated motor neuron changes as the primary cause of sarcopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. The loss of muscle contributes to age-related insulin resistance, age-related changes in body composition, and volumes of distribution for water soluble drugs.</p><p>The presence of atrophied or partially or completely denervated muscle fibers can be seen on cross-section of muscle from an older person. Time to peak tension with ankle dorsiflexion is slowed, as is time to muscle relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. Strength also decreases dramatically with age, partially explained by loss in muscle mass. From age 30 to age 80, a typical person's grip strength decreases 60 percent; however, activity plays an important mitigating role. Overall, lower-extremity strength is lost at a relatively faster rate than upper-extremity strength; activity may decrease the rate of decline but will not completely prevent it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. The older muscle is more easily fatigued as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>].</p><p>The recovery of older muscle after injury is slowed and frequently incomplete. At least some of this impairment is locally mediated, perhaps by nerve regeneration, as old muscles transplanted into young animals regenerate fairly well, while muscles taken from young animals and transplanted into old ones do not regain mass and generate force as effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p>Skeletal muscle from older adults shows altered energetics. The decrease in enzyme activity of glycolytic enzymes is greater than that of oxidative enzymes. Physical activity plays a significant role in the decrease in these enzyme activities. In older animals, an acute bout of exercise is associated with relative hypoperfusion of the most oxidatively active exercising muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].</p><p>Age-related hormonal changes in growth hormone, androgen, and possibly others may contribute to the age-associated alterations muscle mass and function. Parabiosis studies (where old and young syngenic mice are connected so that they share circulations) suggest circulating factors may restore many of these age-associated decrements in muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/160,161\" class=\"abstract_t\">160,161</a>]. Additionally, proinflammatory cytokines increase with age and stimulate the rate of skeletal muscle protein degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. The effects of many of these agents, especially insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, may be mediated by neuromuscular effects, suggesting that both hormonal and neuronal approaches to preventing sarcopenia may be efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584138090\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging in both men and women increases the probability of fracture and the rate of repair is slowed, once fracture occurs. The increased proinflammatory environment in healthy older adults promotes bone loss. Anatomically, the weightbearing cortical bones lose substance from the endosteal surface. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicate that the marrow lumen of the femur is larger, the cortex thins, and fat fills much of the marrow cavities. The aging loss of mineral occurs in both cortical (peripheral skeleton) and trabecular (axial skeleton) bone. There is a progressive decline in osteoblast number and activity, but osteoclasts remain unchanged with age. Overall, the decline in bone mass is approximately 0.5 percent per year in healthy older people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>]. Age-related changes in women are compounded by menopausal changes in bone mass and function. Vitamin D deficiency, common in older people, further accelerates bone loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Weightbearing exercise is frequently reduced in older adults, contributing to a negative calcium balance and loss of bone mineral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Increasing weightbearing time or increasing loading forces may increase bone mineral and prevent age-related bone loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].</p><p>Once bones fracture, the repair mechanisms are impaired in aging. In older animals, fractures produce less local blood vessel formation and less osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells and require at least twice as long to regain prefracture biomechanical properties, including strength, than in younger adult animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. Cells isolated from old bones are less responsive to vitamin D than young ones. The matrix in old individuals may stimulate less bone formation than matrix from younger people. This suggests that growth factors (eg, IGF-1) may be deficient or inhibitory factors may be present in the old matrix. Supplementation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), parathyroid hormone, vitamin D and calcium, statins, and some of the bone morphogenic proteins have all shown promise in facilitating bone healing in various experimental paradigms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4531962\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4531969\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomical and physiological changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of the brain decreases about 7 cm<sup>3</sup> per year after age 65, with greatest loss in the frontal and temporal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>] and greater loss of white matter than grey matter in cognitively normal older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Cerebral blood flow decreases heterogeneously by 5 to 20 percent, with deterioration of mechanisms that maintain cerebral blood flow with fluctuation in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>].</p><p>Age-related neuronal loss is most prominent in the largest neurons in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. The hypothalamus, the pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>], and the medulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/171,172\" class=\"abstract_t\">171,172</a>] have modest if any neuron or volume losses with normal aging. Age-related neuron dropout is likely due to apoptosis (ie, programmed cell death) rather than inflammation, ischemia, or another mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>]. Age also affects neurons that persist, with loss of the dendritic tree, shrinkage of processes, and decrease of synapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>]. Such changes may contribute more to the age-related loss of brain volume than the loss of neurons. In some areas, however, the dendritic connections may increase, perhaps as a result of repatterning of the brain invoked to compensate for cellular dropout. Neurons continue to form new synapses, and new neurons are formed throughout the lifespan, but the rates of loss are greater than the gains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>].</p><p>Lipofuscin accumulates in certain areas of the brain, particularly the hippocampus and frontal cortex, but the impact of lipofuscin on function is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>]. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques occur in certain areas of the brain in normal aging but to a lesser extent than in Alzheimer disease. Thus, interpretation of beta amyloid seen on amyloid imaging in individuals of advanced age poses a challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>]. Similar issues may be raised for tau imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>].</p><p>Multiple nonhomogenous changes in brain enzymes, receptors, and neurotransmitters occur with age. Acetylcholine availability decreases due to decrease in cholinergic and muscarinic neurons, and reduced release and synthesis of acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/174,179\" class=\"abstract_t\">174,179</a>]. As well, dopamine and corresponding receptors in the striatum and substantia nigra may be decreased in normal aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/180\" class=\"abstract_t\">180</a>]. Interestingly, dopamine may facilitate episodic memory persistence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>], and providing dopamine as L-DOPA to normal old brains can improve performance on some cognitive tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>].</p><p>Age-related changes seen on functional brain scanning with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/183\" class=\"abstract_t\">183</a>]. For many tasks, the old brain seems to work harder than the young one, recruiting more neurons and with higher energetic expense as shown by PET scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>]. For a simple recall test of letters, a greater volume of activation was seen in old brains.

These are late-life changes, occurring after the sixth decade and have a linear or accelerating decline with further aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. Processing speed decreases with age and can have a global effect on the testing performance of other neurocognitive domains in any timed test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>].</p><p>Executive function is critical to engagement in purposeful, independent, and self-preserving behavior and is necessary for an older person to successfully manage their own medical illnesses.

These impairments, similar to processing speed, may lead to decreased testing performance in other neurocognitive domains.</p><p>Problem-solving, reasoning about unfamiliar things, processing and learning new information, and attending to and manipulating one's environment show a steady decline (by about -0.02 standard deviations per year) after peaking around age 30.

Neural recruitment in the aging brain is used to accomplish less novel tasks.

Removing an adhesive dressing from an older person may dislodge the epidermis because the dermoepidermal junction is weaker than the bond between the skin and the dressing. Bleeding into the space between the dermis and epidermis occurs more frequently.</p><p>Loss of undulations at the dermoepidermal junction decreases the area available for nutrient transfer, including protective lipids in the stratum corneum. This results in dry skin (xerosis) and a compromise in the barrier function of the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/201\" class=\"abstract_t\">201</a>]. Epidermal turnover is slowed due to decreased division of keratinocytes and longer migration from the basal layer to the skin surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/202\" class=\"abstract_t\">202</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual impairment in adults: Refractive disorders and presbyopia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The older eye adapts more slowly to changes in lighting conditions; the pupil becomes rigid and the lens more opaque. The rate of synthesis of photopigment slows with age, adding to slowed adaptation to lower light conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/219\" class=\"abstract_t\">219</a>]. Lens alterations increase light scattering, making the older person more sensitive to glare. After lens removal, the glare threshold becomes normal.</p><p>Finally, contrast sensitivity declines, so older persons need increased color contrast to discriminate between target and background. This factor should be taken into account in the design of living environments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23810994\"><span class=\"h2\">Hearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-related changes in the auditory system produce decrements in high-frequency hearing acuity and impaired speech recognition in noisy environments. The loss of hearing acuity may result in social isolation and increases risk for delirium during hospitalization. The cumulative effects of environmental or occupational noise confound interpretation of age effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With age, the walls of the external auditory canal thin. The cerumen becomes drier and more tenacious, increasing the risk of cerumen impaction in older people. Although the ossicular joints degenerate with age, sound transmission by the ossicles is well-preserved.</p><p>The inner ear experiences at least five distinct changes that occur to varying degrees:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair cells in the organ of Corti are lost, initially affecting those in the basal end of the cochlea that respond to the highest frequencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurons innervating the cochlear and in the auditory centers of the brain are lost</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basilar membrane underlying the sensory apparatus stiffens and may calcify</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The capillaries of the stria vascularis (the source of endolymph) thicken</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spiral ligament degenerates</p><p/><p>Which of these five changes is dominant will define subgroups of age-related hearing. The net results are loss of hearing acuity, especially at higher frequencies (presbycusis), difficulty with speech discrimination, and problems localizing the sources of sound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/220,221\" class=\"abstract_t\">220,221</a>].</p><p>Some older individuals who say they cannot hear in fact are having difficulty understanding what is said. Many of the consonant sounds are in the higher frequencies (t, k, ch), and patients may not comprehend speech if they cannot appreciate those sounds. Strategically and practically, it may be better to rephrase a question that is not understood by an older person rather than repeat it in a louder voice, especially because pitch (frequency) is often raised when volume is increased. Additionally older people may have difficulty discriminating target sound from background noise, adding to challenges of communicating in social situations or noisy emergency departments. In these patients, amplification of sound alone is not effective because both target and background are amplified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23811001\"><span class=\"h2\">Taste and smell</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are visible changes in the taste buds with age, though they have modest impact on the sense. Although the number of papillae on the tongue decreases with aging, neurophysiologic responses of individual papillae are minimally altered, and there is no relation between gustatory acuity and number of taste buds.</p><p>Loss of taste in older patients is in large part due to decreased olfaction rather than taste itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, taste sensitivity also decreases with age, as shown by a study in which older patients required 30 percent higher concentrations of aspartame to detect this artificial sweetener [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/222,223\" class=\"abstract_t\">222,223</a>].</p><p>Similarly, more salt (two- to threefold) needs to be added to tomato soup before it can be appreciated by an older person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/224\" class=\"abstract_t\">224</a>]. The effects of age on the tongue need not be uniform, with regions of deficient gustatory sense becoming more common with age.</p><p>The acuity of olfaction declines significantly with age. Detection thresholds are increased by more than 50 percent in healthy people by age 80; recognition of familiar smells decreases similarly, including the recognition of spoiled food and of a gas stove left on. The cause of the decreased olfactory sense is unclear, but the sensation area decreases, the number of sensing neurons decreases, and the ability of the older person to replenish dying olfactory receptor neurons is compromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/224\" class=\"abstract_t\">224</a>].</p><p>Decreased taste and smell sensation may result in decreased enjoyment of food and an age-related difficulty in sorting tastes of mixed or combined foods. The role of olfaction in maintaining appetite is critical; for example, some people with anosmia forget to eat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23811008\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of all the changes that occur with age, decrements in immune functions are among the most critical, contributing to the increased frequency of infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders. These changes are mentioned briefly here and reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunosenescence, or the aging of the immune system, does not impact all immune processes equally. Some of the responses that are most affected by age include the ability of lymphocytes (both B and T cells) to work in concert to generate effective immune responses upon exposure to new antigens, in the form of either infections or vaccinations.</p><p>An important concept in immunosenescence is that of loss of precise regulation of inflammatory processes. Older adults display cytokine profiles that are consistent with a chronic, low-level inflammatory state, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;inflammaging&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/225\" class=\"abstract_t\">225</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189995853\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR BASIS OF AGING</span></p><p>The molecular basis for age-related physiologic changes is a subject of intense active investigation. The process of natural selection (in which genes that promote beneficial conditions in early or reproductive years are selected for, and genes associated with harmful conditions are selected against), does not play a significant role in later life. Despite the lack of selection for late-life genes, some processes that may provide benefit early in life could be detrimental later in life, so-called antagonist pleiotropy.</p><p>For more than 50 years, the most robust means to increase survival and modify many age-related changes was to use caloric restriction. Reducing caloric intake by 20 to 40 percent in laboratory some of the most common strains of mice and rats increased median and maximum lifespan by 20 to 50 percent but did not increase survival in about 50 percent of tested mouse strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/226\" class=\"abstract_t\">226</a>]. Studies with non-human primates have been less promising, and despite having lower cholesterol, better insulin sensitivity, etc, survival has not been increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/227,228\" class=\"abstract_t\">227,228</a>].</p><p>Several findings suggest that shortening of the telomere (nucleoprotein end caps on chromosomes) is involved in increased vulnerability of aging cells to DNA damage and dysregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/229-231\" class=\"abstract_t\">229-231</a>]. The shortened telomeres, as well as other replicative dysregulation, may lead to inadequate replacement of damaged or dead cells from their respective precursor cell populations. Interestingly, many of these resting precursors cells start to differentiate along adipocyte-like pathways, rather than into other tissue types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Subpopulations of adipocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and other cells may enter senescence with aging and develop the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/232\" class=\"abstract_t\">232</a>]. SASP cells have the potential to release proinflammatory cytokines and other potentially harmful factors as well as modify the activity of local normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/233\" class=\"abstract_t\">233</a>]. Other hypotheses implicate the p53 gene that is activated when DNA is damaged. This gene activation may mediate several molecular processes affecting cell function and viability: normal cell growth and division is halted, with apoptosis for cells that rapidly turnover; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators PGC<sub>1-alpha </sub>and PGC<sub>1-beta </sub>are repressed and lead to loss of muscle mitochondria and buildup of free radicals with loss of antioxidant defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/234\" class=\"abstract_t\">234</a>].</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates nutrient distribution and is believed to play an important role in the ability of caloric restriction to extend lifespan. Rapamycin has been shown to produce longevity in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/235\" class=\"abstract_t\">235</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23811022\"><span class=\"h1\">LONGEVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longevity predictions are important in many aspects of medical care. Limited survival will impact the benefits of initiating medications or performing procedures or screening tests. Decision-making regarding the appropriateness of a specific intervention (eg, &quot;Should this older person be given a bisphosphonate to prevent osteoporosis?&quot;) requires recognition of both the likely survival time for an individual and how long it may take for the intervention to have effect.</p><p>One classic study provides survival data on individuals in the United States, stratified into quartiles by survival for each five-year period above age 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/236\" class=\"abstract_t\">236</a>]. The absence of significant comorbid conditions, or the presence of superior functional status for age, identifies older adults who are likely to live longer than average. Conversely, individuals with functional dependencies in activities of daily living <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant comorbidity (eg, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive lung disease) have a life expectancy substantially below the average for <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> age.</p><p>Age-related modification of risk-benefit relationships has broad applicability. In addition to the documentation of the broad range of life-expectancy for a given age, a table has been developed to measure the likely benefit against the potential risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53094 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>For example, a typical 85-year-old man who has a symptomatic inguinal hernia is likely to have the problem for another 4.7 years and thus may warrant a discussion of surgical repair. Note that the tables are based on a US Caucasian population and may not be generalizable to other groups. Also, the tables do not account quality of life for the specified years. Both of these issues may critically modify the interpretation of the tabular data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189996508\"><span class=\"h2\">Successful aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;successful aging&quot; is used to identify older individuals who are free from chronic disease and continue to function well into old age, both physically and cognitively. The term &quot;essentially healthy&quot; identifies those with no acute disease, no recent history of cancer, and with well-controlled chronic disease. &quot;Exceptionally healthy&quot; identifies older adults who take no medications, have no chronic disease, are normotensive, and have a normal body weight. Psychosocial and genetic factors contribute to successful aging as well as longevity.</p><p>Predictors of high functional status in both physical and cognitive domains were evaluated in the longitudinal Cardiovascular Health Study, following 1677 participants for 14 years (median age 85, range 77 to 102, at study endpoint) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/237\" class=\"abstract_t\">237</a>]. Although all participants showed functional decline over time, 53 percent remained functionally intact, and this group had a higher baseline health profile and lower vascular disease risk. Greater physical impairment was found in women and in those with greater weight. Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were predictors for both cognitive and physical impairment.</p><p>In another longitudinal study of nearly 6000 British civil service employees followed for 17 years, successful aging was identified in 12.8 percent of men and 14.6 percent of women at follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/238\" class=\"abstract_t\">238</a>]. The strongest predictor of successful aging was socioeconomic position at midlife. After adjustment for socioeconomics, not smoking, diet, exercise, moderate alcohol intake (in women), and work support (in men) predicted healthy aging.</p><p>The effect of genetics on longevity and life expectancy has been explored in observational studies and in animal experiments. As noted above, twin studies suggest that 25 percent of longevity is genetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the importance of genetics is substantially larger at the extremes of longevity and may be greater for men than for women. In the New England Centenarian Study, male siblings of centenarians had a 17 times greater chance of living to age 100 compared with birth cohorts, compared with eight times greater for females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/239\" class=\"abstract_t\">239</a>].</p><p>A polymorphism in the Cholesterol Ester Transfer Protein gene has been identified that is associated with successful aging, increased longevity, preserved cognition, less cardiovascular disease, and larger sized high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in Ashkenazi Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/240\" class=\"abstract_t\">240</a>]. Animal models suggest the potential for gene manipulation to prolong longevity. For example, the median and maximum survival of the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis&nbsp;elegans</em> can be increased threefold by mutating the daf-16 gene, a key regulator of <span class=\"nowrap\">insulin/insulin-like</span> growth factor (IGF)-like pathways in the worm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/241\" class=\"abstract_t\">241</a>].</p><p>Environmental factors are likely to interact with genetics. In Italy, the ratio of female to male centenarians is quite variable, ranging from 2:1 in Sardinia to 7:1 in Northern Italy, suggesting a gene-environment interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/242\" class=\"abstract_t\">242</a>]. Okinawa, Japan, has the highest concentration of centenarians in the world. The longevity there has been attributed to a &quot;caloric restriction with optimal nutrition&quot; diet, similar to diets that increase longevity by 50 percent in mice and rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/243\" class=\"abstract_t\">243</a>]. A genetic component is also possible, based on family studies of Okinawan centenarians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/244\" class=\"abstract_t\">244</a>]. Extreme female longevity may be less dependent on genetics than male longevity and more related to a healthier lifestyle and more favorable environmental conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-aging/abstract/242\" class=\"abstract_t\">242</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Several overarching physiologic principles characterize aging: loss of complexity as seen in less variability in heart rate responses, altered circadian patterns, and loss of physiologic reserves needed to cope with challenges to homeostasis. (See <a href=\"#H23810845\" class=\"local\">'Age-associated physiologic changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional bone marrow reserves are reduced, with delayed response to blood loss or hypoxia. White blood cell function is impaired and myelotoxicity from chemotherapy is often increased. Advancing age leads to a procoagulant state, with increased platelet responsiveness and levels of clotting factors. (See <a href=\"#H23810861\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflux esophagitis, due to altered contractions and sphincter tone, is common with age and may affect nutrition. <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection is common, and sensitivity to gastric irritants such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is increased. Colonic changes include motility changes resulting in constipation, decreased visceral response to bowel perforation or ischemia, colon diverticuli, and increased risk for colon cancer. (See <a href=\"#H23810868\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal mass and function decline, with decrease in creatinine clearance and ability to maximally dilute urine or excrete an acid load. The older kidney is more prone to nephrotoxicity related to medications or intravenous contrast. (See <a href=\"#H23810924\" class=\"local\">'The renal system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is difficult to isolate the impact of age alone on the cardiovascular system, since age increases risk for hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a more sedentary lifestyle. There is an age-related decrease in maximum heart rate, as well as the compensatory response of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to exercise. The annulus of both the aortic and mitral valve thicken, with development of valvular calcific deposits. (See <a href=\"#H23810931\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About one-third of surface area per volume of lung tissue is lost over the lifespan, with increase in anatomic dead space increases and decrease in functional reserves. Age increases the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient, more marked in the supine than sitting position. Cough is less vigorous in the older person and mucociliary clearance is slower. (See <a href=\"#H23810938\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aging changes in the genitourinary system increase the older person's risk of urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, erectile dysfunction, and dyspareunia. (See <a href=\"#H23810945\" class=\"local\">'Genitourinary system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With aging, muscle mass decreases in relation to body weight, leading to impaired motility and balance, as well as age-related increased insulin resistance and changes in the volume of distribution for water soluble drugs. Aging increases the probability of fracture and slows the rate of fracture repair. Increasing weightbearing may increase bone mineral and prevent age-related bone loss. (See <a href=\"#H23810973\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal aging of the skin leads to atrophy, decreased elasticity, and impaired metabolic and reparative responses. Photoaging, not physiologic aging, produces 90 percent of the cosmetically undesirable changes in skin. (See <a href=\"#H23810980\" class=\"local\">'Skin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presbyopia is due to age-related changes in the lens and iris. Age-related changes in the auditory system produce decrements in high-frequency hearing acuity and impaired speech recognition in noisy environments. Loss of taste in older patients is in large part due to decreased olfaction rather than taste itself. Decreased taste and smell sensation may result in decreased enjoyment of food and result in nutritional deficiencies. (See <a href=\"#H23810987\" class=\"local\">'Sensory system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrements in immune functions with aging are among the most critical changes, contributing to the increased frequency of infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders.
