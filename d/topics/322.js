Patients may experience anxiety in anticipation of <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> during many types of procedures, including for screening (eg, mammography), diagnosis (eg, amniocentesis or endoscopy), and treatment (eg, angioplasty or open heart surgery). </p><p>Specific phobias are a subset of the varied manifestations of acute procedure anxiety, diagnosed under DSM-5 criteria only when the patient&rsquo;s fears are specific to the procedure and its immediate effects (eg, fear of suffocation during an MRI) rather than fears not specific to the procedure itself (eg, a fear of the underlying illness that might be diagnosed). Specific phobias related to clinical procedures include blood-injection-injury phobia, dental phobia, and MRI claustrophobia.</p><p>This topic addresses the course, screening, assessment, and differential diagnosis of acute procedure anxiety in adults, related to common medical and surgical procedures. The topic includes specific phobias with anxiety related to clinical care. Specific phobias unrelated to clinical care are discussed separately. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of acute procedure anxiety are also discussed separately.

This pattern has been observed in short, prospective studies of sigmoidoscopy screening for colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], colposcopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">neurosurgery/brain</span> biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>],<strong> </strong>percutaneous coronary intervention (PTCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, a study of PTCA that followed patients for a longer period of time after PCTA found anxiety level to be equally high six to eight months post-procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The course of specific phobia is discussed separately.

The role of screening for other procedures is less clearly established. </p><p>Among the instruments available for screening patients for acute procedure anxiety, we find the following to provide the best balance of psychometric properties and burden.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5619337\"><span class=\"h2\">Dental anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Dental Anxiety Scale&ndash;Revised (DAS-R), a brief, four-item patient self-administered questionnaire, is suggested for screening and measuring the severity of dental anxiety. The Dental Anxiety Scale has been shown to be a valid and highly reliability measure for dental anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A score of 13 or above constitutes a positive screen. A score of 15 or higher indicates a highly anxious patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F85572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85572 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5619344\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI claustrophobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Claustrophobia Questionnaire, a 26-item patient self-administered questionnaire, measures fear of restriction and fear of suffocation in certain situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is used in research, but is long for use in clinical practice. A six-question version, known as the Claustrophobia Miniscreen, is suggested for screening patients for MRI claustrophobia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F85573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85573 \">table 2</a>). A study of 80 adult MRI patients suggested that the six items can discriminate between patients who will and will not panic during an MRI scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A score of nine or above on the Miniscreen was highly predictive of panic during the scan. Further psychometric evaluation of the Miniscreen has not been conducted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2321690\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaesthesia and surgical procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), a six-item patient self-administered questionnaire, measures fear of anaesthesia and surgical procedures, and need for information about the procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F105211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105211 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].<strong> &#160;</strong>The APAIS takes less than two minutes to complete. It has been shown to be valid and reliable instrument in identifying preoperative anxiety and need for information. A cut-off score of 11 or above in the anxiety subscale is considered a positive screen for anxiety. A score of 5 or higher on the information subscale indicates a need to provide information about the procedure beyond the informed consent process. The APAIS has been translated and validated in many different languages, including English [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>],<strong> </strong>Japanese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>],<strong> </strong>German [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], French [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>],<strong> </strong>and Malay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875733\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of acute procedure anxiety can be identified by the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive fear or anxiety about a procedure triggered by the thought of needing to undergo the procedure, by the need to attend an upcoming, scheduled procedure, or during the procedure. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The elevated anxiety stems from concerns related to a clinical procedure.

Familiarity with a procedure may alleviate unwarranted fears about the pain or discomfort caused by the procedure. Increased fear upon repeating the procedure may be due to concerns about progression of the underlying illness, such as in a study of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A past negative experience with a procedure can increase anxiety in patients who are repeating the procedure, as seen in patients undergoing gynecological exams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-course-screening-assessment-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875609\"><span class=\"h2\">History of acute procedure anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient has previously experienced acute procedure anxiety, the clinician should inquire about previous coping strategies or past treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875602\"><span class=\"h2\">History of specific fears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should ask whether the patient has previously experienced specific fears, in particular, fear of seeing blood, fear of injections, fear of dental treatments, and fear of being in small spaces.

The focus of fear in agoraphobia is fear of losing control and consequences of having a panic attack, incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. It is not about harm caused by the phobic situation or fear of suffocation or confinement as in MRI claustrophobia. An agoraphobia diagnosis requires anxiety and avoidance of at least two situations, rather than one type of situation, such as an enclosed space.

However, in panic disorder, the focus of fear is the fear of the panic attack itself and concerns about the consequence or implication of a panic attack. Fear is not focused on aspects of the procedure, as in acute procedure anxiety.

Cardiac conditions that may present with panic-like symptoms include acute coronary syndrome or arrhythmia; respiratory conditions include pulmonary embolism (including air embolism), pneumothorax, or hemothorax. Air embolism to the lungs should be considered in any procedure that involves injections or central venous catheter placement. The evaluation for general medical conditions that may mimic a panic attack is described separately.
