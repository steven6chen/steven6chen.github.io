Cough is the most common reason why patients acutely seek medical consult in countries where data are available such as in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cough as a symptom is sometimes trivialized by health professionals, but is often distressing to parents irrespective of whether the cough is acute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] or chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>There are many causes of cough; the majority originate in the lungs but there are also nonpulmonary etiologies, some proven and others controversial. The causes are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>) and further discussed in another topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic cough in children&quot;</a>). Careful assessment of children with chronic cough is important to identify any underlying disease. Etiologies of chronic cough in children are different to adults and, thus, clinicians should use pediatric-specific cough guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, gastroesophageal reflux and upper airway cough syndrome (formerly known as postnasal drip syndrome), are thought to be common causes of chronic cough in adults, but are controversial as common causes of chronic cough in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The approach outlined in this topic review is designed for use in all patients up to 18 years of age. However, for adolescents 15 years and older, it is reasonable to use adult guidelines and algorithms, since the etiologies of chronic cough in adolescents are fairly similar to those in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-subacute-and-chronic-cough-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of subacute and chronic cough in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>An approach to the diagnosis and management of chronic cough in children is presented here, preceded by a brief overview of the epidemiology, physiology, and pathophysiology. Approaches to wheezing and stridor in children are presented separately, although these symptoms may present concurrently. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-stridor-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of stridor in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H937094814\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651262326\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic cough in children 14 years and younger usually is defined as a daily cough lasting four or more weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This definition is based upon expert consensus, as expressed in guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The rationale is that most acute respiratory infections in children resolve within this interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and that the presence of chronic cough impairs quality of life (QoL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and may represent sinister underlying etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The four-week threshold was selected to permit relatively early diagnosis of serious underlying illness such as missed foreign body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] to prevent future respiratory morbidity. However, these guidelines also envision watchful waiting for certain patients with chronic cough when specific symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs (specific cough pointers) are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The British Thoracic Society (BTS) utilizes a threshold of eight weeks duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which is the threshold used to define chronic cough in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the guideline also encourages individualized management by including the caveat that a &quot;relentlessly progressive prolonged acute cough [&gt;three weeks]&hellip;may warrant investigation before eight weeks&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260106217\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific cough refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying physiologic cause (which is usually but not always of pulmonary origin). The most important causes of specific cough in children are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>). In most cases, an initial workup consisting of a focused history, physical examination, chest radiography, and spirometry will identify features that serve as clues to the underlying disease (sometimes termed, &quot;specific cough pointers&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>). These include classically recognized cough sounds and characteristics, such as whooping, honking, or absence of cough during sleep, which point to a specific cause (these are sometimes termed &quot;classical&quot; cough characteristics) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113265 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3730936623\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific cough</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversely, a &quot;nonspecific&quot; cough is defined as a chronic cough that does <strong>not</strong> have an identifiable cause, after a reasonable evaluation. A chronic cough is more likely to be nonspecific if it is dry and there are no abnormalities identified on initial evaluation (ie, no &quot;specific cough pointers&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>)).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2177378393\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429169008\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of chronic cough varies depending on many factors, including the definition of chronicity used in the studies, age of children, and how cough is determined. Epidemiology questionnaires on isolated chronic cough are generally poorly reproducible; reproducibility is generally better for chronic cough associated with other symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The reporting of cough severity depends upon the population characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, the accuracy of cough reporting by urban Australian parents is excellent compared with an objective measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. By contrast, the accuracy of parent-reported cough is worse if the parent smokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], is a member of an indigenous Australian population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], or if the cough is nocturnal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Because of the considerations outlined above, the accuracy and generalizability of prevalence studies are limited, and it is often impossible to compare results across different studies. In one community-based study in which persistent cough was defined as &gt;3 weeks duration, the prevalence in children aged 5 to 11 years was approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The study found that reported persistent cough was higher in Australia than Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], possibly reflecting a reporting bias. Another questionnaire-based study reported a prevalence of chronic cough of 22 percent among preschoolers without colds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3065593694\"><span class=\"h2\">Burden</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The burden of chronic cough is substantial for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and their parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. Their quality of life (QoL) is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>] and in affluent countries, parents often seek recurrent consultations until their child's cough resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An Australian multicenter study found that 75 percent of parents sought &ge;5 doctor visits (14 percent sought &ge;15 consultations) for their child's cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The study also reported that the children's mean generic pediatric health-related QoL score (using the PedsQL tool) was in the realm of children with other chronic illness (eg, cardiac, diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Their QoL significantly improved when the cough resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At a societal level, expenses for physician visits, medication expenses, and absenteeism are substantial. Thus, it is not surprising that various prescription and nonprescription medications are reported to be widely used (sometimes inappropriately) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] in an attempt to ameliorate cough. The use of these medications may result in adverse events (eg, Cushing's disease and accidental poisoning) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1209379139\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intact cough mechanism (afferent and central limb) and apparatus (efferent limb) is essential to maintain respiratory health. Cough also enhances mucociliary clearance in both healthy individuals and those with lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1910492527\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal cough mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cough pathway, a complex reflex arc, can be simplified into the afferent, central, and efferent pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113194 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. The cough pathway may be self-initiated (eg, voluntary cough) or a reflex mechanism. The central pathway involves the nucleus tractus solitarius, the brainstem respiratory network (sometimes known as the &quot;cough center&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], the subcortex, and cortex. The afferent arm (from cough stimulus to the central pathway) and efferent arms (from central pathway to respiratory muscles, larynx, and pelvic muscles) are likely to be influenced by a multidirectional feedback loop mediated through the cough center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Cough has three mechanical physiological phases: inspiratory, compressive, and expiratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>], although some include a preceding irritation phase. The duration of inspiratory, compressive, and expiratory phases and magnitude of the respiratory muscles are regulated by the brainstem network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This same network also regulates these respiratory muscles for breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The entire respiratory structure and system undergoes a maturation process from infancy to adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The cough reflex is weak in premature infants and develops with maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Whilst the laryngeal chemoreflex in young infants result in swallowing, apnea, and laryngeal closure, cough becomes increasingly prominent with maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Exactly when the cough reflex is fully matured is unknown, but critical windows of exposure in utero and early childhood have long been appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The immune system (which has its own developmental physiology) affects the degree and frequency of respiratory infections, and hence presentations to doctors for cough. Other general physiology that influences the pathophysiology and management of chronic cough in children compared with adults includes differences in cognitive function and ability to self-express. </p><p>The differences between the pathophysiology of chronic cough in children compared with adults are exemplified in child-specific diagnoses such as protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). Thus, it is not surprising that different strategies are required to evaluate and manage chronic cough in children compared with adults, manifested in different evidence-based guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1075018974\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathological cough</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upregulation of the cough reflex, resulting in increased cough</strong> &ndash; As the stimulus for cough is multimodal, a variety of stimuli or combination thereof can result in increased coughing. In children, the most common cause of cough is respiratory infections. The infections are associated with inflammatory mediators that stimulate the various nociceptors in the airway walls, thus activating the cough pathway. Studies in animal models suggest that the increased cough can be related to neuromodulation; some viruses likely induce plasticity in the cough neural pathways, sometimes causing the cough to persist after the infection is cleared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. While the cough reflex cannot be stimulated from some areas like the nasal mucosa, diseases in the area may sensitize the cough reflex in animals and in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Other possible mechanisms include enhancement of cough sensitivity through intrathoracic pressure effects, suggesting that cough may also perpetuate the chronic cough cycle through the intrathoracic pressure effects generated by cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Human neurocellular data describing mechanisms for increased coughing are scarce. The mechanisms underpinning chronic cough have been likened to that of chronic neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and increased neurogenic markers have been described in children with increased cough receptor sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In children, cough sensitivity is increased in conditions where chronic cough occurs, and the sensitivity tends to normalize when cough resolves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Thus, the concept of &quot;cough hypersensitivity&quot; as a mechanism for chronic cough is not relevant in children and should be avoided. In contrast, this concept is likely beneficial in adults where idiopathic cough is common and likely involves mechanisms similar to neuropathic pain, in which there are considerable differences between children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Similarly, the concept of &quot;urge to cough&quot; widely described in the adult literature is also not an issue in young children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Downregulation of the cough reflex, resulting in ineffectual cough</strong> &ndash; A variety of abnormalities that interfere with the cough reflex arc result in ineffectual cough (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113194 \">figure 1</a>). An abnormal afferent neural pathway, usually associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities, can result in decreased airway sensitivity and consequent silent aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], which can ultimately lead to chronic lung disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efferent limb of the cough pathway may be impaired by:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormalities in the airway (larynx or trachea), including tracheostomy or vocal cord palsy. This is because closure of the larynx is also required to generate intrathoracic pressure prior to the expulsive phase of cough. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormalities in the pump mechanism of respiration, ie, muscle (chest and diaphragm), and chest wall abnormalities. This includes weak respiratory muscles (eg, due to neuromuscular disease), which reduce both inspiratory and expiratory volumes and flow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduction in airway patency (eg, tracheomalacia, trachea stenosis), because this reduces expiratory airflow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diagnosis and management of ineffectual cough is an important component of respiratory care in people with the above abnormalities, particularly those with neurodevelopmental or neuromuscular abnormalities.

Our approach is outlined in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691 \">algorithm 1</a>) and detailed in the following sections. This algorithm is similar to the guideline from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], which was shown to improve clinical outcomes in a multicenter randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], and is the best validated among several similar algorithmic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Remaining uncertainties about this and other algorithms are whether testing or management should depend on the duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of chronic cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>], and the age at which adult guidelines should be used. </p><p>The approach outlined below is designed for use in all patients up to 18 years of age. However it is also reasonable to use adult guidelines and algorithms for adolescents 15 years and older, consistent with the ACCP guidelines, since the etiologies of chronic cough in adolescents are fairly similar to those in adults.

The information obtained is then used to categorize the cough as specific (ie, underlying disease likely present) or nonspecific (no evidence of an underlying disease, so the cough is more likely to resolve spontaneously) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, the history of a prior response to medication needs to be interpreted with great caution since cough symptoms can spontaneously remit. Previous response to antibiotics and asthma therapies should be interpreted with special caution, as the antibiotics may have been prescribed for a self-limited viral illness, and the cough may have resolved spontaneously regardless of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Any current medications also should be reviewed carefully; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are well-established causes of chronic cough. A history of exposure to medications should be sought, particularly cytotoxic drugs, which are associated with interstitial lung disease; or immunosuppressive medications such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, which are associated with increased risk for pulmonary infections, including with fungal and mycobacterial pathogens.

Normal spirometry does not exclude disease, but abnormalities in spirometry values indicate specific cough (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>); in one study all patients with abnormal spirometry were ultimately found to have a specific cause of cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. An obstructive pattern in the spirometry indicates obstructive airway disease such as asthma or suppurative lung disease, while a restrictive pattern reflects an interstitial or chest wall restrictive processes. However, suboptimal effort on the part of the child will also result in a restrictive picture; thus, spirometry should be conducted by a technician proficient in testing children.</p><p>If an obstructive pattern is seen on the expiratory flow-volume loop, airway reversibility should be assessed by measuring forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV<sub>1</sub>) before and after inhalation of beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist. A positive response to bronchodilators establishes the presence of airway reactivity and is suggestive of asthma but does not rule out other disorders. As an example, children with cystic fibrosis often respond to bronchodilators. Abnormalities on the inspiratory loop correlate with extrathoracic airway obstruction, more often associated with stridor than cough.

Most cases of nonspecific cough are related to a viral illness (postviral cough) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; the underlying physiology is thought to be due to increased sensitivity that gradually resolve over time (two to four weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1075018974\" class=\"local\">'Pathological cough'</a> above). One study showed that most such children are very unlikely to have underlying disease (negative likelihood ratio 0, 95% CI 0-0.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Therefore, if the cough is troublesome, it is reasonable to perform an empiric trial of bronchodilators (short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists) or low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (&lt;400 micrograms <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> equivalent daily). High doses of inhaled corticosteroids should be avoided. If empiric treatment is undertaken, the trial should be time-limited (two to four weeks), and the medication should not be given chronically unless the underlying diagnosis is firmly established.

Nonetheless, in selected children with nonspecific cough and other symptoms suggestive of GERD (such as heartburn or regurgitation), it is reasonable to do an empiric trial of treatment for GERD for four weeks, using acid suppressing medications such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Similarly, a guideline for adults advises a trial of PPIs only in patients with heartburn or regurgitation symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], although in the past PPIs were often used as empiric treatment for adults with chronic cough. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">codeine</a> or other antitussive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dextromethorphan</a>) for the treatment of cold-related cough in children. They have potential harms with no proven benefit.

However, ascribing etiologies for the cough based on treatment trials has an inherent high risk of bias related to the placebo and &quot;period effects&quot; (the natural resolution of cough over time, which is evident in cough-related intervention studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]). Thus, when the cough resolves, a trial of ceasing the medications should be undertaken. If the chronic cough relapses, the medication could be recommenced, typically with further investigation to confirm the provisional diagnosis of asthma or GERD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If formally assessing response to therapy, child-specific assessment tools are required in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/17,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,61</a>], as the adult assessment tools have limited applicability in children.

A number of studies have documented the frequent consultations by parents of children with chronic cough, with three quarters consulting a doctor more than five times for their child's cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>].

This significant burden and worry for parents should be considered and they should be counseled appropriately about the prognosis and expected course for their child, in particular the excellent prognosis and outcome for children with chronic nonspecific cough. Amongst other issues, this parental worry can lead to the use of nonspecific medications, which may not be suitable due to lack of efficacy and safety concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cough suppressants</strong> &ndash; Over-the-counter cold and cough suppressants are <strong>not</strong> recommended for the treatment of chronic cough in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. There is no evidence that they improve symptoms in this age group, and significant safety concerns have been raised about their use in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

In addition, we recommend against the use of opioid drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">codeine</a> that may be effective in suppressing cough as evidence is limited and these drugs are associated with serious side effects and the potential for abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of tobacco smoke</strong> &ndash; There is evidence that environmental exposure to tobacco smoke increases respiratory infections and thus the risk for chronic cough in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Parents who smoke should be counseled to stop smoking and guided to support for smoking cessation. Until the parent is able to completely stop smoking, they should not smoke in the presence of children, including in the family car, even with the window open.

The term &quot;specific cough&quot; refers to a chronic cough that is ultimately attributable to an underlying physiologic cause. Conversely, &quot;nonspecific cough&quot; is defined as a chronic cough that does not have an identifiable cause after a reasonable evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H937094814\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common causes of specific cough in children include suppurative lung disease and other chronic infections (eg, protracted bacterial bronchitis [PBB], bronchiectasis, recurrent aspiration, pertussis, and mycoplasma) and cough-dominant asthma. Other important causes include foreign body aspiration and tuberculosis. Less common causes include congenital anomalies, neoplasia, or psychogenic processes, and rarely other nonpulmonary processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113206 \">table 1</a>). The frequency of each cause depends upon&nbsp;the clinical setting and population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic cough in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All children with chronic cough should be systematically evaluated including a detailed targeted history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and spirometry (when possible). (See <a href=\"#H187267916\" class=\"local\">'Algorithmic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and signs that are highly predictive of a specific cough (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>) include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic wet or productive cough, wheeze, onset after a choking episode, chest pain, hemoptysis, recurrent pneumonia, hypoxia, exertional dyspnea, associated cardiac, immunological or neurologic abnormalities, failure to thrive, or feeding difficulties. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormalities on physical exam such as chest wall deformities, digital clubbing, wheezing, rhonchi or crepitations, and hypoxemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal chest radiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spirometry. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of these specific cough pointers narrow the diagnostic possibilities and call for further specific testing or referral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2785066464\" class=\"local\">'Specific cough pointers present'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptom of a chronic wet cough in a young child usually indicates PBB or other suppurative lung disease. Children with suspected PBB should be treated with antibiotics, selected based on the likely underlying bacteria, local antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns, and the child's history of antibiotic use. (See <a href=\"#H2757153771\" class=\"local\">'Wet or productive cough'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-cough-in-children#H1374505933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic cough in children&quot;, section on 'Chronic endobronchial suppurative disease'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chronic cough that first began after an episode of choking, or that began suddenly while eating or playing (especially in a preschool-aged child), suggests the possibility of foreign body aspiration. (See <a href=\"#H1233587460\" class=\"local\">'Suspicion of retained foreign body'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A provisional diagnosis of nonspecific cough can be made if no features of specific cough are identified on the initial evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113208 \">table 2</a>). By definition, nonspecific cough is dry and nonproductive, and the chest radiograph and spirometry (if performed) are normal. (See <a href=\"#H4209352223\" class=\"local\">'No specific cough pointers (nonspecific cough)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with nonspecific cough, a &quot;wait, reassess, and review&quot; approach is recommended, as medications are generally not efficacious for nonspecific cough and there is a high likelihood that the cough will resolve spontaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113691\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113691 \">algorithm 1</a>). If medications are trialed, a reassessment is recommended in two to four weeks, which is the expected time to response for most medications. Cough that has not resolved with treatment trials necessitate further investigations and likely requires referral to a pulmonologist. (See <a href=\"#H424159479\" class=\"local\">'Nonspecific cough'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend NOT treating chronic cough with over-the-counter cough suppressants or other nonprescription cough medicines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). There is no evidence that they are effective, and there are safety concerns. (See <a href=\"#H3001522388\" class=\"local\">'Other management considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exacerbating factors for cough such as environmental tobacco smoke or allergens should be sought and addressed. The clinician should also evaluate the impact of the cough on the child and the family, and discuss the parents' concerns and expectations, to facilitate communication and appropriate counseling. (See <a href=\"#H4226777552\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3001522388\" class=\"local\">'Other management considerations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2575228808\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Roni Grad, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-chronic-cough-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Irwin RS.
