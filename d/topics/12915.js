Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS) is an alternative term used to refer to PNP. This latter term reflects the inclusion of the nonbullous cutaneous eruptions and pulmonary involvement that may develop in the setting of PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment of PNP will be discussed here. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pemphigus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pemphigus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22393525\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is well-accepted that PNP is a rare disorder, the incidence and prevalence of PNP are unknown. The rarity of the disorder is supported by a review of 100,000 adverse events reports to the US Food and Drug Administration from patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The review identified only 12 patients who likely had the disease. </p><p>Adults between the ages of 45 and 70 years constitute the most common demographic affected by PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the disorder may also occur in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Both males and females may be affected. Clear racial, ethnic, or geographic differences in the risk for PNP have not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22393532\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNP occurs in association with a variety of neoplastic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a review of 163 cases of PNP reported between 1990 and 2003, the frequency of associated conditions was as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (39 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (18 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Castleman's disease (18 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoma (9 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thymoma (6 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoma (6 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia (1 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hodgkin lymphoma, monoclonal gammopathy, and melanoma (each &lt;1 percent)</p><p/><p>As illustrated in this study, lymphoproliferative diseases account for the vast majority of disorders associated with PNP. The sarcomas detected in patients with PNP include liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, and malignant nerve sheath tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Rare patients have tumors that are too poorly differentiated to define; these tumors are usually retroperitoneal and often have the characteristics of follicular dendritic cell sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The distribution of PNP-associated neoplastic disorders may differ between children and the general population of patients with PNP. Castleman's disease is likely the most common associated disease in children. In a series of 14 children and adolescents with PNP, Castleman's disease was present in 12 patients (86 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The time course for the development of PNP in relation to the underlying neoplastic disorder varies. In two-thirds of patients, the discovery of the neoplastic disorder precedes PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In our experience, the peak time for the development of PNP in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is two to three years after diagnosis of the lymphoma. Although as many as 40 years have elapsed between Castleman's disease and the subsequent development of PNP, an interval of this length is highly unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Occasionally, the underlying neoplastic disorder is not identified prior to the death of the patient. In a series of 104 patients with clinical and immunologic findings consistent with PNP, 12 patients had no detectable tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22393585\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several theories on the connection between neoplasms and PNP have been proposed. In general, it appears that the neoplastic process induces an autoimmune disorder in which both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses play significant roles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. In an individual patient, the degree to which each type of immune response contributes to PNP may influence the clinical presentation of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H337049\"><span class=\"h2\">Humoral immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies against multiple epithelial antigens have been detected in PNP. The primary antigenic targets are desmoplakins, intracellular proteins that play an integral role in the anchoring of intermediate filaments to desmosomal plaques and in epidermal cell adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The detection of antibodies against two desmoplakins (periplakin and envoplakin) are the most specific laboratory findings in PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H403244761\" class=\"local\">'Other studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Serum from affected patients can also contain antibodies against desmoplakin I, desmoplakin II, epiplakin, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1, plectin, and the protease inhibitor alpha-2-macroglobulin-like-1 (A2ML1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Antibodies against desmoglein 3, a desmosomal protein targeted in pemphigus vulgaris, have also been identified in patients with PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, rare cases of PNP in which antibodies against laminin 332 were detected in patients with follicular dendritic cell sarcoma have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pemphigus#H181679704\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pemphigus&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1550860\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibody production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathways that lead to the production and deposition of antibodies in the skin and mucous membranes in PNP are not well understood. Proposed mechanisms include the stimulation of antibody production by tumor-induced immune dysregulation as well as the occurrence of cross-reactivity between antibodies directed against tumor cells and epithelial antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Epitope spreading, a phenomenon in which tissue injury leads to the exposure of antigens normally hidden from the immune system, may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In such cases, a cutaneous cytotoxic or inflammatory reaction induced by the tumor could result in the immune detection of intracellular antigens in desmosomes and hemidesmosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>]. </p><p>Although some authors have proposed that in certain lymphoproliferative disorders, antibody production by B lymphocytes may contribute to the development of PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], the relatively long period required for PNP resolution after the resection of Castleman's tumors (5 to 10 months) and the association of PNP with other malignancies, such as retroperitoneal sarcomas, reduce support for this concept as a major pathogenic mechanism. Moreover, in PNP related to Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia, an IgM myeloma, the autoantibodies detected are polyclonal antibodies of the IgG class. This finding suggests an alternative source for antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1550867\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have sought to clarify which antibodies, if any, are truly pathogenic in PNP. Although antibody deposition could stimulate the local recruitment of inflammatory cells and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibodies against epidermal components could also form as a secondary event following epidermal injury. A pathogenic role for antienvoplakin, antiperiplakin, and antidesmoglein 3 antibodies is suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antienvoplakin and antiperiplakin antibodies can induce dissociation of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels of antienvoplakin and antiperiplakin antibodies decreased as clinical improvement occurred following surgical removal of Castleman's tumors or thymoma in one small study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of antidesmoglein 3 antibodies from serum taken from PNP patients prior to the injection of the serum into neonatal mice prevented the development of blisters in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>However, the contribution of these and other antibodies to the development of PNP remains uncertain. In particular, antidesmoglein 3 antibodies have not been essential for the induction of PNP in other animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and normally, desmoglein 3 is not expressed by pulmonary epithelium, which can be affected in PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in one mouse model of PNP, lung inflammation produced ectopic expression of desmoglein 3 in the pulmonary epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H337056\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell-mediated immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of cellular infiltrates and features consistent with interface or lichenoid dermatitis in tissue specimens taken from patients with PNP suggests that cellular immunity contributes to this disorder. In support of this concept, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CD56+ natural killer cells, and CD68+ monocytes and macrophages have been detected at the epidermal-dermal junction in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that promotes lymphocyte maturation, cytotoxic T cell activation, and antibody production, have been detected in patients with PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Increased local production of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has also been reported in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Additional support for a role for cell-mediated immunity stems from the observation that cell-mediated cytotoxic reactions are seen in other skin diseases that clinically and histopathologically resemble PNP. Cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, lichen planus, and erythema multiforme can be difficult to distinguish clinically from PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7465407\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>A cell-mediated immune reaction in the skin and mucous membranes may contribute to the stimulation of the humoral immune system. Inflammation-induced damage to the basal layer of the epithelium could result in the immune recognition of normally hidden epithelial antigens through epitope spreading. (See <a href=\"#H1550860\" class=\"local\">'Antibody production'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7465407\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, PNP is characterized by the following mucocutaneous and systemic features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe erosive stomatitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphous skin lesions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoreticular or other malignancies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary involvement with features of bronchiolitis obliterans (may or may not be present) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H337101\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucosal lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erosive, painful mucositis is uniformly present in patients with PNP, and in its absence, the diagnosis should not be considered. Oral involvement is most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>], and patients develop a painful, erosive stomatitis that characteristically includes involvement of the tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59594%7EDERM%2F79518%7EDERM%2F54382\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59594 graphicRef79518 graphicRef54382 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Oral erosions are the initial disease manifestation in almost one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Other potential sites of mucosal involvement include the nasopharynx, conjunctiva, and anogenital area. Occasionally, lesions develop on the mucosal surfaces of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, or colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>Mucosal involvement may lead to significant side effects. The pain associated with oral mucosal disease often inhibits oral intake, contributing to malnutrition. Conjunctival involvement may lead to cicatrizing conjunctivitis, damage to the cornea, and visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H337116\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous lesions typically develop after the onset of mucosal lesions. The morphology of the cutaneous eruption is highly variable. Patients may present with bullae resembling the flaccid bullae of pemphigus vulgaris or the tense bullae of bullous pemphigoid, inflammatory violaceous papules or plaques resembling lichen planus or graft-versus-host disease, targetoid lesions similar to those of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or extensive cutaneous desquamation resembling toxic epidermal necrolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67265%7EDERM%2F79192%7EDERM%2F62146\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67265 graphicRef79192 graphicRef62146 \">picture 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/8,10,14,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,14,34</a>]. The cutaneous lesions of patients who develop PNP following treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may lack blistering and have more of a lichenoid or erythema multiforme-like appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>More than one lesion type may occur simultaneously in individual patients. Less common cutaneous manifestations include psoriasiform, pustular, and vegetative lesions, as well as the development of alopecia or palmoplantar or periungual involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/6,11,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H337139\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PNP may develop a life-threatening restrictive bronchiolitis consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans. The frequency with which pulmonary involvement occurs is not well-defined. In one retrospective study of 17 patients with PNP, restrictive bronchiolitis was detected in three patients (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In contrast, in a series of 28 patients with PNP related to Castleman's disease, pulmonary involvement was detected in 26 of 28 patients (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Bronchiolitis obliterans usually occurs late in the course of the disease, and is heralded by the development of shortness of breath that is out of proportion to changes visualized on chest imaging. An obstructive pattern is evident on pulmonary function tests, and CT scans may demonstrate patchy or diffuse air trapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The mechanism through which pulmonary damage occurs is not definitively known. Acantholysis, mixed inflammatory infiltrates, and antibody deposition have been detected in pulmonary epithelium in PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It has been suggested that pulmonary involvement results from the immune targeting of plakin proteins in the bronchial epithelium, resulting in detachment of cells and the occlusion of the distal alveolar sacs by cellular debris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CD8+ T lymphocytes may play an important role in pulmonary injury; a panmural infiltrate composed of CD8+ T lymphocytes was detected in a post-mortem examination of pulmonary tissue from a patient with PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Antibodies against epiplakin may be markers for pulmonary involvement in PNP. In a series of 48 patients with PNP in Japan, antibodies against epiplakin were more prevalent in patients with associated bronchiolitis obliterans than patients without this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The finding that passive transfer of antiepiplakin antibodies into mice produces inflammatory changes in small airway epithelia suggests a possible pathogenic role for antiepiplakin antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938432\"><span class=\"h2\">Other organs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody deposition was detected in muscle, bladder, and renal glomeruli in a study of three patients with PNP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, evidence for organ dysfunction related to these findings was not identified in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7465423\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135452255\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the variability in the clinical findings of PNP and the similarities between PNP and other disorders, the combined assessment of clinical and laboratory findings is necessary to establish the diagnosis. The key clinical findings that suggest PNP are the development of a painful erosive mucositis and polymorphous skin eruption in the setting of neoplastic disease. The laboratory studies used to support the diagnosis include light microscopy, direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIF), and serologic studies that detect antibodies against epidermal proteins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-cutaneous-blisters#H4714325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic tests'</a>.)</p><p> Our standard laboratory work-up for patients with suggestive clinical findings is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lesional skin or mucosal biopsy for light microscopy (typically a 4 mm punch biopsy) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A perilesional punch biopsy specimen from skin or mucosa for DIF (specimen must not be placed in formalin) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum for indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) studies on monkey esophagus and rat bladder epithelium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antienvoplakin and antiperiplakin antibodies</p><p/><p>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting are additional serologic tests that have been utilized for the diagnosis of PNP. However, the availability of these tests is limited and these studies are not typically utilized in the clinical setting. </p><p>Careful correlation of the clinical and laboratory findings is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of PNP because the histologic findings of PNP are not pathognomonic, and immunofluorescence studies and ELISA testing are sometimes negative. In particular, in patients who develop PNP after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, autoantibodies may not be detectable in the epidermis or serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>The laboratory studies used for the diagnosis of PNP are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H653919\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common histopathologic findings in PNP are suprabasal acantholysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72907\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72907 \">picture 3</a>), keratinocyte necrosis, and a lichenoid interface dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40</a>]. However, the histopathologic findings vary, often resembling other disorders that have similar clinical features (see <a href=\"#H337116\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous lesions'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For example, while acantholysis is typically a prominent feature in lesions that resemble pemphigus vulgaris, specimens taken from patients with tense bullae that resemble bullous pemphigoid may exhibit subepidermal clefting. Epidermal dyskeratosis, vacuolization of basal keratinocytes, and a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate are often found in cutaneous lesions that resemble lichen planus, erythema multiforme, or graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-pemphigus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Since the histologic findings overlap with multiple other disorders, correlation with the clinical scenario and other laboratory tests is important for diagnosis.

Oral mucosal lesions must be differentiated from chemotherapy-associated mucositis and the multiple other blistering disorders that may affect mucosal surfaces (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-cutaneous-blisters#H32804576\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters&quot;, section on 'Mucous membrane involvement'</a>).

Although similar mucocutaneous lesions may occur in erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, the acute nature of these disorders (improvement usually attained within three to five weeks) distinguishes them from PNP.

(See <a href=\"#H22393585\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies against periplakin and envoplakin are strongly associated with PNP. A pathogenic role for these and the multiple other antibodies detected in patients with PNP remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H22393585\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of PNP vary widely. Mucosal involvement occurs in all patients, with oral involvement being the most common site for involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59594%7EDERM%2F79518%7EDERM%2F54382\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59594 graphicRef79518 graphicRef54382 \">picture 1A-C</a>). The most common cutaneous manifestations are flaccid or tense bullae, lichenoid papules or plaques, targetoid lesions, and erosions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67265%7EDERM%2F79192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67265 graphicRef79192 \">picture 2A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7465407\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A restrictive bronchiolitis consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans occurs in a minority of patients with PNP. Pulmonary involvement can be life-threatening. (See <a href=\"#H337139\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PNP shares clinical and pathologic features with multiple other disorders. Confirmation of a diagnosis of PNP requires the correlation of clinical, pathologic, and immunologic studies. (See <a href=\"#H7465423\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H337194\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are limited on therapies for PNP. Surgical removal of the underlying tumor can be beneficial in patients with Castleman's disease or thymoma, but is much less likely to be of value for other malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H7465430\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with PNP, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If this is not effective, additional therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and intravenous immunoglobulin can be added as adjunctive therapy.
