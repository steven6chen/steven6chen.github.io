In the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, the new viruses contained components of previous human as well as avian influenza viruses. The origin of the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic, which killed more people in a single year than the bubonic plague, remains uncertain, but it appears to have been an adapted avian influenza strain. The emergence of a novel H1N1 human-swine-avian reassortant virus in 2009 in North America started a new pandemic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic transmission of avian influenza H5N1 to more than 850 humans since 2003 has prompted concerns that conditions are suitable for emergence of the next pandemic; the case-fatality rate is approximately 53 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, seroprevalence studies have found that some exposed individuals may have had a subclinical or mild infection, suggesting that the reported case-fatality rate may be an overestimate.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of H5N1 avian influenza will be reviewed here. The possible role of avian influenza vaccines, and the epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of avian influenza are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avian-influenza-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Avian influenza vaccines&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of avian influenza&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-avian-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of avian influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus that emerged in 2013 in China is also presented separately.

H5N1 viruses isolated in Thailand and Vietnam have amino acid substitutions within the M2 protein that confer resistance to amantadine and rimantadine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, these viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An analysis of a registry that included 308 human cases of H5N1 influenza from 12 countries suggested that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mortality benefit was greatest when treatment was started within the first two days following symptom onset, but some benefit persisted for up to six to eight days following symptom onset. In a later registry analysis, the case-fatality rate among patients who received treatment &le;2 days after symptom onset was 18 versus 63 percent for those receiving treatment later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, early initiation of oseltamivir was particularly effective in individuals without respiratory failure. Patients who required ventilatory support at the time of oseltamivir initiation were more likely to die from the episode of H5N1 influenza infection than patients who did not. In another study of H5N1 influenza infections in children, there was an increased risk of death for each day of delay in initiating oseltamivir (odds ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.17-2.61) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The optimal dose and duration of antiviral therapy for H5N1 influenza have not been established. In an animal study, mice were given various doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> four hours before inoculation with a H5N1 variant strain that had been isolated from a patient with fatal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Mice who were treated for eight days had significantly improved survival rates in all dose ranges compared with animals that only received five days of treatment. Prior animal studies had demonstrated that five days of oseltamivir was effective against another H5N1 variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the above study suggested that this specific avian strain may be more pathogenic than others previously tested and that virulence may be a factor in determining treatment duration and dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Experimental regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive immunotherapy could be a potential adjunct to antiviral treatments as critically ill patients infected with H5N1 influenza have responded after infusion of convalescent human plasma containing neutralizing H5N1 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A purified equine immunoglobulin F (FBF001) raised against <span class=\"nowrap\">A/Vietnam/2004</span> H5N1 influenza virus has been shown to have neutralizing activity against a broad range of heterologous H5N1 strains in vitro<em> </em>and in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The FBF001 antibody was tested in healthy adult humans and found to be well tolerated and capable of inducing neutralizing antibody against H5N1 influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>An experimental treatment for H5N1 influenza that has been tested in mice involves the use of H5-specific monoclonal antibodies that are capable of broadly neutralizing a range of H5 influenza viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin fragments that can neutralize both avian and human influenza A viruses have also been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>].</p><p>Another experimental approach involves the use of nanobodies that target H5N1 hemagglutinin; nanobodies are single-domain immunoglobulins engineered from the antibodies of camelids composed only of heavy chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When administered intranasally to mice prior to a lethal challenge of H5N1 influenza virus, nanobodies derived from llamas reduced virus replication in the lungs and reduced morbidity and mortality. When given after a lethal challenge of H5N1 influenza, nanobody therapy reduced viral replication in the lungs and delayed the time to death.</p><p>Because of the sporadic nature of H5N1 influenza infections, clinical evaluation of immunotherapeutic approaches, in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>, will require multicenter international collaborations.</p><p>An approach that has been proposed for optimizing the use of limited supplies of antivirals during a pandemic involves combining <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> in order to reduce renal clearance of the former drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a pharmacokinetic study of oseltamivir prophylaxis in humans, alternate daily dosing of oseltamivir in combination with probenecid (four times a day) resulted in adequate trough concentrations of the active metabolite of oseltamivir to achieve neuraminidase inhibition in vitro.</p><p>Another potential treatment strategy involves the use of an intravenous formulation of a neuraminidase inhibitor, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a>, but neither agent has been approved for the treatment of H5N1 influenza by the US Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Other investigational agents for the treatment of influenza are discussed separately.

These guidelines were updated in August 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The following recommendations were based on small observational case series, data in animal models, and controlled trials of seasonal influenza:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with confirmed or highly suspected avian influenza, treatment should be initiated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> since it has proven benefit against human seasonal influenza infection and may decrease viral shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although the efficacy of oseltamivir for H5N1 influenza has not been assessed in clinical trials, limited data have suggested a possible mortality benefit when compared with no antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Oseltamivir should be administered as early as possible but should be initiated even in patients who present late because viral replication is more prolonged than with uncomplicated seasonal influenza (for which only early therapy is indicated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Inactivated H5N2 and H5N3 vaccines prevent signs of infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses and decrease virus shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-avian-influenza/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, since standardization and potency testing of agricultural vaccines are not rigorous, the use of suboptimal or subpotent vaccines in birds that protect against clinical illness, but do not reduce virus shedding and excretion, may become a significant concern. The persistence of undetected H5 infection in a partially immune flock may accelerate virus evolution and pose threats to human health.</p><p>Vaccine for widespread clinical use may not be available until six to eight months after the emergence of a novel virus, leaving influenza antiviral agents as a first response.
