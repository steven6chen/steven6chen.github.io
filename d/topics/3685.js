Cardiac and pulmonary problems are usually the focus of the initial diagnostic evaluation. After these areas are excluded, other conditions affecting the structures in and around the thoracic cage enter into the differential diagnosis, including diseases of the esophagus, upper abdomen, head, neck, and chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the clinical evaluation of chest pain of musculoskeletal origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79217 \">table 1</a>).

As an example, a history of repetitive or unaccustomed activity involving the upper trunk or arms is common in the patient with musculoskeletal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of chest pain should be undertaken in the context of the patient&rsquo;s age, sex, family history, other coronary risk factors, and additional elements of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> general health. In middle-aged or older patients or in those with other risk factors for coronary artery disease, a cardiac source should always be considered first, since patients with a known cardiac source of chest pain may also have chest wall tenderness that reproduces their pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain occurs more frequently among women than men. One study examined the incidence of musculoskeletal chest pain in 122 consecutive patients presenting with chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of 36 patients diagnosed with costochondritis, 69 percent were women. By comparison, women represented only 31 percent of those presenting with chest pain but without a subsequent diagnosis of costochondritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics of the chest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Musculoskeletal chest pain is often insidious and persistent, lasting for hours to days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is frequently sharp and localized to a specific area (such as the xiphoid, lower rib tips, or midsternum), but it may be diffuse and poorly localized. Most chest wall pain is positional and is exacerbated by deep breathing, turning, or arm movement. These associations, however, are also noted in a variety of visceral processes, particularly those involving the pleura and pericardium. Localization of pain, in particular, is not helpful in differentiating musculoskeletal chest pain from chest pain due to other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Certain characteristics of the chest pain or associated symptoms may suggest a non-musculoskeletal origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77753 \">table 3</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation to the neck or arms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain localized to atypical areas such as the axilla or midthoracic spine</p><p/><p>One large study, done in an outpatient primary care setting, showed that four determinants (localized muscle tension, stinging pain, pain reproducible by palpation, and absence of cough) were associated with a diagnosis of chest wall syndrome (noninflammatory musculoskeletal chest wall pain associated with local or regional tenderness, such as costosternal or costochondral pain syndromes) with 63 percent sensitivity and 79 percent specificity when two or more of these were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other musculoskeletal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of musculoskeletal symptoms in areas other than the chest may alert the clinician to a possible musculoskeletal cause. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the neck, thoracic spine, or even the shoulder may cause pain referred to the chest wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of chronic low back pain (particularly in a younger patient with morning stiffness) may suggest ankylosing spondylitis or another spondyloarthropathy which frequently involves the chest wall. A history of ocular inflammation (uveitis, conjunctivitis), psoriasis, or other skin lesions may also be a clue to the presence of a spondyloarthropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with sleep disturbance and fatigue is suggestive of fibromyalgia.

In addition, careful attention to the skin may reveal lesions (sometimes not mentioned by the patient) associated with specific musculoskeletal chest wall syndromes, such as psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, or dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Symptoms of conjunctivitis or uveitis are usually obvious to the patient and are confirmed by examination, but a brief ocular examination should be performed in patients with symptoms of photophobia or redness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59998 \">table 4</a>)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general musculoskeletal examination should begin with an assessment for mobility of the cervical spine and shoulders. The lumbar spine should then be examined for range of motion, particularly any deficit in forward flexion that might suggest ankylosing spondylitis or one of the spondyloarthropathies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58884 \">figure 1</a>). Discomfort in the posterior pelvic girdle from sacroiliitis should also be sought by compression of the anterior iliac crests or by external rotation of the hip.</p><p>In the thoracic spine, tenderness or pain on motion is very suggestive of a musculoskeletal cause of chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Movement of the articulations of the ribs with the thoracic vertebrae (the costovertebral joints) should be assessed by measurement of chest expansion. Chest expansion is measured at the level of the fourth intercostal space, or just below the breasts in females. The patient is instructed to exert a maximal forced expiration followed by a maximal inspiration. The expansion is usually 5 cm or more; an expansion less than 2.5 cm is abnormal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An evaluation for &ldquo;tender points&rdquo; characteristic of fibromyalgia should be undertaken in patients with suspected musculoskeletal chest pain, particularly in those with a history of widespread musculoskeletal pain and a generally normal musculoskeletal examination. These tender areas are often found in places unsuspected by the patient and include points in the upper and mid-cervical spine, trapezius, upper scapular borders, lateral elbows, lateral gluteal, lateral trochanteric areas of the hips, and medial knees, in addition to the anterior third and fourth costochondral junctions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ribs and chest wall examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important diagnostic feature in musculoskeletal chest wall syndromes is chest wall tenderness that consistently reproduces the patient's pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/3,5,6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6,10</a>]. This finding is generally considered diagnostic for a chest wall syndrome. Many chest wall syndromes are defined on the basis of the location of areas of tenderness.</p><p>Examination of the ribs and chest wall begins with an assessment for areas of localized swelling, such as the sternoclavicular joints and upper costochondral junctions. The articulations at either end of the clavicle (acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints) should then be palpated. Along the course of the sternum in the midline, tenderness may be found beside the sternalis muscle, the manubriosternal and xiphisternal joints, or the xiphoid process. In addition, tenderness should be sought at the costochondral junctions along both sides of the sternum and over the lower rib tips laterally. In the posterior thorax, costovertebral joint dysfunction may be assessed by palpation over the areas just lateral to the vertebral bodies or over the affected rib.</p><p>In addition to direct palpation, various maneuvers have been utilized to reproduce chest wall pain. These include the &ldquo;crowing rooster&rdquo; maneuver, horizontal arm flexion, and the &ldquo;hooking&rdquo; maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &ldquo;crowing rooster&rdquo; maneuver is done with the clinician standing behind the patient and exerting traction on the upper arms by pulling them backward and slightly superiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80833 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In horizontal arm flexion, the arm is flexed across the anterior chest and steady, prolonged traction is applied in a horizontal direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71579 \">figure 4</a>). Both horizontal arm flexion and the &ldquo;crowing rooster&rdquo; maneuver may be done at the same time as neck extension or rotation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &ldquo;hooking&rdquo; maneuver is done by hooking the fingers under the anterior costal margins and by pulling the rib cage anteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82160\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82160 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>As with palpation, findings with all three of these maneuvers should be considered diagnostic only if the patient&rsquo;s presenting pain is reproduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory and radiographic studies have three major purposes in the evaluation of a patient with suspected musculoskeletal chest wall pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60641 \">table 5</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To evaluate the patient&rsquo;s general health and to exclude cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal sources of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To determine whether a suspected chest wall syndrome might be associated with a specific rheumatic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To directly assess an anatomic area of the chest wall or surrounding structures</p><p/><p>In the young, healthy patient with pain of relatively short duration and with a normal general physical examination, the likelihood of an underlying visceral or systemic illness is low; laboratory and radiographic evaluation is, therefore, unlikely to be fruitful in this setting. By comparison, in older patients or in those with persistent pain, fever, cough, weight loss, abdominal symptoms, or chronic medical illnesses, visceral processes should be excluded before chest wall syndromes are considered.</p><p>The evaluation in such patients should consist of a complete blood count, routine chemistries (including serum creatinine concentration), urinalysis, a chest radiograph, and an electrocardiogram. A more complete evaluation for coronary disease is often indicated in patients with risk factors for coronary disease, even if the chest pain is atypical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most rheumatic diseases in which the chest wall is involved, the diagnosis is based upon the pattern of joint involvement outside the chest, extraarticular features, and laboratory abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60641 \">table 5</a>). As an example, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a relatively nonspecific test for inflammatory disease which is elevated in a majority of patients with septic arthritis, active rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other spondyloarthropathies. An elevated ESR is not as predictable in psoriatic arthritis or sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with unexplained arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint, an evaluation for rheumatoid factor is indicated, since some patients with rheumatoid arthritis present with an atypical, monoarticular pattern of arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with pain or stiffness in the lower or upper back, with evidence of sacroiliac tenderness, or with limited lumbar flexion or chest expansion on examination, radiographs of the sacroiliac joints are the initial step in evaluation for ankylosing spondylitis or another of the spondyloarthropathies. In most cases, irregularity, narrowing, or sclerosis will suggest sacroiliac inflammation. When sacroiliac films are equivocal, checking for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 may be useful in increasing or decreasing the likelihood of diagnosing these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with obvious swelling and erythema of an isolated joint (usually the sternoclavicular joint), aspiration and synovial fluid analysis should be attempted (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a>). In this uncommon situation, an infectious process should be the initial concern, and cultures should be the first studies obtained, with a cell count done on any remaining fluid. In patients with negative cultures and a strong suspicion for an infectious process, a repeat aspiration and cultures for atypical organisms, such as mycobacteria and fungi, should be obtained. Direct biopsy of areas of persistent swelling and tenderness may be necessary to definitively diagnose atypical infections or primary or metastatic neoplasms of the chest wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic studies of the chest wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiologic evaluation of the anterior chest wall in patients with different musculoskeletal disorders presents difficulties due to the anatomic complexity of the region complexity and the variability of the radiographic findings. The integrated use of plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear scintigraphy, and ultrasonography may be needed to fully define abnormalities and to allow for clinical correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In particular, imaging of the sternoclavicular joint may reveal findings characteristic of a number of different conditions that may be associated with musculoskeletal chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain radiographs</strong> &ndash; Plain radiographs of the ribs can detect localized tumors (primary or metastatic) or fractures; however, subsequent films may be needed in up to one-half of patients with fractures to confirm a diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scintigraphy</strong> &ndash; Nuclear scintigraphy may show increased uptake in involved areas in inflammatory syndromes, after trauma, or with tumors; these studies are usually normal with the common localized chest wall syndromes when not associated with a more generalized arthropathy. As a result, a positive bone scan in the rib cage area increases the possibility of ankylosing spondylitis, sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCCH), rheumatoid arthritis, or infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54771\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54771 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In addition, bone infarcts of the ribs may be seen in patients with chest pain in sickle cell crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Knowledge and experience in interpreting scintigraphy is essential in differentiating abnormal tracer uptake from variable areas of uptake seen in this area in asymptomatic healthy people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CT and MRI</strong> &ndash; CT is extremely useful in further characterizing lesions of the sternoclavicular joint or sternum and may be needed when a pulmonary or pleural-based lesion is suspected on clinical grounds. The multidetector CT scan (MDCT), using pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or coronary artery protocols, may be very useful in imaging of the musculoskeletal structures of the chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Important normal variants of the sternum and findings of osteoarthritis seen on CT need to be differentiated from findings of pathologic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Identification of an associated soft tissue mass is important in distinguishing destructive lesions due to infection or neoplasm from normal areas of cortical irregularity. The lesions of SCCH are seen earliest in the periosteal and ligamentous structures, with relative sparing of the sternoclavicular joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although several descriptions of MRI studies of the chest wall have been reported, the role of this technique has not been fully defined in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. MRI findings described in a series of patients with Tietze&rsquo;s syndrome include enlargement and thickening of cartilage at the site of complaint, focal or widespread increased signal intensities of affected cartilage on both T2 and short tau inversion recovery (STIR)-weighted images, bone marrow edema in the subchondral bone, and gadolinium uptake in cartilage and subchondral bone marrow. It is unclear whether these findings might be more characteristic of the closely related SCCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Erosive changes of the corners of vertebral bodies appear to be a consistent finding in patients with SCCH with vertebral involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Chest CT or MRI should be considered in patients with sternoclavicular joint infections to better define the extent of soft tissue involvement in nearby structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound study of the sternoclavicular joint has been evaluated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and SCCH and may be useful for the detection of synovitis, increased blood flow, erosions, and osteophytes in these joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of laboratory tests in a patient with an apparent musculoskeletal chest wall syndrome is directed by the history and physical exam.

Scintigraphy may be most useful in patients with diffuse pain and tenderness in whom ankylosing spondylitis or sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCCH) is suspected, or when an area of localized tenderness is found without swelling. Areas of localized swelling in the area of the sternoclavicular joint should be aspirated, and cell counts and cultures should be obtained. Other areas of localized swelling are best visualized by computed tomography (CT), with special attention to soft tissue and bony structures. One of these advanced imaging studies is also recommended if there is proven sternoclavicular joint infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480153\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of patients with an apparent musculoskeletal chest wall pain syndrome is directed by the history and physical exam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55901 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77753 \">table 3</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most rheumatic diseases in which the chest wall is involved, the diagnosis is based upon the pattern of joint involvement outside the chest, extraarticular features, and laboratory abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60641 \">table 5</a>). Healthy young patients with tender areas, but without swelling or other musculoskeletal or systemic findings, can usually be managed without any other further laboratory studies. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients or those with persistent pain, fever, cough, weight loss, abdominal symptoms, or chronic medical illnesses should have a complete blood count, routine chemistries, urinalysis, a chest radiograph, and an electrocardiogram. A more complete evaluation for coronary disease is often indicated in patients with risk factors for coronary disease, even if the chest pain is atypical. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The integrated use of different imaging studies may be needed to fully define abnormalities and to allow for clinical correlation because of the anatomic complexity of the region and the variability of the imaging findings. In particular, imaging of the sternoclavicular joint may reveal findings characteristic of a number of different conditions that may be associated with musculoskeletal chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies of the chest wall'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stochkendahl MJ, Christensen HW.
