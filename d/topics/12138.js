It often evolves from a spontaneously draining anorectal abscess. Perianal fistulous disease has significant implications for patient quality of life as sequelae range from minor pain and social hygienic embarrassment to frank sepsis. </p><p>The management of the anorectal fistula (also called fistula-in-ano) remains one of the most challenging and controversial topics in colorectal surgery. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy with the ultimate goal of draining local infection, eradicating the fistulous tract, and avoiding recurrence while preserving native sphincter function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The surgical approach depends on several factors, such as the etiology, location, type, and duration of the fistula, as well as previously performed procedures and preoperative sphincter function.</p><p>This topic will discuss surgical management of anorectal fistulas. The causes, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and classification of anal fistulas can be found elsewhere.

As such, most internal openings of the fistula are located around the anal glands surrounding the dentate line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Fistulas that occur between the anal orifice and the dentate line are referred to as anal in origin, while fistulas that originate above the dentate line are rectal in origin. Less commonly, fistulas can occur between the anal canal or rectum and the vagina or bladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urogenital-tract-fistulas-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urogenital tract fistulas in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The course of an anorectal fistula follows one of four paths: intersphincteric (45 percent), transsphincteric (30 percent), suprasphincteric (20 percent), or extrasphincteric (5 percent), before exiting at the perianal skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52917 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76507\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76507 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The following is the anatomical description of the anal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288679\"><span class=\"h2\">Anal canal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anal canal begins at the anorectal junction and ends at the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54523 \">figure 4</a>). The anal verge is demarcated at the site where the squamous epithelium lining of the lower anal canal becomes continuous with the skin of the perineum. Anteriorly, the middle third of the anal canal is attached by dense connective tissue to the perineal body, which separates it from the membranous urethra and penile bulb in males and from the lower vagina in females. Laterally and posteriorly, the anal canal is surrounded by loose adipose tissue within the ischiorectal fossas. Posteriorly, the anal canal is attached to the coccyx by the anococcygeal ligament, a midline fibroelastic structure that may possess some skeletal muscle elements and that runs between the posterior aspect of the middle portion of the external sphincter and the coccyx. Just above this is the raphe of the levator ani muscle, the fusion of the two halves of iliococcygeus, which merges anteriorly with the puborectalis muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288685\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischiorectal fossa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ischiorectal fossa is triangular in shape and bounded by the skin inferiorly, the obturator internus muscle laterally, and the inferior surface of the levator ani as its anterior and medial border. Posteriorly, the ischiorectal space is continuous to the sacrotuberous ligament and the gluteus maximus muscle with the potential space in the buttock deep to the muscle. Superiorly, the ischiorectal fossa is sealed off by the origin of the levator ani from the inner surface of the obturator internus and the continuity of the inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm with the obturator fascia. Anteriorly, the ischiorectal fossa is separated from the superficial perineal space by the attachment of the perineal fascia to the posterior border of the urogenital diaphragm. The ischiorectal fossa continues forward for a short distance above the urogenital diaphragm and the lower border of the pelvic diaphragm until these two diaphragms join. The left and right ischiorectal fossas communicate posteriorly, above a portion of the external anal sphincter that extends posteriorly to attach to the coccyx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63229 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288691\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal anal sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal anal sphincter is a well-defined ring of obliquely orientated smooth muscle fibers that is continuous with the circular muscle of the rectum and terminates at the junction of the superficial and subcutaneous components of the external sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>). The lower portion of the sphincter is crossed by fibers from the conjoint longitudinal tendon that pass into the submucosa of the lower canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288697\"><span class=\"h2\">External anal sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external anal sphincter is an oval, tube-shaped complex composed mainly of skeletal muscle fibers. The muscle consists of deep, superficial, and subcutaneous parts but should be considered as a single functional and anatomical entity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The uppermost fibers of the external anal sphincter blend with the lowest fibers of puborectalis muscle. The fibers from the upper third attach anteriorly into the superficial transverse perineal muscles, and posteriorly the fibers are attached to the anococcygeal raphe. The majority of the fibers of the middle third of the external anal sphincter surround the lower part of the internal sphincter. The middle third is attached anteriorly to the perineal body and posteriorly to the coccyx by the anococcygeal ligament. The fibers of the lower third of the muscle lie below the level of the internal anal sphincter and are separated from the lowest anal epithelium by the submucosa layer.</p><p>The transverse perinei and bulbospongiosus muscles fuse with the external sphincter in the lower part of the perineum. The perineal body attaches the external anal sphincter muscle to the surrounding structures and is an imbrication of muscle fibers in females in comparison to a central tendinous insertion in men. Also in females, the anterior and lateral portion of the external anal sphincter is significantly shorter and is oriented in a horizontal plane. In males, the external sphincter is more anular and is separate from the central point of the perineum, so that there is a surgical plane of cleavage between the external sphincter and perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288703\"><span class=\"h2\">Anal mucosa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upper part of the anal canal is lined by mucosa similar to the rectum, while the lower portion is lined by stratified epithelium similar to the skin of the perianal region. The line around the anal canal that can be traced by following the anal columns is the pectinate line (also called the dentate line or mucocutaneous line) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>). This line represents the change in epithelium as well as lymphatic drainage, blood supply, and venous drainage. The pectinate line is palpated or visualized approximately 2 cm above the anal opening. </p><p>At the junction of these two types of lining are the anal columns, longitudinal and wider at the distal end, while fading at the proximal end of the canal. They are united distally by thin membranes called anal valves. Between the bases of the longitudinal columns and the anal valves are anal sinuses, rudimentary anal glands (also called crypts or ducts), which open into the anal sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>). An infection of an anal sinus and gland can develop into an abscess. The abscess develops a fistula that can extend from the anal canal into the perianal musculature, the ischiorectal fossa, and the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288709\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288715\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate management and long-term success of treating the fistula begins with the first patient encounter in the surgeon's office or emergency room. The internal and external openings of the fistulous tract need to be identified. The external opening may be seen on external examination; the typical appearance is a small dimpled area of granulation tissue that drains pus or blood on manual compression. The internal opening may be identified by anoscopy with manual compression over the external opening. Proctoscopy is also indicated in the presence of rectal disease, such as Crohn disease or other suppurative conditions. </p><p>A digital rectal examination is performed on every patient to assess for an indolent or incompletely drained abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78125 \">figure 6</a>). In contrast, most patients will not tolerate even gentle probing of the fistula track in the office setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288721\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple imaging options for the evaluation of anorectal fistulas. The choice of which modality, if any, to implement is dependent on equipment availability, radiologist expertise, patient tolerance, cost, and the proposed management strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorectal-fistula-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-principles#H1062171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management principles&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>The anatomy of most fistulas can be determined in the operating room without preoperative imaging. If the internal openings and extent of sphincter involvement are difficult to identify, intraoperative radiographic studies can be helpful. We commonly use three-dimensional ultrasound intraoperatively to evaluate recurrent or complicated fistulas. Hydrogen peroxide can be used with this technique to outline the fistula tract. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116807742\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major postoperative risks of surgical management of anorectal fistulas include fecal incontinence and recurrences, which should be addressed when discussing treatment options. Fistulas located in the lateral position, complex fistulas, those with horseshoe extensions, and those with lack of identification of the internal opening have an increased risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of postoperative incontinence is higher with anterior fistulas in women, high anal fistulas, previous fistula surgery, and fistulotomy with or without setons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288727\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall goal of surgery is to eradicate the fistula, preserve anal sphincteric function, and prevent a recurrence. The tremendous variability of patient factors and the heterogeneity of anorectal fistulas require a greater need for surgical &quot;judgment&quot; than in most colorectal diseases.</p><p>While most cryptoglandular fistulas are treated surgically, combined medical and surgical therapy is required if the fistula is secondary to Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal complications of Crohn disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorectal-fistula-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457691535\"><span class=\"h2\">Staged approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If drainage persists beyond 6 to 12 weeks after the initial incision and drainage of an anorectal abscess or other septic process, an anorectal fistula is suspected, for which further surgery is indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116736\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116736 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, all patients suspected of a fistula undergo an examination under anesthesia to determine whether the fistula is simple or complex based on the extent of anal sphincter muscle involvement and other characteristics of the fistula. Patients with a simple fistula, who otherwise have no risk factor for incontinence, should undergo a primary fistulotomy (see <a href=\"#H22288745\" class=\"local\">'Simple fistulas'</a> below). Patients with a complex fistula, or who are at high risk for incontinence, should have a draining seton placed to preserve the sphincter mechanism and help eradicate the septic focus. In six or more weeks, a second sphincter-sparing procedure can be performed after drainage diminishes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116736\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116736 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22288751\" class=\"local\">'Complex fistulas'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288739\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure selected for an individual patient should be based on a thorough physical examination of the anal region. The key technical component of all operative procedures is the identification and curetting of the internal opening to ensure adequate drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. No single operative technique is appropriate for the treatment of all anorectal fistulas; hence, the judgment and experience of the surgeon must guide the treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. </p><p>The surgical management of the anorectal fistula depends on the location of the fistula in relation to the external anal sphincter (Parks' classification) and the amount of the sphincter complex involved with the fistulous tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52917 \">figure 2</a>). Clinical experience has shown that fistulotomy is an effective procedure for simple submucosal, intersphincteric, and low-sphincteric fistulas, while staged procedures are a better approach for complex fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288745\"><span class=\"h3\">Simple fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most fistulas are simple (minimal involvement of the external sphincter muscle) and classified as low-lying transsphincteric (Parks' type 2 and involving &lt;30 percent of anal sphincter complex) and intersphincteric fistulas (Parks' type 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56209 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The anal canal is gently dilated digitally, the pectinate line is visualized, and the anal crypts are examined for evidence of inflammation and an internal opening. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288787\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal opening identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The identification of the internal opening of the fistula is another key element common to all fistula procedures. Lack of identification of the internal opening is one reason for failure of any given technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Dilute hydrogen peroxide or dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> is infused via an angiocatheter into the external opening of the fistula while examining the anal canal with an anoscope.

The key technical component of all operative procedures is the identification and curetting of the internal opening to ensure adequate drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All procedures include dilatation of the anal canal and anoscopy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288799\"><span class=\"h2\">Fistulotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fistulotomy involves laying open the fistula tract in its entirety. It is an effective treatment for simple anal fistulas that results in healing in over 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. It is critical to assess all patients' incontinence score prior to fistulotomy. In patients with preexisting incontinence, fistulotomy is contraindicated in all situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116736\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116736 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288805\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A probe is inserted into the internal opening and gently passed along the fistula tract to the external opening. An incision is made over the entire length of the fistula using the probe as a guide. The tract is gently curetted, and an absorbable stitch is used to marsupialize the tract to promote healing. The wound is gently packed with a petroleum-based gauze and covered with a sterile dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. We prefer to marsupialize the tract as it may speed up wound healing. </p><p>The most critical step in this procedure is to identify and curette the internal opening to reduce the risk of recurrence. In a randomized trial of primary fistulotomy for perianal abscesses in 52 patients, persistent fistulas occurred in seven patients (25 percent) treated with incision and drainage compared to no recurrences in 24 patients treated with a fistulotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69997 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80548\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80548 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288811\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be observed for a minimum of six months following the procedure before determining a treatment failure or success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The most concerning potential complication of a fistulotomy is incontinence from procedure-related damage to the external anal sphincter. The divided muscle fibers retract, and the result is solid fecal, liquid fecal, or gas incontinence. The reported rates of incontinence are highly variable, ranging from 0 to 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Nevertheless, when fistulotomy is used for simple anal fistulas in properly selected patients, the risk of fecal incontinence is minimal or none [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Recurrence rates for an anorectal fistula treated with a fistulotomy are generally reported to be low, with success rates ranging from 79 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/19,22,24,25,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,24,25,27-30</a>]. In an observational study with median 76 months' follow-up, the three-year recurrence rate for 109 patients with a low-lying simple fistula treated was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288835\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURES FOR COMPLEX FISTULAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following procedures are used to treat complex fistulas. All procedures include dilatation of the anal canal, anoscopy, and identification of the internal opening. (See <a href=\"#H22288757\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative preparation'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288841\"><span class=\"h2\">Fistulotomy by snug setons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A snug seton, also referred to as a &quot;cutting&quot; seton, is a reactive suture or elastic that is placed through the fistula tract and tightened at regular intervals. It slowly cuts through the tract, causing scarring, thus preventing the wide disruption of the anal sphincter associated with fistulotomy. </p><p>By contrast, a noncutting or draining seton is a seton that is placed primarily for drainage. It does not cut through the sphincter. For complex fistulas, including those that traverse more than 30 percent of the sphincter, are proximal to the dentate line, or are high transsphincteric fistulas, draining setons are used at the time of the first operation to preserve the sphincter mechanism and help eradicate the septic focus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63341 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79569 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>For a snug seton to work properly, the skin bridge and subcutaneous tissue between the seton and muscle must be completely divided. A draining seton can be converted to a snug seton by incising those structures, allowing the seton to slowly migrate through the muscle over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288847\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal opening is identified and a probe inserted between the internal and external openings as previously described. The skin bridge is opened completely between the internal and external openings, and a small piece of braided silk or an elastic vessel loop is pulled through the fistulous tract. This seton is secured snugly around the sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63341 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p>Patients are examined at monthly intervals, and the seton is tightened until the deep space is obliterated. The suture promotes granulation tissue formation and allows the edges of the wound to become firm before the sphincter is divided. The seton will slowly divide the fistulous tissue tract on the leading edge of the seton while allowing healing to occur on the trailing edge, and preserving sphincter continuity and theoretically preserving sphincter function. Incontinence occurs not because the sphincter muscle is divided but when the muscle fibers retract and the space in between is filled with scar tissue.</p><p>There is a wide variation of times that snug setons remain in situ. Shortened periods between seton tightening may result in poor outcomes. From basic biology principles, significant collagen deposition and fibrosis occur over a period of four to six weeks, so setons that cut through more rapidly than this may not provide adequate time for scarring to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288853\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most important complications of a fistulotomy with a snug seton are recurrence and incontinence. The success rates for snug setons range from 82 to 100 percent; however, long-term incontinence rates can exceed 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/25,26,28,29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,28,29,32,33</a>]. </p><p>In one multicenter study, 200 consecutive patients had loose setons placed and exchanged regularly; all fistulas eventually cleared with a recurrence rate of 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, leaving draining setons indefinitely may result in low-grade incontinence of gas, mucous, or fluid discharge and have an adverse impact on quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>A retrospective analysis (n = 59) of the long-term results of a snug seton as a treatment for high cryptoglandular fistulas revealed primary and secondary healing rates of 93 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Normal or near-normal continence was maintained in 78 percent of patients; 13.5 and 8.5 percent of patients, respectively, developed moderate and severe incontinence. Mean continence score was significantly worse in women than men. </p><p>A randomized trial compared the risks of incontinence of a modified snug seton technique, which includes the repair of the internal anal sphincter and directing the seton through the intersphincteric space, with the conventional snug seton technique in 34 patients with high transsphincteric fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There was no significant difference in incontinence rates, resting anal manometric pressures, healing rates, or recurrence rates between the two techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288859\"><span class=\"h2\">Advancement flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endoanal and endorectal advancement flaps preserve the anal sphincter by closing off the internal opening of the fistula by a mobilized flap of healthy tissue consisting of mucosa and submucosa, with or without the internal sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The flap provides tissue coverage of tract internal opening and allows the tract to heal and close (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79234 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>Endoanal and endorectal advancement flaps are the preferred approach for complicated anorectal fistulas without coexisting incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Not all anorectal fistula patients are candidates for mucosal flap advancement. Very high fistulas, for example, are technically challenging to treat by this technique. Additionally, anal stenosis, active proctitis, and inflammatory bowel disease are relative contraindications due to high complication and failure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288865\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key component of this procedure is to create a flap that includes the mucosa, submucosa, and a portion of the circular muscular fibers that is sufficient to cover the internal opening.<strong> </strong>The base of the flap proximally should measure at least twice its width at the apex. The flap is raised by making a curvilinear incision around the dentate line. The incision should not extend more than one-third of the anal canal circumference to prevent stricture formation. If dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is used to control bleeding, care should be taken not to raise a flap that is too thin. A thin flap may result in ischemia and may not provide sufficient integrity to adequately cover the internal opening and prevent recurrence.</p><p>After the fistulous tract is curetted and debrided, the flap is advanced and sutured in place. We prefer to anchor the center and most cephalad portion of the underside of the flap first; then, the lateral portion of the flap is secured with a running or interrupted suture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288871\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of endoanal advancement flap techniques exist and, in experienced hands, have low-to-moderate recurrence rates (0 to 40 percent), depending in part on patient population, and tolerable incontinence rates ranging from 0 to 12.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/30,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,40-44</a>]. The wide range in outcomes is due to heterogeneity in patient populations, technique, and experience. </p><p>In a retrospective single-institution study, 58 of 98 patients underwent endorectal advancement flap for a cryptoglandular fistula and the rest for inflammatory bowel disease-associated fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. At 7&plusmn;3 years after surgery, primary healing occurred in 72 percent of patients; additional flaps or other treatment increased the overall healing rate to 93 percent. Patients with Crohn disease had lower healing rates than those with cryptoglandular fistulas (87 versus 98 percent).

A probe is inserted through the internal opening into the deep space abscess cavity. An incision is made in the posterior midline, initially avoiding the superficial external sphincter. The midline incision is then deepened parallel to and through the fibers of the superficial external sphincter, thereby unroofing the deep space for drainage. A probe is then guided through the internal opening to exit through the midline surgical incision. The walls of the deep space are inspected to identify limbs of the horseshoe abscess fistula.</p><p>If a deep post-anal abscess or extension into the ischiorectal fossa is identified, we prefer to use a modified Hanley technique for definitive management with draining lateral setons and a snug seton in the posterior midline.</p><p>A counterincision is made over the appropriate site with the subsequent incision, drainage, and curettage of all of the fistulous tracts. Next, the seton is attached to the midline probe and retrieved through the internal opening and secured to itself with a 0 silk suture. The underlying perianal skin and anoderm between the primary midline opening and the secondary midline surgical incision is removed to allow subsequent tightening of the seton. A Penrose drain is placed in the tract and removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288907\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a retrospective review of 23 patients with high transsphincteric horseshoe fistulas treated by a modified Hanley procedure using snug setons, 91 percent had complete healing within eight months, and no incontinence was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

A mixture of fibrinogen, thrombin, and calcium ions forms a clot that is injected into the fistula tract, and within 10 to 60 seconds the fistula is potentially sealed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. This approach avoids sphincter division, but long-term results have not been encouraging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54580 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180862187\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A catheter is typically inserted through the external opening and advanced to the internal opening. At the internal opening, a seal is created with fibrin, and then 2 to 5 mL of fibrin sealant is injected as the catheter is withdrawn. At the external opening, another plug is created, resulting in a dumbbell-shaped seal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3824599027\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recurrence rate for fistulas repaired with fibrin glue alone ranges from 14 to 69 percent, depending on the complexity of the fistula, duration of observation, and technical aspects, such as debridement of the fistulous openings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/17,18,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,50</a>]. </p><p>Fibrin sealant injections are occasionally used to treat complex fistulas. The main benefit is sphincter preservation. But overall it is not very effective.

It does not generate a foreign body reaction or necessitate disruption of the anal sphincter, and it eliminates the risk of sphincter dysfunction associated with other procedures, such as fistulotomy and setons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/12,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,51</a>]. The fistula plug was designed to ameliorate postoperative incontinence in high-risk fistula patients, such as fistulas with high internal openings, anterior fistulas, or those that transverse significant portions of sphincter muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68400\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68400 \">picture 5</a>). However, the use of fistula plugs, especially in high or complex fistulas, has waned due to reported low healing rates of &lt;50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288919\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If setons were previously placed in the fistula tract, they are left in place at the start of the operation to aid in visualizing the tract and subsequent fistula plug placement. (See <a href=\"#H22288841\" class=\"local\">'Fistulotomy by snug setons'</a> above.)</p><p>Once the anatomy of the fistula is confirmed, the fistula plug is prepared by immersion into isotonic saline. A 2-0 silk suture is introduced into the internal opening and pulled through the entire length of the fistula tract with the assistance of the previously placed silastic seton or a lacrimal probe. With the suture coursing through the fistula tract, the tapered end of the fistula plug is attached and the plug is pulled into the fistula from the internal opening toward the external opening until snug.</p><p>Excess fistula plug material is trimmed from both ends. The fistula tract length is determined by subtracting the length of trimmed excess plug material from the original plug length. The fistula plug is fixed and buried within the internal sphincter at the internal opening by a large figure-of-eight stitch with an absorbable suture. Care is taken to avoid occluding the external opening of the tract, thereby preserving a route for external drainage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22288925\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial reports of the fistula plug were favorable, particularly in high-risk fistula patients in whom treatment with fistulotomy, snug setons, or mucosal advancement flaps were ineffective or caused unacceptably high incontinence rates.

At 11 months, patients treated with a fistula plug had a higher rate of recurrence (71 versus 52 percent) and lower rates of postoperative soilage (29 versus 48 percent). However, these differences were not statistically significant, indicating that the number of patients in the trial was too small to detect significant differences of this magnitude. Another trial of 94 patients with transsphincteric fistula reported a higher recurrence rate at 12 months after a fistula plug than after an advancement flap (66 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Patients in both groups experienced similar improvements in anal pain and quality of life; fecal incontinence did not change (incontinence) after treatment.

The external opening and the remnant fistulous tract are curetted to the level of the proximity of the external sphincter complex. Finally, the intersphincteric incision is loosely reapproximated with an absorbable suture.

Meta-analyses report that the standard LIFT procedure achieved fistula healing in 61 to 94 percent of patients in four to eight weeks, with little morbidity and rare incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

Mucosal advancement flap and LIFT achieved similar primary healing rates of 91.4 and 94.3 percent after similar mean time to healing of 32 days (flap) and 23 days (LIFT).

Fecal diversion alone is effective in these select patients, but long-term success following reanastomosis is low because of recurrence from the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for cryptoglandular fistulas unrelated to Crohn disease, other infectious processes, or malignancy, yet no one procedure is universally efficacious and safe. (See <a href=\"#H22288661\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 6 to 12 weeks after treatment of an initial anorectal abscess or other septic process, patients with persistent drainage should undergo an examination under anesthesia to confirm the diagnosis of a fistula; surgical treatment may be initiated in the same setting. (See <a href=\"#H457691535\" class=\"local\">'Staged approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with no existing incontinence or risk factors for future incontinence, we suggest a primary fistulotomy, rather than a sphincter-sparing procedure, for a well-drained, low-lying (&lt;30 percent of sphincter complex) transsphincteric and intersphincteric simple fistula (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In these patients, fistulotomy results in healing in over 90 percent of patients with minimal or no de novo fecal incontinence. In patients with preexisting incontinence, however, fistulotomy is contraindicated in all situations. (See <a href=\"#H22288799\" class=\"local\">'Fistulotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with existing incontinence or concerns for future incontinence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients with a complex fistula, a draining seton is placed before a second sphincter-sparing procedure is performed after another six or more weeks. The choice of the secondary procedure is dictated by fistula anatomy and surgeon preference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116736\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116736 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a high transsphincteric fistula (&ge;30 percent of sphincter complex), we perform either an advancement flap or the ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure. We prefer LIFT for fistulas with an internal opening distal to the dentate line and for patients with preexisting incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H22288859\" class=\"local\">'Advancement flaps'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22288931\" class=\"local\">'Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a suprasphincteric fistula, we perform an advancement flap. Such fistulas have no intersphincteric tract and therefore cannot be treated with LIFT. (See <a href=\"#H22288859\" class=\"local\">'Advancement flaps'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extrasphincteric fistulas are typically not of cryptoglandular origin but instead caused by cancer or Crohn disease. These fistulas are rare but difficult to treat. Surgical options include proctectomy or fecal diversion. (See <a href=\"#H22288949\" class=\"local\">'Diversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We perform either the modified Hanley procedure, which involves a posterior midline incision and unroofing of all fistulous tracts, or an advancement flap for patients with horseshoe fistulas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22288895\" class=\"local\">'Modified Hanley procedure'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a recurrent fistula require a pelvic MRI to clarify anatomy and a seton for drainage. Further surgical treatment is dictated by fistula anatomy as outlined above. Options include modified Hanley procedure, snug seton, and advancement flap. (See <a href=\"#H4036441686\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent fistula'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin sealant and fistula plug are less effective but remain sphincter-sparing options for treating anal fistulas. (See <a href=\"#H519515085\" class=\"local\">'Fibrin sealant'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22288913\" class=\"local\">'Fistula plug'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Williams JG, Farrands PA, Williams AB, et al.
