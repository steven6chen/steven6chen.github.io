Although nausea and emesis (vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retching) can also result from surgery, opiates, or radiotherapy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is potentially the most severe and most distressing. Although significant progress has been made with the development of a number of effective and well-tolerated antiemetic treatments, CINV remains an important adverse effect of treatment.</p><p>The types of emesis, its pathophysiology, and factors predictive for the development of CINV will be reviewed here. The characteristics of the available antiemetic drugs, the management of CINV, and a general approach to the patient are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of antiemetic drugs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF EMESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three distinct types of CINV have been defined: acute, delayed, and anticipatory. Recognizing the differences between these types of CINV has important implications for both prevention and management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute emesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute emesis is defined as emesis occurring during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy. In the absence of effective prophylaxis, it most commonly begins within one to two hours of chemotherapy and usually peaks in the first four to six hours. Acute emesis is the most widely studied manifestation of CINV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed emesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emesis occurring more than 24 hours after chemotherapy is classified as delayed. It is best characterized following treatment with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. In the absence of antiemetic prophylaxis, delayed emesis after cisplatin peaks at approximately 48 to 72 hours after therapy, then gradually subsides over the next two to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While the frequency and number of episodes of emesis may be less during the delayed period compared with acute emesis, the delayed form is less well controlled with current antiemetic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Delayed emesis occurs most frequently after cisplatin but can also occur following other agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, anthracyclines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and after combinations, such as cyclophosphamide plus an anthracycline. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipatory emesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticipatory emesis is a conditioned response in patients who have developed significant nausea and vomiting during previous cycles of chemotherapy. It can be elicited by a variety of stimuli and cognitive activities in association with subsequent cycles of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As antiemetic control during the initial cycle of chemotherapy has progressively improved, anticipatory emesis has become a less significant clinical problem.

This understanding includes both the anatomy and neurotransmitters involved in CINV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroanatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several areas in the central and peripheral nervous systems and gastrointestinal tract are involved in CINV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70638 \">figure 1</a>). Three areas in the brainstem are thought to play critical roles in the emetic reflex: the central pattern generator (CPG; previously called the &quot;vomiting center&quot;) and two areas in the dorsal brainstem called the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and area postrema (AP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CPG is an anatomically indistinct collection of receptor and effector nuclei located in the medulla that coordinates the emetic reflex. It appears to coordinate the efferent respiratory, gastrointestinal, and autonomic activity associated with nausea and vomiting and functions as the final effector pathway through which a variety of afferent stimuli can activate emesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AP and NTS form a circumventricular structure located at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle. Together, these two areas were previously referred to as the &quot;chemoreceptor trigger zone.&quot; This part of the dorsal brain stem lies outside of the blood-brain barrier and is, therefore, accessible to emetic stimuli borne either in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">AP/NTS</span> appears to be an important source of afferent input to the CPG and is an important site for muscarinic (M1), dopamine (D2), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), neurokinin-1 (NK1), and histamine (H1) receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p>Two other sources of afferent input to the CPG with CINV include higher brainstem and cortical structures, which may play a role in anticipatory emesis, and input from the gastrointestinal tract that is conveyed by the vagus and splanchnic nerves, whose afferents terminate in the NTS in close proximity to or within the AP itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. These two areas of the brainstem are referred to collectively as the dorsal vagal complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70638 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurotransmitters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although over 30 neurotransmitters have been associated with the peripheral and central nervous system sites involved in CINV, three neurotransmitters have the most clinical relevance, since therapeutic agents designed to antagonize their action have shown clinical benefit as antiemetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5-HT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance P</p><p/><p>5-HT received significant attention during the 1980s in preclinical studies attempting to elucidate the mechanisms of CINV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These studies led to the development of the type-three 5-HT (5-HT3) receptor antagonists during the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and these drugs have become a mainstay of current antiemetic therapy for CINV.

Substance P binds to the NK1 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and selective antagonists of the NK1 receptor are potent antiemetics in preclinical models using a variety of emetic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subsequent clinical trials in CINV led to the development of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aprepitant</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosaprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosaprepitant</a> for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Several reviews summarize our current understanding of the pathophysiology of CINV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. The following figure schematically illustrates potential sites at which chemotherapy is thought to exert its emetic effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70638 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The mechanism that is best supported by research is that chemotherapeutic drugs can cause nausea and vomiting by activating neurotransmitter receptors in the small intestine; afferent fibers then transmit the stimuli to the brainstem, which then sends out efferent signals via the vagus nerve to induce vomiting. </p><p>Studies in animal models indicate that the intestinal cell damage produced by chemotherapy initiates the release of 5-HT and other neuroactive agents from enterochromaffin cells. These agents bind to the 5-HT3 receptor and other receptors on the vagal and splanchnic afferent fibers within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The stimulated vagal and splanchnic afferents project to the <span class=\"nowrap\">AP/NTS,</span> resulting in activation of the emetic reflex arc. </p><p>Current knowledge suggests that the emetic response to chemotherapy can occur through a central and a peripheral pathway, mediated by different neurotransmitters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70638 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peripheral pathway, which is predominantly mediated by 5-HT and 5-HT3 receptors in the intestinal tract, is associated primarily with acute emesis (that occurring within 24 hours of chemotherapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A central pathway, which is predominantly mediated by Substance P and NK1 receptors and is located primarily in the brain, is activated later and mainly associated with delayed CINV (after 24 hours). </p><p/><p>Some chemotherapy agents or their metabolites may interact directly or indirectly with receptors within the <span class=\"nowrap\">AP/NTS,</span> with subsequent activation of the CPG. Furthermore, higher central nervous system centers located in structures in the limbic forebrain, such as the amygdala, may also be a source of some types of emetic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTIVE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors have been identified that provide the clinician with a means of predicting the likelihood that CINV will develop in various situations.

A 1997 classification scheme gained broad acceptance and was utilized as the basis for treatment recommendations by guideline panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Chemotherapy agents were divided into five emetogenic levels that were defined by the expected frequency of emesis in the absence of effective antiemetic prophylaxis.</p><p>A modification of this schema was proposed at the 2004 Perugia Antiemetic Consensus Guideline meeting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and is still in widespread use, although many more chemotherapy agents are now available.

Unfortunately the risk-adapted model was not able to identify a true &quot;low-risk&quot; group that would not ultimately require the use of an NK1 receptor antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-prediction-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether models such as these provide additional information beyond the estimated emetogenicity potential of the individual chemotherapy agents is unclear.
