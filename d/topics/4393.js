Several studies have reported on the incidence of pediatric airway-related complications. Consistently reported risk factors for serious airway complications include very young age and multiple intubation attempts. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry found that respiratory events lead to 27 percent of all pediatric perioperative cardiac arrests. Laryngospasm was the most common cause of respiratory-related arrests; other etiologies included airway obstruction, difficult intubation, esophageal intubation, and aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-pediatric-airway-management-for-anesthesia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational multicenter cohort study of severe critical events in anesthesia (the Anaesthesia&nbsp;PRactice&nbsp;In&nbsp;Children&nbsp;Observational&nbsp;Trial [APRICOT] study) included 31,127 anesthetics in pediatric patients across 33 European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-pediatric-airway-management-for-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Respiratory and airway events accounted for 60 percent of all anesthesia-related complications and occurred in 3.1 percent of all anesthetics; laryngospasm occurred in 1.2 percent, bronchospasm in 1.2 percent, postoperative stridor in 0.7 percent, and aspiration in 0.1 percent of all anesthetics. The highest rates of airway and respiratory events occurred in neonates (&lt;1 month old) and infants (&lt;1 year old). Other risk factors for respiratory complications included history of prematurity and reactive airway disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter registry study of difficult intubations in 13 children's hospitals in the United States (the Pediatric Difficult Intubation [PeDI] study) found that among 1018 cases of difficult intubations, 20 percent had at least one complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-pediatric-airway-management-for-anesthesia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most common severe complication was cardiac arrest (2 percent of patients), and the most common nonsevere temporary complication was hypoxemia (oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] &lt;85 percent).

Hypoxemia may occur because of inability to ventilate by mask, but can also occur in the few seconds after the facemask is removed and before ventilation is reinstituted via a successfully placed airway device. </p><p>Infants have high vagal tone compared with adults, and are likely to experience severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest in response to hypoxemia, particularly when combined with stimulation of the airway. Among 1018 children who were difficult to intubate, hypoxemia (&gt;10 percent decrease from preintubation oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] for more than 45 seconds) occurred in 9 percent of patients, and cardiac arrest occurred in 16 percent of these patients who became hypoxemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-pediatric-airway-management-for-anesthesia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Laryngospasm must be recognized and treated rapidly to prevent complications. In most cases, laryngospasm responds to treatment without sequelae, but oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, negative pressure pulmonary edema, aspiration, and cardiac arrest can occur.</p><p>Laryngospasm is the reflex closure of the false and true vocal cords, accompanied by the descent of the epiglottis over the laryngeal orifice.

(See <a href=\"#H3942087055\" class=\"local\">'Bronchospasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspiration of gastric contents is a rare complication that can occur during any stage of anesthesia. If aspiration is suspected, initial management should include the following (see <a href=\"#H3555950488\" class=\"local\">'Management of aspiration'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suction the oropharynx</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administer 100 percent oxygen by facemask</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluate for and treat bronchospasm and laryngospasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For large particle aspiration, summon assistance for possible bronchoscopy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent management and disposition depend on the severity of signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1910651861\" class=\"local\">'Outcome and disposition after aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Croup can occur after endotracheal intubation due to local edema and inflammation caused by pressure of the endotracheal tube (ETT) on laryngeal or subglottic structures. (See <a href=\"#H2715691347\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of postintubation croup'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most important preventive measure is the use of an appropriately-sized ETT. Treatment for postintubation croup includes administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenous (IV) to a maximum of 10 mg, if not administered intraoperatively, and if necessary, administration of nebulized epinephrine. (See <a href=\"#H2681619632\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of postintubation croup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who receive nebulized epinephrine should be observed in the hospital for at least three to four hours after administration. Children who require repeat doses of epinephrine should be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring and treatment.
