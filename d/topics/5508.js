Discoid lupus can happen anywhere on the skin but usually happens on the upper body. The most common places for discoid lupus are the face, neck, scalp, and ears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98023736\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of discoid lupus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is red, scaly plaques. These plaques tend to slowly expand at the edges and then heal. When they heal, they leave behind discolored skin and sunken scars. Discoid lupus on the scalp can cause hair loss.</p><p>Sometimes, people with discoid lupus also have lupus in other parts of the body. This is called &quot;systemic lupus.&quot; But most people with discoid lupus just have lupus in their skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98023751\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are being treated for discoid lupus, see your doctor or nurse if the condition does not improve with the medicine you were given or if it gets worse. Seeing your doctor or nurse right away is important because treating your discoid lupus early can help to prevent more skin discoloration and scars. You should also see your doctor or nurse if you notice new bumps or sores in places where you have discoid lupus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98023766\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for discoid lupus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have discoid lupus, he or she can take a small sample of skin from 1 of your plaques and send it to the lab. There, another doctor will look at the types of cells that are present to learn whether you have discoid lupus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98023781\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's very important to protect your skin from the sun. Sun exposure tends to make the skin problems caused by discoid lupus worse. To protect yourself from the sun:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay out of the sun in the middle of the day (from 10 AM to 4 PM), when the sun's light is strongest</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay under a sun umbrella, tree, or other shady spot</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sunscreen &ndash; Put sunscreen on all parts of the body that are not covered by clothes. Then reapply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours, or after you sweat or swim. It's important to choose a sunscreen that:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has an SPF of 30 or greater &ndash; SPF is a number that tells you how well a sunscreen protects the skin from UV light.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Protects against 2 types of UV light, called &quot;UVA&quot; and &quot;UVB.&quot; (Sunscreens that offer both UVA and UVB protection are sometimes called &quot;broad spectrum.&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Has not expired or is not more than 3 years old</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use tanning beds</p><p/><p>If you smoke, it's a good idea to quit. Discoid lupus seems to be more severe in people who smoke. Plus, smoking seems to make certain medicines for discoid lupus less effective.</p><p>If you are bothered by the way discoid lupus looks on your skin, you can use special cosmetic products to make the skin changes less obvious. Both men and women can use these products. Examples are sold under the brand names Dermablend and Covermark. Other products can also be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98023796\"><span class=\"h1\">How is discoid lupus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines that come in ointments, creams, or gels &ndash; These steroid medicines reduce inflammation and help the skin heal. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluocinonide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clobetasol</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called calcineurin inhibitors that come in ointments or creams. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pimecrolimus</a> (brand name: Elidel) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tacrolimus</a> (brand name: Protopic).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines that come in a shot, which is given directly into the portion of skin that is affected.</p><p/><p>People who do not get better with the treatments mentioned above can get medicines that have been used to treat malaria. These medicines help with discoid lupus. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (brand name: Plaquenil) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">chloroquine</a> (brand name: Aralen).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98023811\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-and-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus and kidney disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
