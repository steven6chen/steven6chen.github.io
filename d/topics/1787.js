The Bartholin gland's main function is to secrete mucus to provide vaginal and vulvar lubrication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Each Bartholin gland is approximately 0.5 cm in size and drains tiny drops of mucous into a duct 2.5 cm long. The glands are deep to the posterior aspects of the labia majora. The ducts open onto the vulvar vestibule at the four and eight o'clock positions on each side of the vaginal orifice, just below the hymenal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66162\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66162 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The Bartholin gland is composed of several epithelial types: The body is mucinous acini, the duct is predominantly transitional epithelium, and the orifice is squamous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363590594\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BARTHOLIN GLAND MASSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363594199\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common types of Bartholin gland masses are cysts or abscesses.

Subsequent studies have found that fewer abscesses are polymicrobial and there is an increase in methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) as a pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A study from Israel reports that the most common pathogen is <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) used to be identified in as many as one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>], but this proportion has been declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The microbiology is illustrated in the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 219 women admitted as a result of a Bartholin abscess, purulent cultures were positive in 126 patients (61.8 percent). The single most common pathogen was <em>E. coli</em> (55 isolates) followed by polymicrobial infections (10 patients), <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (8 isolates), Group B <em>Streptococcus</em> (6 isolates), and <em>Enterococcus</em> species (spp) (6 isolates).

The predominant aerobic bacteria were <em>E. coli</em> (78 isolates), <em>Staphylococcus</em> spp (40 isolates) and <em>Streptococcus</em> spp (32 isolates); the most common anaerobic bacteria were <em>Bacteroides</em> spp (30 isolates). There were four positive isolates for <em>Neisseria gonorrhea </em>(<em>N. gonorrhea</em>) and one positive isolate for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>(<em>C. trachomatis</em>) (5 patients with STIs among 219 patients with positive cultures, about 2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An older study of 62 women with Bartholin abscesses undergoing marsupialization reported four <em>N. gonorrhea</em> and one <em>C. trachomatis</em> isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

There is typically no impact on hemodynamic status. Systemic infection may be occur in rare cases.</p><p>A vulvar examination is performed, including visual inspection followed by palpation of the Bartholin gland. The Bartholin gland is typically palpated on examination by holding the labium majus between a finger in the posterior vaginal introitus and a thumb lateral to the labium.

A large abscess, however, can expand into the upper labia. If the abscess is very close to the surface, pus may break through the thin layer of skin at a point (pointing) and may drain spontaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363593912\"><span class=\"h2\">Abscess cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If purulent material is obtained from a spontaneously draining wound or at the time of incision and drainage, we obtain cultures for aerobic bacteria, with specialized tests (nucleic acid amplification) for gonorrhea and chlamydia in patients at risk of sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>Historically, Bartholin abscess fluid was not always sent for culture because drainage is usually curative and infection is polymicrobial. However, this practice has changed because community-associated methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infections now account for many skin abscesses, including vulvar abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-18</a>].

For women who have recurrence of a cyst or abscess after one or two Word catheter placements, we suggest marsupialization as the second-line therapy rather than repeat Word catheter placement or gland excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105731\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105731 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H438949440\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excision of the Bartholin gland is the definitive therapy of cysts and abscesses, but it is associated with a high risk of hemorrhage and postoperative morbidity. Excision is typically performed if there is a recurrence after marsupialization or if there is a suspicion of Bartholin's gland carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H438948610\" class=\"local\">'Gland excision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest antibiotic therapy (in combination with I&amp;D) rather than an I&amp;D procedure alone for women with a recurrent Bartholin abscess, risk factors for a complicated infection (eg, pregnancy, immunocompromise, increased risk of MRSA, extensive surrounding cellulitis), or signs of systemic infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Known or suspected gonorrhea or chlamydia infection requires treatment. (See <a href=\"#H438948658\" class=\"local\">'Role of antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presentation of Bartholin gland cancer is as a painless vulvar mass. The mass may be solid, cystic, or abscessed, or a solid area may be palpated within a Bartholin cyst. Features that raise suspicion of malignancy and indicate a biopsy include palpable or visible solid mass within the cyst or abscess, fixation of the cyst or abscess wall to surrounding tissue, and a cyst or abscess that does not respond or worsens despite treatment. (See <a href=\"#H363593939\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H363592216\" class=\"local\">'Bartholin gland carcinoma'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bartholin-gland-masses-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Marzano DA, Haefner HK.
