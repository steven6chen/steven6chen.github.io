The term overt hyperthyroidism refers to patients with elevated levels of free T4, T3, or both and a subnormal TSH concentration.

The results of these studies, primarily in subjects over age 55 to 60 years, can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the community varies between 0.7 and 12.4 percent. This variability is in part due to differences in the definition of low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values and in the patient populations studied. In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from the United States, which excluded individuals with known thyroid disease, 0.7 percent of 16,533 people had subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical hyperthyroidism is more common in areas of the world with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. In addition, subclinical thyroid dysfunction is more common in females, smokers, and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism are the same as the causes of overt hyperthyroidism, and like overt hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism can be persistent or transient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76972 \">table 1</a>). Common causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism include excessive thyroid hormone therapy (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism), autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas and multinodular goiters (endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism), or Graves' disease (endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As many as 10 million people in the United States, and possibly as many as 200 million people worldwide, are taking thyroid hormone. All are at risk for subclinical hyperthyroidism, whether intentional or unintentional. Among patients taking T4, as many as 25 percent have low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], and in one study, 5.8 percent were under 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exogenous-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exogenous hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of these patients have hypothyroidism, and in them, subclinical hyperthyroidism is not the goal of thyroid hormone therapy. However, subclinical hyperthyroidism is the goal of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with thyroid cancer and in some patients with solitary thyroid nodules, multinodular or diffuse goiters, or a history of head and neck irradiation. In these patients, the benefits of TSH suppression are thought to outweigh the risks of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Among patients over age 55 years, hyperthyroidism due to multinodular goiters was subclinical in 57 percent of patients, while hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease was subclinical in only 6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In another study, 22 percent of patients with multinodular goiter had subclinical hyperthyroidism, while 28 percent of those with subclinical hyperthyroidism had autonomous area(s) on thyroid imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Subclinical hyperthyroidism also occurs in patients with thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and it has been reported in 63 percent of clinically euthyroid patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (euthyroid Graves' disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and 4 percent of those with Graves' disease in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It may also be seen in patients with early Graves' disease prior to the onset of more overt hyperthyroidism. In addition, healthy pregnant women (especially in the first trimester) and those with hyperemesis gravidarum (or trophoblastic disease) who have high serum chorionic gonadotropin concentrations may have subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Many patients have a multinodular goiter with autonomy (toxic nodular goiter) or mild Graves' disease. Most patients are detected through routine screening of thyroid function.</p><p>Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and, primarily in postmenopausal women, a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79602\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79602 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H2302868238\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism is based upon biochemical testing alone. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined biochemically as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in the presence of a subnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). (See <a href=\"#H2196647488\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism are treatment with T4 (exogenous) and autonomously functioning thyroid adenomas and multinodular goiters (endogenous) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76972 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and, primarily in postmenopausal women, a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). In addition, patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may progress to overt hyperthyroidism. Data regarding overall mortality and dementia are variable. (See <a href=\"#H1734731501\" class=\"local\">'Potential consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism and who have TSH concentrations below normal should have their dose adjusted to maintain a normal serum TSH concentration (approximately 0.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Patients on T4 for the treatment of hypothyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with thyroid cancer and in some patients with benign nodular thyroid disease, subclinical hyperthyroidism is the goal of thyroid hormone therapy. The adverse effects of suppressive therapy can be minimized by treatment with the lowest dose of T4 necessary to meet the desired goal. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Patients on suppressive T4 therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism at high risk for cardiac or skeletal complications (eg, older adults &ge;65 years, patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease, or postmenopausal women with or at risk for osteoporosis) and who have a TSH concentration less than 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> we recommend treatment of the underlying cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109938\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109938 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Patients at high risk for complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For similar patients who have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> we suggest treatment especially if the bone density is low, if there is underlying cardiovascular disease, if the patient has hyperthyroid symptoms, or if the radionuclide scan shows one or more focal areas of increased uptake (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Observation is an alternative in asymptomatic patients, especially in the absence of an autonomous nodule on thyroid scan, in patients with normal bone density, in patients who are taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce bone turnover, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for other reasons. In observed patients, we measure TSH, free T4, and T3 every six months and obtain a bone density every two years. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Patients at high risk for complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism at low risk for cardiac or skeletal complications (young individuals, premenopausal women) and TSH values less than 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> we suggest treatment, especially if the patient has hyperthyroid symptoms or if the radionuclide scan shows one or more focal areas of increased uptake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F109938\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109938 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
