It subsequently was identified as the leading cause of foodborne illness in Japan, and is a frequent global cause of diarrhea in areas where seafood consumption is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> infections will be reviewed here. <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em>, other &quot;non-cholera&quot; Vibrios, and <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> are discussed separately.

This is known as the Kanagawa phenomenon, named after the region in Japan where it was discovered.</p><p>The Kanagawa phenomenon was originally demonstrated in 96 percent of Japanese clinical isolates but in only 1 percent of environmental strains. In one study of human volunteers, Kanagawa-positive strains produced diarrhea, while Kanagawa-negative strains did not (even in doses of up to 10(9) organisms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Deletion of the Vp-TDH gene results in loss of enterotoxic activity in laboratory models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A second group of hemolysins, known as Vp-TDH-related hemolysins, or Vp-TRH, can be found in certain clinical isolates of <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em>. Many of these strains are phenotypically Kanagawa negative. Along the Pacific coast of the United States and in parts of Asia, there have been case clusters associated with <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> strains that are urease positive but Kanagawa negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These strains have almost always been shown to carry the genes for Vp-TRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Although the majority of clinical isolates produce Vp-TDH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Vp-TRH, in one study 6 percent of clinical samples lacked both toxin genes, suggesting the presence of additional virulence factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Genomic studies have shown that some <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> strains carry genes for the type III secretion system, which has been linked with pathogenicity in other diarrheal pathogens (eg, <em>Shigella</em> spp, <em>Salmonella</em> spp, enteropathogenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and other non-cholera Vibrios) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. This may be an additional virulence factor associated with a more invasive type of diarrhea due to <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like other Vibrios, <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> exists as a free-living bacterium in estuarine or marine environments and is a common seafood contaminant. Counts of the bacterium in the environment (and in oysters) tend to increase as water temperatures rise, making this a microorganism that is particularly susceptible to the effect of global warming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Bacterial counts may also be influenced by salinity; higher counts are observed in regions of lower salinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>There was a global increase in the incidence of <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> infections beginning in the mid-1990s, associated with the appearance of a new pandemic clonal group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Isolates in this group have a high degree of genetic similarity, albeit with a diversity of serotypes, including O3:K6, O4:K68, and O1:K untypable (O1:KUT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. These isolates were first identified on the Indian subcontinent and subsequently have been identified in clinical and environmental samples from all continents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. They appeared in the late <span class=\"nowrap\">1990s/early</span> 2000s along the western coast of South America, in an expansion reminiscent of the appearance of <em>V. cholerae</em> El Tor in South America in 1991. In both instances, spread of the pandemic microorganism from Asia to South America occurred in the setting of an El Nino weather event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A subsequent epidemic involving a sequence type (ST)-120 strain was reported in 2009, with genetic data again implicating Asia as the source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Reports from surveillance programs suggest that the incidence of <em>Vibrio</em> infections in the United States is increasing, from 0.01 to 0.06 per 100,000 persons in 1996 to an estimated 0.39 cases per 100,000 in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In 2014, 605 cases of <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> infection were reported in the United States to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance (COVIS) surveillance system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75467 \">table 1</a>); these constituted almost half of the 1252 <em>Vibrio</em> infections reported in the United States for the year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. From 2012 to 2013, the number of foodborne cases of <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> traced to shellfish harvested on the Atlantic Coast exceeded the typical annual average by threefold, and most cases were associated with outbreaks due to a strain that had previously only been associated with shellfish from the Pacific Coast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p><em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> is most commonly transmitted by contaminated seafood. In the United States, <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> has been responsible for a number of major food-borne disease outbreaks, often involving mishandling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cross-contamination of seafood after cooking. Commonly implicated vehicles include oysters, clams, and have traditionally included shrimp, crab, and, in one study in coastal areas of Texas and Louisiana, cooked crayfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/21,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,38-40</a>].</p><p>Wound infections are most often associated with marine recreational activities (swimming, shore walking, boating) and, less commonly, with handling of seafood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> most commonly causes gastroenteritis, characterized predominantly by diarrhea; a smaller percentage have wound infections. Bacteremia can also occur, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as liver disease. Fifteen percent of reported case patients in the United States in 2014 were hospitalized, and 1 percent died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H229202121\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroenteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a case series of 345 sporadic <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> infections in the United States, clinical manifestations of patients with gastroenteritis included diarrhea (98 percent), abdominal cramps (89 percent), nausea (76 percent), vomiting (55 percent), and fever (52 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Bloody diarrhea has been reported in up to 29 percent of cases in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Based on data from food-borne outbreaks, the median incubation period for gastroenteritis is 17 hours (range, 4 to 90 hours), with a median reported duration of illness of 2.4 days (range, 8 hours to 12 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Somewhat milder symptomatology was reported in an oyster-associated outbreak in Alaska: fever (34 percent), vomiting (29 percent) and bloody diarrhea (7 percent); the median duration of symptoms was 5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2199576098\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound infections associated with exposure of wounds to estuarine waters are generally mild. However, for patients with underlying conditions such as liver disease, alcoholism, or diabetes, cellulitis can be severe, with a reported 3 percent case fatality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2446489209\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> can also cause septicemia, particularly in individuals with underlying liver disease (as with other Vibrios). In a report of 17 patients with <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> septicemia, the case fatality rate was 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among the 11 patients with sepsis for whom food histories were available, 10 (91 percent) had eaten raw oysters before the onset of illness.

Isolation from stool generally requires use of a selective medium, such as Thiosulfate Citrate Bile-salts Sucrose (TCBS). <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> does not ferment sucrose; consequently, colonies on TCBS are blue-green in color (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73856 \">picture 1</a>). Species identification is based on standard biochemical tests; the accuracy may be improved with the addition of a few drops of 10 percent NaCl prior to inoculation. The laboratory should be alerted regarding cases in which <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> is suspected so that the appropriate diagnostic techniques can be implemented. </p><p>Most environmental <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> isolates lack the genes necessary to cause illness in humans. Clinically significant isolates are hemolytic (have a positive Kanagawa reaction) or have a positive urease reaction. Confirmation that a strain is pathogenic requires use of PCR to screen for the presence of TDH and TRH genes; in general, this is a research tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vibrio-parahaemolyticus-infections/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume repletion is the most important element of therapy in patients with <em>Vibrio </em>gastroenteritis. The gastroenteritis caused by <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em> tends to be mild and self-limited. Antimicrobial therapy is reasonable in more severe cases, since among patients with cholera, antibiotic therapy is known to decrease the duration of diarrhea and the excretion of infectious organisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no controlled trials of therapy for gastroenteritis due to <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em>. Therefore, antimicrobial therapy is guided by the same principles used for comparable clinical syndromes caused by other <em>Vibrio</em> species. Based on clinical trials in cholera and in vitro susceptibility data, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is a reasonable antibiotic choice; reasonable alternatives include fluoroquinolones and macrolides. The duration of therapy depends on the antibiotic chosen, as outlined separately for cholera.</p><p>Wound infections require debridement and antimicrobial therapy. Mild wound infections in patients who do not have significant underlying diseases generally respond well to local wound care and oral antibiotics (such as a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> or a fluoroquinolone). This approach is guided by the same principles used for comparable clinical syndromes caused by <em>V. vulnificus</em>. Duration of therapy is dictated by clinical response; most patients respond to five to seven days of antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vibrio-vulnificus-infections#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vibrio vulnificus infections&quot;, section on 'Therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with septicemia or wound infections in the setting of risk factors for septicemia require aggressive antimicrobial therapy, frequently in an ICU setting. The approach to choice of antibiotic therapy for such cases is as outlined for <em>V. vulnificus</em>: combination therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice daily), plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (2 g intravenously every eight hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (1 g intravenously daily). Depending on clinical response and the degree of the patient&rsquo;s immunosuppression, two weeks (or more) of antimicrobial therapy may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vibrio-vulnificus-infections#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vibrio vulnificus infections&quot;, section on 'Therapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all Vibrios, risk of infection may be reduced by avoiding consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly during warm, summer months.
