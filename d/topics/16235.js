In some cases, predominantly solid liver lesions may have cystic components, as may be seen with hemangiomas or tumors that have areas that are necrotic. Conversely, predominantly cystic liver lesions may have solid areas, particularly in the setting malignancy.</p><p>This topic will review the differential diagnosis of solid liver lesions, outline an approach to their evaluation, and discuss the radiographic findings associated with common solid liver lesions. The pathology of malignant liver tumors, the approach to patients with cystic liver lesions, and liver abscesses are discussed elsewhere.

It is important to establish a correct diagnosis, especially when the potential for therapy exists. The diagnosis requires consideration of the clinical history, risk factors, laboratory test findings, imaging studies, and in some cases, pathologic examination of the lesion. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>While most of these lesions present as solitary masses, multiple lesions may be seen in patients with hepatic hemangiomas, idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension, regenerative nodules, hepatocellular carcinoma, and metastatic disease. </p><p>Common benign liver lesions include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic hemangioma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal nodular hyperplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic adenoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (including nodular regenerative hyperplasia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regenerative nodules</p><p/><p>Inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare benign solid liver tumor comprised of proliferating fibrous tissue infiltrated by inflammatory cells.

Hemangiomas are typically discovered incidentally at laparotomy, autopsy, or during an imaging test performed for unrelated conditions. Although they can be diagnosed at any age, 60 to 80 percent of hepatic hemangiomas are diagnosed in patients who are between the ages of 30 and 50 years. In adults, hemangiomas occur more frequently in women, with a female to male ratio of 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension is frequently associated with a systemic autoimmune disease, and occurs more commonly among older adults.

Patients should be asked about alcohol use, risk factors for viral hepatitis, and family history of metabolic liver diseases such as hereditary hemochromatosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma may cause hepatic decompensation in a patient with previously compensated cirrhosis and should be considered in this setting.

It may involve the intrahepatic ducts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the extrahepatic ducts. A number of risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma have been recognized. In the United States and Europe, the main risk factors are primary sclerosing cholangitis and choledochal cysts.

The presence of an extrahepatic malignancy should be sought in patients with characteristic liver lesions on imaging studies.

However, some patients will have symptoms or findings related to the lesion (eg, pain, pruritus, or a palpable mass) or to predisposing conditions (eg, cirrhosis or an extrahepatic malignancy). </p><p>Abdominal pain can occur in patients with hepatic adenomas (particularly if there is rupture and bleeding of the adenoma) and less often in patients with hepatic hemangiomas or focal nodular hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. Abdominal pain can also occur among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma; however, patients with small tumors are often asymptomatic. Other symptoms in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma may include weight loss and early satiety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-adenoma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic adenoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-hemangioma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic hemangioma&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-nodular-hyperplasia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal nodular hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma typically have cirrhosis, so peripheral stigmata of cirrhosis may be present (eg, palmar erythema, spider angiomata). In addition, patients may have evidence of hepatic decompensation, such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or ascites. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma may also have a palpable mass, a finding that suggests an advanced lesion. Laboratory testing in patients with cirrhosis may reveal an elevated bilirubin, prolonged prothrombin time, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with metastatic tumors may have findings related to the underlying malignancy (eg, rectal bleeding in a patient colon cancer). In addition, patients with liver metastases may have abnormal liver tests, though the finding is nonspecific.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the diagnosis of a patient with a solid liver lesion starts with identification of risk factors for specific lesions, as well as determining if there are clinical findings that may be related to the lesion or to predisposing conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78245\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78245 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the history or examination suggests a potential diagnosis, the diagnostic evaluation should start with a focus on that particular lesion (eg, computed tomography scanning [CT] for hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic lesions). If the history and physical examination are negative, we typically start the evaluation with laboratory testing and a triphasic contrast-enhanced CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If imaging tests fail to make the diagnosis, the lesion may need to be biopsied or resected. (See <a href=\"#H155745288\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H155746381\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of malignant liver tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In many cases, the diagnosis can be made with a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. This was illustrated in a study involving 160 consecutive patients with focal liver lesions in whom initial evaluation could not exclude a malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. More detailed evaluation included a series of laboratory tests (including tumor markers) and a variety of imaging studies. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was not used. All patients subsequently underwent surgical excision. Preoperative diagnoses were correct in 156 of the patients (98 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155747176\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) are at increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. If the patient has evidence of cirrhosis (eg, on physical examination or imaging) but does not have a prior diagnosis of chronic liver disease, serologic testing should include a search for common causes of cirrhosis, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and hemochromatosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55647 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic approach to a solid liver lesion in patients with cirrhosis or chronic HBV is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155747326\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with extrahepatic malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastases to the liver are a likely cause of a solid liver lesion in patients with an extrahepatic malignancy. In such patients, the evaluation should start with a search for metastatic disease in other organs. This typically involves CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis as well as chest imaging. The presence of lesions in multiple organs supports a diagnosis of metastatic disease. The specific staging evaluation will depend on what malignancy the patient has. </p><p>Radiologically-guided liver biopsy or fine needle aspiration is often useful to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, histologic confirmation is not always essential if reasonable certainty can be achieved with imaging studies, or in settings in which there would be little benefit to the patient to establish a firm diagnosis. </p><p>However, patients with extrahepatic malignancies may also have incidental liver lesions, so if the evaluation for metastatic disease suggests the lesion is not metastatic in origin, additional evaluation is required. (See <a href=\"#H155747184\" class=\"local\">'Patients without cirrhosis, HBV, or extrahepatic malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155747184\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients without cirrhosis, HBV, or extrahepatic malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach in patients without known liver disease includes identification of risk factors for solid liver lesions, an serologic evaluation for previously undiagnosed liver disease, and hepatic imaging (usually a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan, though MRI or ultrasonography are alternatives) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78245\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78245 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The size of the liver lesion is an important consideration in guiding the evaluation. Lesions larger than 1 cm can be diagnosed in most cases either by radiographic findings or histology. Lesions smaller than 1 cm in patients who are not at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma are commonly benign, incidental findings on imaging studies, and in most cases represent small cysts, hemangiomas, or biliary hamartomas. Furthermore, they are frequently difficult to definitively characterize by imaging methods due to their small size and are difficult to biopsy percutaneously. Often clinical follow-up is the only recourse for these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In such patients, we typically will obtain a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to look for imaging features of HCC. If negative, we then obtain a follow-up ultrasound in three months. This approach differs from guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which recommend repeat ultrasound after three months. We then repeat ultrasounds yearly. If the lesion is stable after three radiographic examinations, we stop radiographic surveillance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155745005\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a solid liver lesion should have a serum alpha-fetoprotein level checked. If elevated, a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma becomes more likely, though imaging studies and possibly biopsy (if the imaging features are not characteristic for HCC) are still required to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should also be evaluated for hepatitis B virus with serologic testing for HBV surface antigen. If the patients is found to have cirrhosis during the evaluation (eg, if noted on radiographic imaging), the evaluation should include testing for common causes of cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155744942\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, diagnostic imaging of solid hepatic lesions starts with a triphasic abdominal CT scan with contrast. If the CT scan is non-diagnostic, an MRI with gadolinium-based contrast (eg, Gd-BOPTA- or Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) can be obtained for further evaluation. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after radiographic imaging and the results will affect patient management, obtaining tissue for histologic examination (via biopsy or surgical resection) may be required.</p><p>Technical advances in CT scanning permit large regions of the body to be imaged rapidly. As an example, the entire liver can be imaged in less than six seconds using the newer 64-row CT scanners. However, with increasing use of scanning, more incidentally-detected lesions are being discovered that cannot be fully characterized by CT. In such cases, additional radiologic imaging with MRI is usually suggested. Another problem with CT scanning is that it exposes patients to radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who cannot undergo a CT scan with contrast, MRI is an alternative. If neither contrast-enhanced CT nor MRI is an option, ultrasound can be used, though ultrasound findings alone are generally not sufficient to confirm a diagnosis. As an example, transabdominal ultrasonography is inferior in sensitivity for liver metastases compared with either CT or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. By contrast, intraoperative ultrasonography (during which the transducer is placed directly upon the liver surface) is the most sensitive imaging technique for diagnosing liver metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As with other hepatic masses, intraoperative ultrasonography can be helpful in delineating the extent of disease and vascular landmarks during hepatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Where available, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) can be used to evaluate liver lesions. Studies looking at contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the characterization of focal liver lesions have estimated that CEUS has a sensitivity of approximately 95 percent and a specificity of approximately 94 percent for diagnosing malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>].

The diagnosis can be confirmed with Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI or triphasic CT for evaluating suspected focal nodular hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-nodular-hyperplasia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal nodular hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Imaging tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257828780\"><span class=\"h3\">Fine needle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the diagnosis is uncertain after obtaining imaging studies, fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) can be considered if the results are likely to affect the patient's management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. However, a number of controversial issues surround the role of FNA in this setting. First, it is commonly nondiagnostic when used to evaluate some types of liver lesions such as hepatic adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia. Second, it is associated with some degree of risk, including bleeding and seeding of neoplastic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Because of increased bleeding risk, a biopsy or aspirate is generally not recommended in patients with suspected hepatic adenomas. Third, the cost-effectiveness of FNA compared with non-histologic means of diagnosis has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of eight studies of needle biopsy for suspected hepatocellular carcinoma estimated that the risk of needle tract seeding was 2.7 percent overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257828787\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection is typically recommended for lesions that are symptomatic or if hepatocellular carcinoma cannot be excluded based on laboratory tests, imaging, and (in some cases) FNA.

Approximately 5 percent of the injected dose is taken up by hepatocytes and excreted into the biliary system via an ATP-dependent organic anion transporter peptide. Thus, liver lesions that contain hepatocytes with an intact biliary excretion mechanism will take up this contrast agent and be easily distinguished from lesions that do not.

(See <a href=\"#H155747326\" class=\"local\">'Patients with extrahepatic malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the history and physical examination are negative, we typically start the evaluation with laboratory testing and a triphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging. If imaging tests fail to make the diagnosis, the lesion may need to be biopsied or resected. (See <a href=\"#H155747184\" class=\"local\">'Patients without cirrhosis, HBV, or extrahepatic malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bonder A, Afdhal N.
