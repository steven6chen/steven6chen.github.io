Most episodes occur within one month post-transplantation, although acute cellular rejection may present later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A retrospective analysis of 970 liver transplantations found an 11 percent incidence of late acute cellular rejection (&gt;90 days post-transplantation) that was associated with recent changes in and lower levels of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition to the type and level of immunosuppression, certain transplantation-related characteristics may influence the risk of rejection. As an example, patients who receive an organ from a living related donor may have a lower rate of acute cellular rejection compared with deceased donor liver transplantation recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Moreover, a study of living donor liver transplant recipients found that patients transplanted for autoimmune hepatitis were less likely to respond to an initial course of bolus glucocorticoid therapy and were more likely to have recurrent acute cellular rejection after achieving remission compared with recipients with other causes of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The consequences of acute cellular rejection are variable. While it can predispose to glucocorticoid-resistant rejection and graft loss, most episodes do not have long-term adverse effects except in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis C'</a> below). Furthermore, acute cellular rejection identified by protocol liver biopsy in the absence of biochemical dysfunction often resolves without increasing immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is even a suggestion that such subclinical immune activation might be beneficial in inducing a degree of tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The timing of rejection might affect outcomes. In a large retrospective study, early acute rejection was associated with better graft survival and late acute rejection was associated with reduced graft survival, when compared with graft survival rates in patients without an episode of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients who developed late acute cellular rejection had a 28 percent rate of chronic rejection and a 6 percent risk of graft failure.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of acute cellular rejection following liver transplantation. The approach to immunosuppression and the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection following liver transplantation are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-overview-of-immunosuppression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Overview of immunosuppression&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Diagnosis of acute cellular rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute cellular rejection is usually suspected by elevations in serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, which typically precede clinical symptoms of jaundice and fever. However, biochemical parameters are not sensitive or specific for detecting acute cellular rejection and do not correlate with its severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, the diagnosis should be confirmed by liver biopsy before initiating treatment for rejection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Diagnosis of acute cellular rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a rare cause of allograft injury and loss after ABO-compatible liver transplantation that can be confused with and overlap with acute cellular rejection. Proposed features of antibody-mediated rejection in patients following liver transplant include donor-specific HLA alloantibodies in serum, microvascular endothelial cell injury on biopsy, and linear C4d positivity in liver sinusoids, in the absence of other causes of liver injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment for histologic evidence of mild acute cellular rejection (ie, rejection activity index [RAI] &le;4) varies by center and depends on the patient&rsquo;s current immunosuppressive regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74243\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74243 \">table 1</a>).

In patients treated with tacrolimus who have sub-therapeutic levels, tacrolimus doses can be increased. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> can be added or the dose can be increased. In all cases, careful monitoring is required and early re-biopsy can be obtained in patients who do not show biochemical improvement, followed by initiation of high-dose glucocorticoids in those without histologic improvement.</p><p>For patients with moderate to severe acute cellular rejection (ie, RAI &gt;4), high-dose glucocorticoids are usually first-line therapy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylprednisolone</a> doses vary among centers, ranging from 500 mg to 1000 mg boluses given daily for one to three days. A gradual glucocorticoid taper is provided at some centers following bolus methylprednisolone. In a randomized trial, 1000 mg of methylprednisolone followed by a six day taper from 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> was more effective for the treatment of acute cellular rejection and associated with less infectious complications than giving 1000 mg of methylprednisolone on three consecutive days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Approximately 70 to 80 percent of episodes of acute cellular rejection resolve after a course of high-dose glucocorticoids, and a second course is effective in many of the remaining cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Biochemical and histologic improvement is generally observed within three to five days when glucocorticoid therapy is successful. Some centers perform a follow-up liver biopsy at the completion of bolus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> therapy to document histologic recovery.</p><p>The cumulative immunosuppressive effect of high-dose glucocorticoids increases susceptibility to infections, including oral candidiasis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously referred to as <em>P. carinii</em>), and bacterial pathogens. Other potential side effects include hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hypertension, and mood changes. When treating with high-dose glucocorticoids, we resume CMV prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> for three to six months and consider three to six months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for<em> P. jirovecii </em>prophylaxis. We use prophylactic proton pump inhibitors and follow blood glucose levels during high-dose glucocorticoid therapy.

Treatment with glucocorticoids or with T-cell depletion is associated with acceleration of HCV progression and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Furthermore, the biochemical and histologic features of acute cellular rejection and HCV infection are similar, making it difficult to distinguish these disorders. As a result, many centers defer treatment of mild acute cellular rejection when it is not clearly the primary cause of histologic injury, given the tolerance of hepatic allografts to mild rejection and the negative consequences of treating rejection in patients with HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrence of hepatitis C virus infection following liver transplantation&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Repeated biopsies can be useful in assessing whether changes of mild acute cellular rejection progress and become the dominant histologic feature, prompting initiation of bolus glucocorticoid therapy. An alternative approach to equivocal cases of acute cellular rejection in patients with HCV is to increase the calcineurin inhibitor dose or to start an additional agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Further studies are needed to identify methods to better distinguish acute cellular rejection from HCV recurrence and to determine the impact of the various management options on outcomes. Hepatic gene expression profiling represents one means to differentiate between acute cellular rejection and HCV recurrence, although such technology is not yet sufficiently developed for clinical application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Treatment of HCV with direct antiviral agents is effective and tolerable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and provides a means to distinguish and manage the component of liver injury related to HCV infection.
