Dofetilide has also been used in an off-label manner to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias. Some investigators have studied the efficacy of dofetilide in the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, although the drug is not approved for this indication. In contrast to some other antiarrhythmic medications, dofetilide appears to be hemodynamically safe for use in patients with heart failure or a prior myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Because of a relatively high risk of torsades de pointes as an adverse effect of dofetilide, it has a formal risk evaluation and mitigation program that requires training and certification of treatment sites. (See <a href=\"#H453858352\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>The basic pharmacologic properties of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, its clinical uses, and its safety profile are discussed in detail here. Alternative treatment approaches for supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are discussed separately.

Dofetilide has relative selectivity for blocking the rapidly-activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) at concentrations of 10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">nanomole/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. At these concentrations, it does not block the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) or the inward rectifier (IKi) and does not affect calcium currents. Evidence from one study shows that dofetilide and several other drugs known to cause torsades de pointes (d-sotalol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioridazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioridazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>) increase the late sodium current (I<sub>NaL</sub>) in cardiac cells, an action (IC<sub>50 </sub>= 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromole/L)</span> that could contribute to their arrhythmogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>As a result of its electrophysiologic actions on I<sub>Kr </sub>and possibly I<sub>NaL</sub>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a> has a selective effect on the QT interval of the surface ECG.

Purkinje fibers from female dogs are more sensitive to dofetilide than fibers from male dogs, which is consistent with the threefold greater incidence of torsades de pointes in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Several other countries worldwide have also approved its use; however, widespread approval and usage have been somewhat limited due to safety concerns. Because of the risk of torsades de pointes, patients must be <strong>hospitalized</strong> for a minimum of three days for dofetilide initiation at a facility that can provide dosing based on estimated creatinine clearance, cardiac monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation. The majority of episodes of torsades de pointes have occurred within the three-day period of initial dosing and at the time of peak increase in the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Because dofetilide can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it is recommended that it should be reserved for patients in whom atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/atrial</span> flutter is highly symptomatic. Although not approved for use, it has been evaluated in small studies in patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia.

Torsades de pointes has been reported in up to 3 percent of patients receiving dofetilide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/15,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33</a>]. In a pooled analysis from the dofetilide treated patients in the DIAMOND-HF and DIAMOND-MI trials (where the incidence of torsades de pointes was 2.1 percent), the risk of torsades de pointes was greater in women than in men (OR 2.2), and in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure (OR 3.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Despite the increased risk of torsade de pointes, a pooled analysis of 1346 patients receiving dofetilide and 677 treated with placebo in randomized clinical trials did not show an increase in mortality with dofetilide use (adjusted hazard ratio 1.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>To evaluate the incidence and risk factors for in-hospital adverse events as well as the long-term safety of continued use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, one study conducted a retrospective chart review of a cohort of 1404 patients initially receiving loading doses for AF suppression between 2008 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of the 17 patients (1.2 percent) who developed torsades de pointes during loading, 10 had a cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation (with one death), five had <span class=\"nowrap\">syncope/presyncope,</span> and two were asymptomatic. Dofetilide loading doses were stopped for 105 patients (7.5 percent) due to excessive QTc prolongation or torsades de pointes. Variables that correlated with torsades de pointes were female gender, 500 mcg dose, reduced ejection fraction, and increase in QTc from baseline. One-year all-cause mortality was higher in patients who continued dofetilide compared with those who discontinued use (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.71, p = 0.03). Those patients who experienced a torsades de pointes event had higher one-year all-cause mortality than those who did not (17.6 versus 3 percent at one year, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Because excessive QT prolongation is assumed to be a critical component of torsades de pointes, orally administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a> has been used to shorten dofetilide-induced QT prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Magnesium has been found to reduce QT prolongation and enhance efficacy with a much lower incidence of torsades de pointes than expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapeutic-use-of-dofetilide/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

As a result, while caution is appropriate to avoid additive or synergistic effects resulting in QT prolongation and increased risk of torsades de pointes, the presence of inhibitory effects of certain drug-drug combinations indicates the need for additional research to gain a better understanding of drug-drug interaction on the QT interval and action potential duration.</p><p>The lack of an increase in mortality with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a> in the DIAMOND trials is reassuring.
