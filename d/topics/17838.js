Locoregional recurrences are seen in 15 to 50 percent of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and this is a major factor contributing to deaths from head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Recurrent head and neck cancer is difficult to treat for multiple reasons, including the effects of prior treatment on tumor cells, as well as the infiltrative and multifocal nature that typically characterizes recurrent disease in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The approach to treatment for patients with locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck will be reviewed here.

This is especially true for those patients who have recurrent disease or second primary cancer in a previously irradiated field, due to the substantial risks associated with reirradiation. Thus, an important part of the evaluation of previously irradiated patients with recurrent head and neck cancer is distinguishing those who are candidates for aggressive, potentially curative therapies from those for whom palliative measures and supportive care are more appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reirradiation for locally recurrent head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-metastatic-and-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of metastatic and recurrent head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have had prior radiation comprise a heterogenous group and are substantially different from those who recur or develop second primary cancers after surgery alone. These previously irradiated patients should be evaluated for treatment based on the site and stage of disease. Isolated small-volume disease can be considered for surgery alone, while patients with bulkier <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more extensive recurrences are appropriate candidates for concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as definitive treatment or in the postoperative setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613878340\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with local or regionally recurrent disease should be evaluated for distant metastases. Systemic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palliative radiation therapy can be considered for those with distant metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-metastatic-and-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of metastatic and recurrent head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Those whose disease is confined to the head and neck may benefit from definitive therapy (surgical salvage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reirradiation with chemotherapy). A number of factors may influence the likelihood of benefit from aggressive salvage therapy and should be considered in planning treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stage of disease at recurrence may identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from aggressive treatment. A combined analysis that included 32 reports with over 1000 patients and a prospective series of 109 cases who underwent salvage surgery stratified outcomes and complication risks by stage of disease at recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stage I and II recurrent cancer, the two-year recurrence-free survival with salvage surgery was 70 percent, 60 to 85 percent achieved or exceeded presurgical quality of life (QOL), and the surgical complication rate was 6 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stage III recurrent cancer, the two-year recurrence-free survival dropped to 30 percent. Significant complications occurred in 30 percent, while only 40 percent of patients achieved or exceeded their baseline QOL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stage IV recurrent cancer, outcomes were poor. Less than one-fourth of patients lived recurrence free for two years; one-half of patients had a recurrence before five months and died within nine months. Complication rates and QOL were similar to those for stage III patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial disease-free interval has an important role in determining the treatment approach. Patients with a disease recurrence within one year of initial treatment have a significantly worse prognosis compared with those who recur later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The site of recurrence has a considerable impact on outcome.

However, the morbidity associated with salvage surgery can be substantial.</p><p>A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of oropharyngeal cancer patients from 22 retrospective studies (with a total of 1105 patients) reported superior five-year overall survival (26 versus 16 percent, p &lt;0.001) after surgical salvage compared with reirradiation; patient selection likely accounts for this difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For patients who are candidates for aggressive therapy but have tumors not amenable to surgical salvage, irradiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy is recommended and may offer long-term survival or palliation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

For example, surgical treatment of oropharyngeal tumors recurrent after definitive chemoradiotherapy may be the only viable treatment option for many patients. Surgical options include open techniques and more conservative approaches.</p><p>Much of the data on quality of life (QOL) and complications come from patients treated initially with primary surgery or radiation therapy alone. As more patients are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy for functional organ preservation, the role of surgical salvage is evolving. However, prior treatment with chemoradiotherapy may complicate the management of patients who require salvage surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Open surgical salvage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported five-year overall survival rates after salvage surgery generally range from 11 to 39 percent, although higher rates have been reported for highly selected patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/5,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613879544\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complication rates in patients undergoing open salvage surgery are higher than in previously untreated patients, secondary to the effects of prior radiation therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. Furthermore, the increased use of chemoradiotherapy as a combined modality approach may further impair healing and lead to increased complication rates compared with patients managed with surgery or radiation therapy alone. Despite this, salvage surgery may result in an improvement in QOL for patients with recurrent disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Health-related quality of life in head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A meta-analysis that included data from 1633 patients reported rates of operative mortality, total complications, and major complications of 5 (range 0 to 18), 39 (range 10 to 88), and 27 (range 5 to 48) percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

An observational study of 107 patients measured QOL before and after surgery using both the Functional Living Index for Cancer (FLIC), which is a general measure of QOL, and the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN), which includes subscales that measure normalcy of diet, understandability of speech, and eating in public [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locally-recurrent-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After surgery, 51 percent of patients showed improvement in FLIC score, with a 16 percent average increase in FLIC score over baseline achieved over a mean of 4.8 months. The percentage of patients who reached or exceeded their presurgery baseline PSS-HN score for normalcy of diet, understandability of speech, and public eating behavior was 47, 41, and 50 percent, with average improvement of 2 to 30 percent over baseline.
