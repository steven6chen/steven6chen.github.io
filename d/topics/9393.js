After the fourth week, the LABA was discontinued and during weeks six to nine, the inhaled glucocorticoids were stopped. Dupilumab was associated with a significant decrease in the odds of an asthma exacerbation (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.28), which was the primary outcome. Injection-site reactions, headache, nasopharyngitis, and nausea occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo. Further studies are planned.</p><p>In a dose-ranging trial, 776 adults with severe asthma that was uncontrolled despite medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids and a LABA who had experienced at least one asthma flare requiring systemic glucocorticoids or hospitalization in the prior year were randomly assigned to add-on therapy with one of four doses of subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupilumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dupilumab</a> or placebo for 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-agents-for-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Dupilumab resulted in significant increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> at week 12 in the overall group; the effect was somewhat greater in the prespecified subgroup with peripheral blood eosinophils &ge;300 per microL than in those with lower blood eosinophils. At 24 weeks, the increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> continued to be significant relative to placebo except for the lowest dose of dupilumab. Rates of severe asthma exacerbation were reduced in the groups receiving dupilumab every two weeks.

The study had four arms: tezepelumab 70 mg every four weeks (145 patients), 210 mg every four weeks (145 patients), 280 mg every two weeks (146 patients) or placebo (148 patients). After 52 weeks, the annualized asthma exacerbation rates were significantly lower in the three tezepelumab-treated groups, compared with the placebo group with decreases in exacerbation rates of 61 percent, 71 percent, and 66 percent versus the placebo group (p&lt;0.001 for all comparisons). Serious adverse effects included isolated cases of pneumonia, stroke, and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in the treatment arms. Further studies are needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a previous trial, 31 patients with mild allergic asthma were randomly assigned to receive AMG 157 (700 mg) or placebo intravenously, once a month for three doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-agents-for-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The primary outcome, the maximum percentage decrease in the FEV<sub>1</sub> during the late asthmatic response (three to seven hours after allergen inhalation), was 45.9 percent less in the AMG 157 group than the placebo group on day 84 (p = 0.02), but not significantly less after challenge on day 42. Other measures of allergic inflammation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> hyperresponsiveness, exhaled nitric oxide, blood and sputum eosinophils) were also decreased in the AMG group.

Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the predominant prostaglandin produced by mast cells and is also produced by Th2 lymphocytes and dendritic cells. It has bronchoconstrictive and chemokinetic effects that may contribute to asthma pathogenesis, such as being a potent eosinophil chemoattractant. PGD2 acts on the PGD2 receptor 2 (DP2 receptor) on mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. The DP2 receptor mediates migration of Th2 lymphocytes, delays Th2 cell apoptosis and stimulation of Th2 cells to produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13 among other effects.

The participants were randomly assigned to fevipiprant 225 mg or placebo orally twice a day for 12 weeks. The sputum eosinophil percentage decreased significantly from an initial geometric mean of 5.4 (95% CI 3.1-9.6) to 1.1 (95% CI 0.7-1.9) in the fevipiprant group and from 4.6 (95% CI 2.5-8.7) to 3.9 (95% CI 2.3-6.7) in the placebo group. Symptoms were assessed using the ACQ-7 questionnaire and were not different between groups. The quality of life questionnaire AQLQ score showed improvement in the fevipiprant group. A borderline benefit was noted in postbronchodilator, but not prebronchodilator, spirometry. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported.

It appears to suppress production of proinflammatory proteins (like traditional glucocorticoids), but with reduced adverse effects in animal models. An inhaled dry powder formulation of AZD5423 was assessed in a trial that randomly assigned 20 subjects with mild allergic asthma to pretreatment with AZD5423 (75 or 300 mcg daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (200 mcg twice daily), or placebo for seven days followed by allergen-bronchoprovocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-agents-for-asthma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. AZD5423 attenuated the fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> during the late phase asthmatic response compared with budesonide or placebo, but did not affect the early decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>. AZD5423 also decreased allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia and allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness at 24 hours, compared with placebo. AZD5423 inhalation was well-tolerated. However, due to the brief duration of the study, potential adverse effects associated with glucocorticoids were not fully evaluated. Additional studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of AZD5423 compared with inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4002221918\"><span class=\"h1\">AGENTS DIRECTED AT MAST CELLS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1663894286\"><span class=\"h2\">Tyrosine kinase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tyrosine kinase of the KIT proto-oncogene receptor mediates the activity of stem cell factor, the major survival and growth factor for mast cells.
