Because of such high success rates (over 90 percent for most populations), patient and viral features that historically predicted worse outcomes with interferon-based regimens have a limited impact on responses to combination DAA regimens. Rather than identify patients with a much lower chance of attaining cure (who thus might have forgone interferon-based therapy), such features influence treatment strategies with DAA regimens, such as duration of treatment and the need for the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>.</p><p>This topic reviews the patient and viral features that impact response to and selection of interferon-free combination DAA regimens for chronic HCV infection. The diagnosis of chronic HCV infection and the evaluation of patients prior to HCV treatment are discussed in detail separately.

Patient factors that were associated with worse response to interferon-based therapy included male gender, older age, high body mass index (BMI), advanced liver fibrosis, history of failed treatment, black race, non-CC IL28B genotype, and the presence of certain comorbid conditions, such as HIV coinfection, insulin resistance, or diabetes. Viral factors that were associated with worse response included non-genotype-2 infection, high viral load, and unfavorable viral kinetics during treatment (eg, slow decline or rebound in viral level).</p><p>With interferon-based therapies, these factors played a prominent role in management decisions, in three ways: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To estimate the likelihood of response to a given course of therapy and frame the discussion of whether treatment should be initiated or deferred for a given patient. Prominent predictors in this category included:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HCV genotype </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of prior HCV treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cirrhosis status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HIV coinfection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Baseline HCV RNA level</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To select the specific treatment regimen (eg, duration of interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> and dosing of ribavirin). HCV genotype (typically genotype 1 versus 2 or 3) was the main factor to inform this decision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To determine whether to discontinue treatment mid-course because of futility. On treatment viral response (ie, HCV RNA levels at weeks 12 and 24 of therapy) was the main factor to inform this decision. </p><p/><p>With interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, several of these traditional predictors of response are no longer relevant, and for those that remain relevant, the main role is to inform regimen selection and duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H885221443\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT IMPACT REGIMEN SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite universally high response rates to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, a number of &quot;traditional&quot; factors must still be considered prior to starting therapy for chronic HCV infection. The three most important factors are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral genotype and subtype (see <a href=\"#H910815977\" class=\"local\">'HCV genotype'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1192042535\" class=\"local\">'HCV subtype'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of cirrhosis (see <a href=\"#H2115165149\" class=\"local\">'Cirrhosis status'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCV treatment history (see <a href=\"#H4209120617\" class=\"local\">'Prior treatment failure'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Since DAA agents bind to and target the virus itself, pre-existing viral polymorphisms that confer resistance to these agents (termed resistance-associated substitutions [RASs]) have emerged as a new predictor of response to treatment. The impact of RASs is highly dependent on other patient and viral factors. (See <a href=\"#H2889683800\" class=\"local\">'Resistance-associated substitutions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H910815977\"><span class=\"h2\">HCV genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The viral genotype remains the most important factor in DAA regimen selection. Some DAA agents are genotype specific and have no or poor activity against other genotypes. While an increasing number of pan-genotypic DAA regimens are available, treatment approaches with these regimens (eg, duration and the need to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>) still vary by genotype. Specific regimen selection by genotype is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-4-5-and-6-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 4, 5, and 6 infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Genotype 1 virus is the most prevalent genotype worldwide, including in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F99796\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99796 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Development of novel therapies for chronic HCV infection had initially focused on genotype 1 infection, and so there are many highly effective DAA regimen options for this genotype. The viral subtype (1a versus 1b) has become critical for proper DAA regimen selection. (See <a href=\"#H1192042535\" class=\"local\">'HCV subtype'</a> below.)</p><p>Among non-genotype 1 infections, genotype 3 infection is the most significant predictor of a poor treatment response, particularly if the patient also has cirrhosis (see <a href=\"#H3803633163\" class=\"local\">'Role in genotype 3'</a> below). In studies of various DAA regimens, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates with genotype 3 infection are at least numerically lower than with other genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults#H1040153893\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3 infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Genotype 3'</a>.) </p><p>Genotype 2 infections respond to the same treatment regimens as genotype 3, with higher SVR rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5</a>]. Such infections are so responsive to DAA agents that it is unlikely that other baseline predictors will have any substantial impact on treatment responses with regimens for genotype 2 infection. As an example, in a study that evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-and-velpatasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> for 12 weeks in 238 genotype 2 infected patients, including a limited number of patients with cirrhosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prior treatment failure, 237 (99.6 percent) achieved SVR, with one patient discontinuing the study regimen prematurely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Data are limited on genotypes 4, 5, and 6; however, these genotypes do not appear to be associated with a significantly lower response than genotype 1 infection and respond similarly to the different regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1192042535\"><span class=\"h2\">HCV subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genotype 1 virus is divided into two major subtypes, 1a and 1b. Subtype 1a is the most common in the United States and is generally more difficult to treat. Genotype 1 subtype alone does not have a major impact on responses to nucleotide-based DAA regimens (eg, sofosbuvir-containing regimens), but response rates to protease inhibitor-based regimens (without a nucleotide inhibitor) tend to be slightly lower for subtype 1a compared with subtype 1b.</p><p>This is well illustrated by a trial evaluating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-plus-dasabuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir plus dasabuvir</a> given with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for 12 weeks in treatment-na&iuml;ve genotype 1 infected patients without cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For patients with subtype 1a, SVR rates were lower (and statistical inferiority was met) when the regimen was given without ribavirin (90 versus 97 percent with ribavirin), but for subtype 1b, SVR rates were identical regardless of ribavirin use (99 versus 99.5 percent with ribavirin). Similarly, in a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbasvir-and-grazoprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elbasvir-grazoprevir</a> for 12 weeks without ribavirin, SVR rates were lower for subtype 1a versus subtype 1b infected patients (92 versus 99 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of the 13 virologic failures in this study, 10 were in subtype 1a infected patients, and the presence of NS5A RASs accounted for most of the decreased response with this subtype. (See <a href=\"#H2889683800\" class=\"local\">'Resistance-associated substitutions'</a> below.) </p><p>In contrast, there is no evidence that subtype alone affects response to nucleotide-based (eg, sofosbuvir-containing) DAA regimens, which are similar between subtype 1a and 1b (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109906\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109906 \">table 1</a>). Thus, for such regimens, decisions on duration and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> depend predominantly on other predictors, such as fibrosis stage and prior treatment experience. However, in certain circumstances, such as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simeprevir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or treatment-experienced patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ledipasvir-and-sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the presence of certain polymorphisms, which are more common in subtype 1a than 1b virus, can affect response and treatment selection. (See <a href=\"#H2889683800\" class=\"local\">'Resistance-associated substitutions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2115165149\"><span class=\"h2\">Cirrhosis status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the stage of liver fibrosis for a given patient is a critical component of HCV management, both to select the appropriate antiviral regimen and to ensure that appropriate medical evaluations and cancer screenings are undertaken.

The exception is patients with chronic genotype 3 infection, in whom cirrhosis is the predominant feature associated with poor response, which thus far cannot be completely overcome by the extension of therapy or the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3803633163\" class=\"local\">'Role in genotype 3'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism behind impaired treatment response in patients with cirrhosis is uncertain but may involve altered drug <span class=\"nowrap\">delivery/metabolism</span> and an increased risk of drug toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-response-to-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3563274874\"><span class=\"h3\">Role in genotype 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For genotype 1 infection, as long as appropriate regimen adjustments (eg, increasing the duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>) are made, patients with cirrhosis can achieve similar response rates to those without cirrhosis. For some genotype 1 regimens, cirrhosis has no substantial impact and does not warrant regimen modification.

This negative impact of cirrhosis was largely abrogated by the addition of ribavirin (SVR rate 96 percent) or the extension of therapy to 24 weeks (SVR rate 98 percent), which resulted in response rates comparable with those observed among patients without cirrhosis.

Nevertheless, unless multiple other negative predictors of response are present, high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates can be achieved for all genotypes through optimal regimen selection and modification.
