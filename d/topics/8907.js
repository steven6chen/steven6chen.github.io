An estimated 6 in 1000 United States children between the age of 12 and 17 are currently abusing inhalants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Unlike nearly all other classes of drugs, their use is most common among younger adolescents with use peaking between seventh and ninth grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The incidence of inhalant abuse in children 12 to 18 years old has fluctuated over the past 25 years. Incidence of use tripled between 1983 and 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], peaking in 1995, and then showed a steady decline until 2002. Incidence was unchanged for the next 11 years but showed a significant decrease in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Unlike other drugs of abuse, male and female adolescents report a similar rate of inhalant abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the past, Native American children and those residing in rural areas were at higher risk for inhalant abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. However, rates of abuse have fallen steadily in these groups and are now at levels comparable to the general population. Education on prevention and treatment is thought to be responsible for this trend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Similar to national survey data, exposures in 12 to 17 year old patients reported to United States regional poison control centers declined from 73 cases per million in 1993 to 33 cases per million in 2003, and the peak age of exposure was 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among all patients, there were 167 deaths out of 35,453 exposures between 1993 and 2008. Butane, propane, and air fresheners were associated with the highest fatality rate. Males comprised 73 percent of all cases reported to poison centers suggesting that boys may have riskier inhalant abuse behaviors. In the United Kingdom, deaths due to volatile substance abuse peaked in the early 1990s and subsequently have declined after education campaigns and laws prohibiting cigarette lighter refills went into effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated significant mental health and behavioral comorbidities among patients who are inhalant abusers. They are more likely to have an episode of major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15</a>], suicidality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], conduct disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and are at an increased risk for future drug abuse problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volatile hydrocarbons and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> have a similar mechanism of action. Like ethanol and other inhalational anesthetic agents, they are highly lipid soluble. They are rapidly absorbed across the pulmonary bed into the bloodstream and are distributed throughout the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Neurons, which have high lipid content, are particularly susceptible to the solvent properties of these compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>These inhalants act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depression is thought to be mediated by alteration of neuronal membrane function at glutamate or gamma amino butyric acid receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>These inhalants produce an effect within seconds that typically lasts 15 to 45 minutes. There have been rare cases of prolonged symptoms when large quantities have been inhaled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Initial euphoria is followed by lethargy. Judgment and coordination are impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Intoxication is maintained through repeated use. Symptoms of tolerance to the effects of inhalants and physiologic withdrawal have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Nitrites produce their pleasurable effects by intense vasodilation which produces a sensation of heat and warmth. Absorption is rapid across the pulmonary bed leading to onset of hypotension and reflex tachycardia within seconds of inhalation. Effects are brief, lasting less than five minutes. Nitrites are also used to enhance sexual pleasure by prolonging penile erection and promoting anal sphincter relaxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES (SNIFFING, HUFFING, OR BAGGING)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the most frequently used inhalants include glue, shoe polish, or toluene (30 percent); gasoline or lighter fluid (25 percent); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> or &quot;whippets&quot; (25 percent); and spray paint (23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each of these substances may contain more than one toxic compound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75970\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75970 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Inhalants may be sniffed directly from a container or sprayed directly on to a heated surface to enhance vaporization (&quot;sniffing&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Volatile liquid substances also may be inhaled from a saturated cloth that is held under the nose or near the mouth (&quot;huffing&quot;), or from a bag that is placed over the mouth, nose, or head (&quot;bagging&quot;). The risk of asphyxia is increased with bagging because the partial pressure of hydrocarbon displaces oxygen in the alveoli. The possibility of a suicide attempt should be considered in an individual who &quot;bags&quot; inhalants, particularly when the bag is placed over the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The concentration of the inhaled substance increases from sniffing, to huffing, to bagging.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a> is abused most commonly as &quot;whippets&quot;. These are small, cylindrical metal bulbs with a pierceable end that contains compressed nitrous oxide, which are meant for use as a propellant for whipped cream makers. When misused, the end is pierced with a &quot;cracker&quot; and the escaping gas is captured in a balloon and then inhaled. Nitrous oxide can also be sniffed from whipped cream canisters.</p><p>The desired effects of inhalant abuse include euphoria, lightheadedness, and a general state of intoxication similar to that produced by alcohol or marijuana. The effects usually last for only 15 to 30 minutes, but can be sustained by continuous or repeated use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOGNITION OF INHALANT ABUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalant abuse frequently goes undetected. Clues to inhalant abuse include chemical odors on the breath, skin, or clothes, and empty solvent containers or bags, rags, or gauze in the child's possession or trash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. &quot;Glue-sniffer's rash&quot; is an eczematoid dermatitis with erythema, inflammatory changes, and pruritus that occurs in the perioral area and extends to the midface. It is caused by the drying effects of hydrocarbons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Symptoms and signs of inhalant use are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62589\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62589 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TOXICITY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS BY AGENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the vast majority of children who abuse volatile inhalant substances do not seek or require medical attention, inhalant abuse is potentially life-threatening. Death may result from asphyxia, suffocation, choking on vomitus, careless or dangerous behavior in potentially dangerous settings, and sudden sniffing death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] seen with hydrocarbon abuse, especially halogenated hydrocarbons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrocarbons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Household products abused as inhalants typically contain a mixture of hydrocarbons. They are categorized by structure: aliphatic, aromatic, and halogenated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocarbon-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocarbon poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aliphatic compounds are straight-chain compounds and include butane, propane, kerosene, and mineral seal oil. Gasoline is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons that also may contain other substances, such as xylene, toluene, benzene, naphthalene, or lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32</a>].</p><p>Aromatic hydrocarbons are cyclic compounds containing a benzene ring and are used as industrial solvents; benzene, toluene, and xylene are encountered most commonly. Toluene is found in a large number of household products including glues, adhesives, acrylic paints, paint thinners, and automotive products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Halogenated hydrocarbons include fluorinated hydrocarbons (freons) and chlorinated hydrocarbons (carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, trichloroethane). They are used as solvents, degreasers, and spot removers, and in the dry cleaning industry. Freons are widely used as refrigerants and in fire extinguishers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>The most important toxicities are cardiac and neurological, although hydrocarbons are toxic to essentially all body systems. Certain agents are more closely associated with a particular toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">CNS effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute CNS effects include slurred speech, ataxia, disorientation, headache, hallucinations, agitation, violent behavior, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,36-39</a>].

Toluene intoxication can cause temporary or progressive cerebellar dysfunction and cranial neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>].</p><p>The long-term CNS effects are equally worrisome and include neurocognitive impairment, cerebellar dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28,39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,39,41</a>]. The neurologic findings may be related to loss of brain mass or abnormal perfusion. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of inhalant users demonstrates loss of brain mass and degeneration of white matter (also called &quot;toxic leukoencephalopathy&quot;), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].

Chronic heavy use of toluene has been reported to result in a statistically significant increase in QT dispersal, a marker for sudden death in a variety of clinical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>&quot;Sudden sniffing death&quot; where a patient has cardiovascular collapse associated with inhalation of volatile compound has been reported with all classes of hydrocarbon, but is most commonly seen in children who abuse halogenated hydrocarbons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31,39,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39,55</a>]. Although a rare event, it is unpredictable and can occur in first time users. Commonly, it follows exertion or masturbation, both of which lead to increased catecholamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,56</a>]. It is thought to be due to sensitization of the myocardium to catecholamines that is possibly accentuated by hypoxia associated with inhalant abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,30,31,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,31,40</a>]. The cellular basis of this cardiac &ldquo;sensitization&rdquo; is poorly understood but may relate to toxic effects on rapid delayed-rectifier potassium channels, which results in an increase in QT duration and dispersion, and thus, susceptibility to catecholamine&ndash;induced delayed after-depolarizations and ventricular dysrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other effects</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary effects</strong> &ndash; Hypoxia may result from displacement of oxygen in the alveoli, particularly with butane, isobutane, propane, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], or suffocation when the patient huffs using a plastic bag.
