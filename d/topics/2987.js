Patients commonly experience pain, paresthesia, and less commonly, weakness in the median nerve distribution. CTS is the most common compressive focal mononeuropathy seen in clinical practice.</p><p>This topic review will discuss treatment of CTS. We will also briefly review the etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of CTS, which are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The carpal tunnel is formed by the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum) superiorly and the carpal bones inferiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59856 \">figure 1</a>). The median nerve, accompanied by the nine flexor tendons of the forearm musculature, must pass through this anatomic tunnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53265 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of CTS is multifactorial. Increased pressure in the intracarpal canal is thought to play a key role in the development of clinical CTS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>The hallmark of classic CTS is pain or paresthesia (numbness and tingling) in a distribution that includes the median nerve territory, with involvement of the first three digits and the radial half of the fourth digit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70720\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70720 \">figure 3</a>). The symptoms are typically worse at night and characteristically awaken affected patients from sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CTS is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>CTS is a clinical diagnosis that is suspected when the characteristic symptoms and signs are present. The most important of these are nocturnal pain or paresthesia in the distribution of the median nerve. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) are useful to support the diagnosis of CTS and to rule out other abnormalities. The electrodiagnosis of CTS rests upon the demonstration of impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in the context of normal conduction elsewhere. EMG is used to exclude other conditions such as polyneuropathy, plexopathy, and radiculopathy. In addition, CTS severity is partially judged by the amount and chronicity of denervation noted on EMG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Electrodiagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1551280031\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the management of patients diagnosed with CTS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F115055\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115055 \">algorithm 1</a>) is based upon the acuity and severity of clinical symptoms and the degree of neurogenic injury as assessed by electrodiagnostic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Electrodiagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p>In general, splinting, glucocorticoid injections, and oral glucocorticoids are useful for symptom relief of CTS, but surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with evidence of ongoing nerve damage in the absence of a reversible etiology.</p><p>A variety of patient factors including heredity, size of the carpal tunnel, associated local and systemic diseases, and habits may contribute to the etiology of CTS. Evaluation and treatment of potential predisposing conditions, including obesity, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases, and thyroid disease, is warranted in patients with CTS, although there is no proof that treating these conditions will improve the symptoms or the course of CTS.

Those who lack evidence of significant axonal loss or denervation can be treated initially with nonsurgical measures.</p><p>For patients with a clinical diagnosis of CTS who have not had electrodiagnostic studies, initial nonsurgical therapy is reasonable if clinical symptoms are mild (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F115057\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115057 \">table 1</a>). However, those with moderate to severe clinical symptoms who are candidates for surgery should have electrodiagnostic studies first to determine if there is significant axonal loss that might prompt a surgical referral, or if another etiology for median nerve damage can be determined. Patients lacking the electrodiagnostic features of axon loss can be treated initially with nonsurgical measures, even in the presence of severe clinical symptoms.</p><p>Among nonsurgical treatments, we recommend nocturnal wrist splinting in the neutral position as initial therapy in preference to other nonsurgical measures because limited evidence suggests it is effective for short-term symptom relief. It is also safe and well-tolerated. Referral to an occupational therapist with subspecialty certification in hand therapy may improve outcomes.

For patients who comply with nocturnal splinting but remain symptomatic at one month, we suggest continuation of splinting for another one to two months while adding a different nonsurgical modality for CTS rather than stopping splinting. We suggest adding a single injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (40 mg) as the next therapeutic option; for patients who decline injection therapy, we suggest adding oral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 20 mg daily for 10 to 14 days). Oral glucocorticoid treatment should not extend beyond four weeks duration because of the deleterious side effects of prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid injection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who decline treatment with glucocorticoids, we suggest adding treatment with other measures such as physical and occupational therapy techniques (eg, carpal bone mobilization or nerve gliding) or yoga if available.

Surgical decompression may be beneficial even for patients with CTS who lack evidence of axonal loss or denervation if symptoms do not respond to and adequate trial of nonsurgical measures. (See <a href=\"#H286270\" class=\"local\">'Surgical decompression'</a> below.)</p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained prior to surgical treatment (if not already performed) in order to confirm the diagnosis of CTS and to assess severity.

Patients with severe CTS who had electrodiagnostic evidence of denervation were excluded. Nonsurgical treatment involved multimodal interventions; patients were offered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, hand therapy sessions including tendon gliding, and continued splinting at night; ultrasound was offered to those who did not respond by six weeks. Assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.</p><p>On intention-to-treat analysis at 12 months, both groups showed improvement, but patients assigned to surgery had a significantly better mean functional score on the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Assessment Questionnaire (CTSAQ) than those assigned to nonsurgical therapy (-0.4, 95% CI 0.11-0.70) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, the surgery group had greater mean improvement in the CTSAQ symptoms score (-0.34, 95% CI 0.02-0.65). However, the difference for scores of functional status and symptoms between the two groups was small and of modest clinical significance.</p><p>Additional evidence supporting the utility of surgery comes from a study that systematically reviewed 209 articles published from 2000 to 2006 with patient-reported outcomes for 32,936 operations for CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

A 2012 systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] found only two low-quality trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>] that evaluated nocturnal wrist splinting versus no treatment. Based on this limited evidence, the review concluded that nocturnal use of wrist splints is more effective than no treatment for short-term symptom benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Clinical features that may favor a long-term clinical response to splinting are shorter duration of symptoms (one year or less) and less severe nocturnal paresthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similarly, when splinting and glucocorticoid injections (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid injection'</a> below) are combined, symptom duration of less than three months and absence of sensory impairment at presentation may be predictive of a lasting response to nonsurgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Splints are usually worn at night, but they can be worn continuously.

There was less rapid, but more complete and longer lasting relief of symptoms with surgery than splinting. At one month, complete or marked improvement was seen in 29 percent treated with surgery versus 42 percent treated with splinting. However, at one year, complete or marked improvement was seen in 92 percent treated with surgery versus 72 percent treated with splinting. In the systematic review of this trial, significantly more patients experienced clinical improvement at three months with surgery than with splinting (71 versus 51.6 percent) with a relative risk (RR) for clinical improvement favoring surgery of 1.38 (95% CI 1.08-1.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Pooled data for clinical improvement at one year also favored surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.53) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

At two weeks following the initial injection, significantly more of the glucocorticoid-injected than sham-injected patients were &quot;somewhat or highly satisfied&quot; (70 versus 34 percent, respectively). When nonresponders to sham injection subsequently received a betamethasone injection, the proportion reporting improvement was 73 percent. In an uncontrolled extension of this trial, only 4 of 46 patients (9 percent) whose CTS symptoms improved following an initial injection had good symptomatic control for up to 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

For patients who have recurrent symptoms after two injections, we suggest other nonsurgical treatments (if not already tried) or surgical evaluation. Glucocorticoids can be injected proximal to or distal to the carpal tunnel. Injections appear to be generally safe. However, injection therapy is associated with several risks, including exacerbation of median nerve compression, accidental injection into the median or ulnar nerves, and digital flexor tendon rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid injection versus surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery appears to be more effective for sustained relief of symptoms from CTS than local glucocorticoid injection. While short-term results of glucocorticoid injection may be better than those following carpal tunnel release surgery, the advantage is lost over the course of one year following the procedure. These points are illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One prospective, open study randomly assigned 163 patients with symptomatic CTS to glucocorticoid injection into the carpal tunnel (20 mg of paramethasone acetonide) or surgical release (via a limited palmar incision) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The main outcome was the proportion of patients in each group who had at least 20 percent improvement in nocturnal paresthesia. Significantly more subjects assigned to injection than surgery were improved at three months (approximately 95 versus 75 percent, respectively). Over the ensuing nine months of observation, the advantage of injection over surgery was lost, while those treated surgically generally maintained the degree of improvement noted at the three-month point. The patients in this study were predominantly Spanish housewives, and compensation for disability due to CTS was rarely an issue. Thus, the applicability of these results to patients with work-related CTS is uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent assessor-blinded controlled trial randomly assigned 50 patients (48 were female) with CTS to a single injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 15 mg or open surgical carpal tunnel decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. At 20 weeks, surgical treatment led to significantly greater symptomatic improvement in the global symptom score (GSS) score, the primary outcome, than local glucocorticoid injection (24.2 versus 8.7, respectively). In addition, surgical treatment resulted in significantly greater improvements in electrophysiologic outcomes (distal motor latency and sensory nerve conduction velocity) of the median nerve. The dose of methylprednisolone (15 mg) used in the trial is much less than the 40 mg most commonly used in practice.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral glucocorticoids appear to be effective for short-term improvement of CTS symptoms. In a 2003 systematic review, analysis of pooled data from three trials of high and moderate methodologic quality showed that two weeks of oral glucocorticoid treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in symptoms as measured by the GSS compared with placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD] -7.23; 95% CI -10.31 to -4.14); one trial showed that four weeks of oral glucocorticoid treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in symptoms (WMD -10.8; 95% CI -15.26 to -6.34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>There are only limited data regarding the long-term effect of oral glucocorticoids for CTS treatment. In one clinical trial that evaluated two to four weeks of treatment with up to 20 mg per day of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, patients showed clinical and electrodiagnostic improvement for up to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, this study did not have a placebo control group. In another clinical trial, 60 patients treated with oral prednisolone 25 mg daily for 10 days showed symptomatic improvement in CTS for up to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, oral prednisolone was less effective than glucocorticoid injection. In a placebo-controlled trial that evaluated 60 patients with mild to moderate CTS, two weeks of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (20 mg daily for seven days, followed by 10 mg per day for seven days) was associated with significant improvement in symptoms as measured by the GSS, but the benefit gradually waned over eight weeks of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1465459420\"><span class=\"h2\">Other nonsurgical options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited and low-quality data suggest that yoga and carpal bone mobilization may be reasonable alternative options for conservative treatment if available. Unproven CTS treatments include nerve-gliding maneuvers, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, low-level laser therapy, magnetic therapy, contrast baths, and myofascial massage. Ineffective CTS treatments include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>, and diuretics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perineural dextrose injections</strong> &ndash; The possible benefit of perineural dextrose injections is supported by the results of a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 49 subjects with mild-to-moderate CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Subjects assigned to the D5W group received one perineural injection of 5 percent dextrose solution (5 cc) under ultrasound guidance, delivered to separate the median nerve from the flexor retinaculum, connective tissue, and flexor tendons through hydrodissection. Subjects assigned to the control group received one injection of normal saline (5 cc) in a similar fashion. At six months, with data from 30 wrists in each group, the D5W group compared with the control group showed a reduction in pain and disability, improved electrophysiologic parameters, and decreased cross-sectional area of the median nerve. Small sample size and short-term follow-up limit the strength of these findings, which require confirmation in larger trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Yoga</strong> &ndash; Limited evidence suggests that yoga may be beneficial for pain control in patients with CTS. A preliminary assessor-blinded controlled trial randomly assigned 42 patients with CTS to eight weeks of treatment with yoga or wrist splinting. The yoga intervention consisted of 11 yoga postures designed for strengthening, stretching, and balancing each joint in the upper body along with relaxation given twice weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients in the yoga group had statistically significant pain reduction compared with patients in the wrist splint group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carpal bone mobilization</strong> &ndash; Carpal bone mobilization is a physical and occupational therapy technique that involves movement of the bones and joints in the wrist. Data are limited, but a small unblinded trial involving 21 people found that carpal bone mobilization significantly improved symptoms (assessed using a symptom diary with a visual analog scale) after three weeks compared with no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. However, there was no significant benefit in hand function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerve gliding</strong> &ndash; Nerve and tendon gliding exercises or maneuvers are performed under the direction of an occupational therapist with subspecialty certification in hand therapy. Nerve gliding is predicated on restoring normal movement of the median nerve. It is thought that nerve compression may lead to &quot;tethering&quot; of the median nerve, resulting in decreased nerve excursion and increased mechanical strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

As an example, a prospective, randomized, unblinded trial involving 36 patients found that nerve and tendon gliding exercises for four weeks provided no statistically significant benefit at eight weeks compared with wrist splinting for symptom improvement or patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A subsequent assessor-blinded trial of 120 women with long-standing CTS compared physical therapy (nerve gliding and soft tissue mobilization maneuvers) with surgery and found that the two treatments resulted in similar outcomes at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound therapy</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound and electrical stimulation have been used to promote recovery after nerve and tendon injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Ultrasound is used to promote soft tissue healing and the transdermal delivery of medications at intensities ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">watt/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. At its lower intensity range, ultrasound induces changes in cell permeability, termed &quot;microstreaming,&quot; that are thought to enhance the healing response. At its upper range, ultrasound raises tissue temperature while reducing pain, increases tissue elasticity, and decreases tissue viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Data regarding the benefit of ultrasound for CTS are conflicting, although its effectiveness may depend on the duration of therapy.

An analysis of pooled data from two trials with 63 participants found that ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not significantly beneficial. In one of these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], ultrasound treatment for seven weeks led to significant symptom improvement at six months, but a high loss to follow-up renders this finding inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effectiveness of ultrasound may depend on the characteristics of the ultrasound used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37</a>].
