It is manifested by tachypnea, nasal flaring, intercostal or subcostal retractions, audible grunting, and cyanosis. Neonatal respiratory distress may be transient; however, persistent distress requires a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to optimize outcome and minimize morbidity.</p><p>This topic review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical features, and approach to initial management of three common respiratory disorders of perinatal transition: transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). These disorders, including their specific management, are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient tachypnea of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSITION FROM FETAL LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The successful transition from fetal to neonatal life at delivery requires a series of rapid physiologic changes of the cardiorespiratory system. These changes result in redirection of gas exchange from the placenta to the lung, and comprise:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replacement of alveolar fluid with air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of regular breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in pulmonary blood flow as a result of increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)</p><p/><p>These processes result in an increase in neonatal arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) from 25 to a range of 60 to 80 mmHg during the first minutes of life. This increase in PaO<sub>2</sub> reverses hypoxic respiratory depression and contributes to a regular breathing pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although most neonates successfully transition between intrauterine and extrauterine life, approximately 10 percent will have difficulty and require resuscitative efforts at birth. This difficulty may be a consequence of impaired lung function due to fluid retention, airway obstruction associated with congenital anomalies, persistent pulmonary hypertension, or apnea associated with lack of respiratory effort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-apnea-of-prematurity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of apnea of prematurity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life, including its difficulties, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-transition-from-intrauterine-to-extrauterine-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of the common causes of neonatal respiratory distress is reviewed briefly here. A more detailed discussion for each disorder is found separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTN is caused by failure of adequate lung fluid clearance at birth, resulting in excess lung liquid. The liquid fills the air spaces and moves into the extra-alveolar interstitium, where it pools in perivascular tissues and interlobar fissures until it is cleared by the lymphatic or vascular circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient tachypnea of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the precise pathogenesis of TTN remains unknown, it is proposed that TTN is caused by <strong>impairment</strong> of the following mechanisms that normally clear fetal alveolar fluid:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, which increases sodium reabsorption, thereby creating an osmotic gradient for water uptake across the pulmonary epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The ability to reabsorb sodium appears relatively late in fetal life. Low pulmonary expression or activity of airway epithelial sodium channels may delay lung fluid clearance, especially in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung inflation that generates a transepithelial hydrostatic pressure gradient, which promotes fluid movement of liquid from the airway. This is consistent with the finding that positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) facilitates airway liquid clearance and lung aeration in animal models mechanically ventilated from birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The excess lung water in TTN causes decreased pulmonary compliance, and possibly increased airway resistance due to extrinsic compression of small airways by fluid in the extra-alveolar interstitium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RDS is caused by deficiency of surfactant, the phospholipid mixture (predominantly desaturated palmitoyl phosphatidyl choline) that reduces alveolar surface tension, which decreases the pressure needed to keep the alveoli inflated, and maintains alveolar stability. When surfactant is deficient, the infant may not be able to generate the increased inspiratory pressure needed to inflate alveolar units, resulting in the development of progressive and diffuse atelectasis. Surfactant deficiency also leads to an inability to maintain open alveoli at low lung volume, for example, during end expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Diffuse atelectasis leads to low compliance and low functional residual capacity. Hypoxemia results primarily from mismatching of ventilation and perfusion as blood bypasses atelectatic air spaces (intrapulmonary shunting). Right-to-left shunting that occurs through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, because of increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), also contributes to decreased oxygenation. Hypoxemia is often accompanied by respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although surfactant deficiency plays the major etiologic role for neonatal RDS, the inability to clear lung fluid from air spaces may also contribute to RDS in the preterm infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, data from a twin cohort study demonstrate a significant genetic susceptibility to RDS, although the underlying genetic component(s) remains to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPHN is caused by the abnormal persistence of elevated PVR that leads to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus, resulting in hypoxemia.</p><p>The normal transition from fetal life must include a dramatic decrease in PVR. This is mediated by mechanical factors that result in the opening of air spaces and improved oxygenation, and decrease pulmonary vasoconstriction. The balance of vascular mediators (ie, endothelin and nitric oxide, which induce vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation, respectively) also plays a key role in changing pulmonary vascular tone.</p><p>It has been proposed that PPHN is caused by a combination of underdevelopment, maldevelopment, or maladaptation of the pulmonary vascular bed. PPHN is also often associated with nonacute conditions due to a structural abnormality (eg, congenital diaphragmatic hernia) or chronic in utero stress (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome). These concurrent findings suggest that a structural etiology (eg, increased musculature of pulmonary vessels), rather than simply a functional change in pulmonary vascular reactivity at birth, contributes to PPHN in many cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic clinical features help distinguish among the disorders that result in respiratory distress immediately after birth, although there can be considerable overlap among these conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74233\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74233 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTN is most frequently seen in late preterm infants born at a gestational age between 34 and 37 weeks, many of whom are delivered by elective caesarean section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Term and postterm babies are also at risk for TTN.</p><p>The onset of TTN usually occurs within two hours after delivery. Tachypnea (respiratory rate &ge;60 breaths per minute) is the most prominent feature. Affected infants also may have increased work of breathing manifested by nasal flaring, mild intercostal and subcostal retractions, and expiratory grunting (the sound produced by expiration through partially closed vocal cords). These signs of respiratory distress are generally mild and often resolve more quickly than tachypnea. Cyanosis may be present and is usually corrected with low concentrations of supplemental oxygen. Respiratory acidosis, if present, is mild. While TTN frequently resolves within 24 hours, a persistent course of up to 72 hours is not uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient tachypnea of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with RDS are nearly always preterm. Respiratory distress (ie, tachypnea and labored breathing) and cyanosis occur at or soon after birth. Typical signs include grunting (which prevents end-expiratory alveolar collapse), nasal flaring (which reduces nasal resistance and reflects increased use of accessory muscles of respiration), and intercostal and subcostal retractions (due to decreased lung compliance and the highly compliant chest wall). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The characteristic clinical course of RDS is observed less frequently because of interventions that reduce the risk of RDS. These include the use of antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, early intubation for surfactant therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> administration of continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the delivery room to provide adequate lung volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neonatal-respiratory-distress-disorders-of-transition/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As a result of these measures, many extremely low birth weight (ELBW; BW &lt;1000 g) infants do not exhibit the clinical features of RDS, even though they are at considerable risk for later development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPHN usually occurs in term infants, although it may also present in late preterm or postterm infants. Although the diagnosis is rare in very low birth weight (VLBW; BW &lt;1500 g) infants, PPHN may dominate the clinical picture of respiratory distress in a small number of VLBW infants.</p><p>PPHN is characterized by tachypnea and cyanosis. Differential pre- and postductal saturation is a common finding (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac evaluation'</a> below). It may also be accompanied by a systolic murmur of tricuspid insufficiency. Sepsis, hypoxia-ischemia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia are associated with PPHN. In these cases, metabolic acidosis may be present due to lactic acidosis from poor perfusion or severe hypoxemia, in addition to the respiratory acidosis that accompanies respiratory failure.

PPHN also is more likely in infants with a history of bacterial infection, poor intrauterine growth, and nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, suggesting poor placental function and chronic fetal hypoxemia. Although the presence of respiratory distress and precipitating factor(s) are clinical findings that help distinguish PPHN from structural cyanotic heart disease in term infants with severe cyanosis, the diagnosis should be confirmed by echocardiography.

Clinical findings include tachypnea, nasal flaring, intercostal or subcostal retractions, audible grunting, and cyanosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal respiratory distress commonly occurs because of a poor transition from fetal to neonatal life due to impaired lung function, persistent pulmonary hypertension, airway obstruction, or lack of respiratory effort. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transition from fetal life'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three most common causes of respiratory distress are transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Clinical and radiographic findings, and disease course are used to differentiate the three and make an initial diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>TTN</strong> is typically seen in late preterm infants, although term and postterm infants are also at risk. It is caused by inadequate lung fluid clearance at birth that results in excess lung fluid, which leads to decreased pulmonary compliance and possibly increased airway resistance. TTN is characterized by the onset of tachypnea usually within two hours after delivery. Symptoms generally resolve after 12 to 24 hours, but may persist as long as 72 hours in severe cases. The chest radiograph typically exhibits bilateral perihilar linear streaking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient tachypnea of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>RDS</strong> typically occurs in preterm infants, and its incidence increases with decreasing gestational age. It is caused by surfactant deficiency that leads to alveolar collapse and diffuse atelectasis. Hypoxemia results from the mismatch of ventilation and perfusion as blood bypasses the atelectatic air spaces. Respiratory distress and cyanosis occur at or soon after birth. The chest radiograph is characterized by low lung volumes and the classical findings of a diffuse, reticulogranular, ground glass appearance with air bronchograms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52323\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52323 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>PPHN</strong> usually occurs in term infants, although it may also present in late preterm or postterm infants. It is caused by the abnormal persistence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that leads to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus, resulting in hypoxemia. PPHN is characterized by severe cyanosis and tachypnea, and may be accompanied by a systolic murmur of tricuspid insufficiency. The appearance of the chest radiograph in PPHN depends upon the presence of associated lung disease. In infants without lung disease, the lung fields may appear clear with decreased pulmonary vascularity, and the heart size may be normal or increased. Echocardiography is required to confirm the diagnosis of PPHN and differentiate it from structural cyanotic heart disease.
