Fertility in SLE patients does not appear to be altered by disease itself; however, a decrease in ovarian reserve can occur in women exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>.</p><p>Pregnancy in women with SLE carries a higher maternal and fetal risk compared with pregnancy in healthy women. The prognosis for both mother and child is best when SLE has been quiescent for at least six months prior to the pregnancy. Disease flares during SLE pregnancy pose challenges with respect to distinguishing physiologic changes related to pregnancy from disease-related manifestations. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach with close medical, obstetric, and neonatal monitoring is necessary to optimize both maternal and fetal outcomes.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the major risks associated with pregnancy in SLE patients, as well as management recommendations. Issues related to menstrual function, menopause, estrogen replacement therapy, and the use of oral contraceptives in women with systemic lupus erythematosus are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menstrual-function-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menstrual function, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to contraception in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>).

Active SLE at the time of conception is a strong predictor of adverse maternal and obstetrical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In spite of this risk, the majority of such pregnancies still result in live births. The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest observational study, including 385 pregnant lupus patients with inactive or mild or moderate disease at conception, found 81 percent of subjects had uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After controlling for baseline risk factors such as lupus anticoagulant, treatment for hypertension, thrombocytopenia, disease flare, or moderate disease activity at baseline, non-Hispanic white patients had an 8 percent rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the study population was limited as it excluded women with high disease activity, active lupus nephritis, uncontrolled hypertension, and diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 267 pregnancies in a cohort of lupus patients found that women with high disease activity compared with low disease activity in the first and second trimesters showed a threefold increase in pregnancy loss (miscarriages and perinatal mortality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, overall there was no statistically significant difference in the number of live births between the women with high disease activity compared with low disease activity (77 percent versus 88 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Our approach to pregnancy planning and management in SLE is generally consistent with recommendations developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158720001\"><span class=\"h2\">Preconception evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preconception assessment is essential in women with SLE to determine whether pregnancy may pose an unacceptably high maternal or fetal risk, to initiate interventions to optimize disease activity, and to adjust medications to those that are least harmful to the fetus.</p><p>Women should be advised that discontinuation of medications used to control disease activity increases the risk of lupus flare and pregnancy complications. Ideally, women considering conception should be maintained on medications that are compatible with pregnancy and should continue these medications in pregnancy. Clinical features specific to pregnancy in the setting of SLE are discussed below. A more general discussion on preconception care and risk assessment in all women is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-preconception-office-visit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The preconception office visit&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452135627\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preconception evaluation in women with SLE should include an assessment of disease activity and major organ involvement, as well as hypercoagulability or concurrent medical disorders that may impact pregnancy. Previous obstetric outcomes should be reviewed, with particular attention paid to history of small for gestational age fetus, preeclampsia, stillbirth, miscarriage, and preterm birth. An approach to the assessment of disease activity and severity of SLE is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Assessment of disease activity and severity'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with evidence of active SLE, especially lupus nephritis, should be advised to defer pregnancy until the disease is well controlled for at least six months. For those with renal insufficiency, counseling should include an assessment of the risk of temporary or permanent decline in renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increased severity of maternal disease generally correlates with higher maternal and fetal risk in pregnancy. Thus, recent stroke, cardiac involvement, pulmonary hypertension, severe interstitial lung disease, and advanced renal insufficiency can be dangerous to both mother and fetus. Women with these or other worrisome medical conditions should be counseled carefully by a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist as to their individual risk profile, with clear discussion of the morbidity and mortality risks to both mother and fetus associated with pregnancy. Alternatives such as surrogacy and adoption should be presented. Should they elect to pursue pregnancy, they should be followed in a multidisciplinary fashion in a high-risk center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Specific maternal antibody status such as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/La</span> should be assessed. aPLs may increase obstetric risks such as recurrent pregnancy loss, stillbirths, and preeclampsia while antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/La</span> predispose to neonatal lupus (NL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Although some medications used to treat SLE are potentially harmful or contraindicated during pregnancy, there are safe options. Information regarding the use of immunosuppressive agents in pregnant patients with SLE can be found below, and in a separate topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>).

A randomized trial including 20 consecutive pregnant patients with SLE found no differences between disease flare rates, but patients in the HCQ group were able to reduce the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dosage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, the HCQ group had significantly lower disease activity scores after delivery compared with the placebo group. Findings from a larger prospective study with 257 pregnancies in 197 women also found that discontinuation of HCQ during pregnancy was associated with a higher rate of flare compared with women who either continued HCQ during pregnancy or never took it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, high disease activity occurred in twice as many pregnancies in which HCQ was stopped compared with those who continued taking HCQ.

However, the use of NSAIDs may impede ovulation or implantation and is best avoided during a conception cycle. There is conflicting evidence as to whether exposure to NSAIDs during the first trimester increases the risk of spontaneous abortion. After the first trimester, NSAIDs may be used until 32 weeks of gestation. As transient oligohydramnios has been reported with daily use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>, these medications should be used judiciously.

These patients require additional vigilance, as the presentation of hypertension, proteinuria, or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation is concerning for development of preeclampsia. Severe, early-onset growth restriction is similarly concerning for developing preeclampsia. While preeclampsia presenting later in pregnancy can often be managed expectantly, in pre-and peri-viable gestations, delivery is indicated to prevent catastrophic maternal complications. For this reason, early diagnosis is essential.</p><p>In women at elevated risk of preeclampsia, including all women with SLE, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> has been shown to reduce the risk of disease by approximately 24 percent when initiated between 12 to 16 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-prevention#H65619565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Candidates'</a> and <a href=\"#H3401004213\" class=\"local\">'Recommended during pregnancy'</a> above).

Lupus nephritis flares during pregnancy can mimic preeclampsia, presenting with increasing proteinuria, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and a deterioration in renal function. Active lupus nephritis and preeclampsia can also occur at the same time. Evidence of lupus activity in other organs can sometimes help distinguish SLE from preeclampsia.</p><p>Laboratory testing may be, but is not always, useful in distinguishing preeclampsia from nephritis or a lupus flare:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus nephritis is often associated with proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an active urine sediment (red and white cells and cellular casts), whereas only proteinuria is seen in preeclampsia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flares of SLE are likely to be associated with low or decreasing complement levels and increased titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies; by comparison, complement levels are usually, but not always, normal or increased in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia, elevated serum levels of liver enzymes and an elevated or rising level of uric acid are more prominent in preeclampsia than lupus nephritis. However, thrombocytopenia may also be seen in association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and immune thrombocytopenia, each of which may complicate pregnancy in women with SLE.</p><p/><p>The onset of these overlapping symptoms before 20 weeks of gestation is more consistent with lupus nephritis. Renal biopsy could help differentiate the two conditions, but the higher risk of complications during pregnancy limits the use in pregnancy.

Treatment should not be withheld due to pregnancy; however, some medications used to treat SLE may cross the placenta and cause fetal harm. Thus, the risks and benefits of treatment during pregnancy must be weighed against the risk of SLE activity having a deleterious effect on the mother and the fetus.
