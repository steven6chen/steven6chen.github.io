However, newer studies suggest that the prevalence is considerably higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In a retrospective, multicenter review, more widespread use of the plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (plasma aldosterone <span class=\"nowrap\">concentration/plasma</span> renin activity <span class=\"nowrap\">[PAC/PRA]</span> ratio) as a case-detection test in hypertensive patients resulted in marked increases (1.3- to 6.3-fold) in the annual detection rate of primary aldosteronism and in the proportion of hypertensive patients in whom primary aldosteronism was detected (1 to 2 percent before screening to 5 to 10 percent after screening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of primary mineralocorticoid excess (with aldosterone, and to a much lesser degree, deoxycorticosterone, being the major endogenous mineralocorticoids) should be suspected in any patient with the triad of hypertension, unexplained hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, there are patients with primary mineralocorticoid excess who are normokalemic and rarely some who are hypokalemic but normotensive.</p><p>It is now estimated that only 9 to 37 percent of patients with primary aldosteronism are hypokalemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. This is likely related to earlier diagnosis as more patients with hypertension are being screened with the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio as a case-detection test for primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism#H3163872797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia: An inconsistent finding'</a>.)</p><p>A few patients with primary aldosteronism have hypokalemia but a normal systemic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Surreptitious vomiting, diuretic therapy, and Bartter syndrome should be excluded; each of these disorders is associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism as the PRA and plasma renin concentration (PRC) are increased rather than suppressed, as in primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Plasma renin activity/plasma renin concentration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1568453074\" class=\"local\">'Secondary hyperaldosteronism'</a> below.)</p><p>Normokalemia is the rule in patients with the rare genetic disorder glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA). There are, however, important physiologic differences between GRA and other forms of hyperaldosteronism that could account for the lesser likelihood of potassium wasting.

Less common causes include Cushing's syndrome, licorice ingestion, certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Liddle's syndrome, and rare renin-secreting tumors.</p><p>Cushing's syndrome may lead to hypokalemia, due in part to the overproduction of corticotropin (ACTH)-dependent compounds such as deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and cortisol. However, the hypertension in this disorder is usually not related to mineralocorticoid excess or sodium retention and is usually suspected from the classic Cushingoid appearance, including central obesity, purple abdominal striae, proximal muscle weakness, and hirsutism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The degree of ACTH and cortisol hypersecretion, and therefore the frequency of hypokalemia, is much higher in the ectopic ACTH syndrome than with a pituitary adenoma (50 versus 9 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) appears to be the diagnostic procedure of choice since false negative results occur with arteriography or renal vein renin sampling. Surgical removal of the tumor cures the disease.</p><p>Liddle's syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition in which there is a primary increase in sodium reabsorption in the collecting tubules and, in most cases, potassium secretion. The underlying defect is a gain-of-function mutation in the collecting tubule sodium channel.

Case-detection testing with a <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio has historically been recommended in hypertensive patients with one or more of the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/4,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia, including patients treated with low-dose thiazide diuretics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or resistant hypertension, which is suggestive of some form of secondary hypertension; the likelihood of detecting primary aldosteronism is highest in patients with resistant hypertension (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adrenal incidentaloma</p><p/><p>However, many more hypertensive patients are now tested using the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio. (See <a href=\"#H2090724661\" class=\"local\">'Case detection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2697328494\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying primary aldosteronism is important because of its prevalence and association with a higher rate of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality when compared with age- and sex-matched patients with primary hypertension and the same degree of blood pressure elevation. In patients diagnosed with primary aldosteronism, treatment of the mineralocorticoid excess results in reversal or improvement of the hypertension and resolution of the increased cardiovascular risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Case-detection testing</strong> &ndash; Testing should be performed in patient groups with a relatively high prevalence of primary aldosteronism (see <a href=\"#H86977380\" class=\"local\">'Who should be tested?'</a> below). Measurements of the plasma renin activity (PRA) (<strong>or</strong> plasma renin concentration [PRC]) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) are obtained in the morning in a seated ambulatory patient. (See <a href=\"#H2090724661\" class=\"local\">'Case detection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initial evaluation should consist of documenting that the PRA or PRC is suppressed (typically undetectable) and that the PAC is inappropriately high for the PRA (typically &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [416 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L]);</span> the net effect is a <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio greater than 20 (depending upon the laboratory normals) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F111376\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111376 \">algorithm 1</a>). An elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio and an increased PAC are <strong>both</strong> required for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Protocol'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Case confirmation</strong> &ndash; In most patients, an elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio alone does not establish the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, which must be confirmed by demonstrating inappropriate aldosterone secretion with one of several tests. The exception to the requirement for confirmatory testing is the patient with spontaneous hypokalemia, undetectable PRA or PRC, and a PAC &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL;</span> in this clinical setting, there is no other diagnosis except primary aldosteronism to explain these findings. However, aldosterone suppression testing is usually needed, and it can be performed with orally administered sodium chloride and measurement of urine aldosterone excretion or with intravenous sodium chloride loading and measurement of PAC. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of the diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subtype classification</strong> &ndash; Once the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism has been established, a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), or rarely, carcinoma, must be distinguished from bilateral hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism [IHA]). This is important since the treatment options are different for the two disorders. We suggest the algorithm developed at the Mayo Clinic that uses adrenal computed tomography (CT) and adrenal vein sampling (AVS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76673\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76673 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Subtype classification'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2090724661\"><span class=\"h1\">CASE DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case-detection testing (with a plasma aldosterone to renin <span class=\"nowrap\">[PAC/PRA]</span> ratio) should be performed in patient groups with a relatively high prevalence of primary aldosteronism. As noted, the prevalence of primary aldosteronism in patients with hypertension is considerably higher than previously thought (see <a href=\"#H2048415590\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of primary aldosteronism'</a> above). In addition, more widespread testing has demonstrated that normokalemic, rather than hypokalemic, hypertension is the most common presentation of primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/1,3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Variable presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>In 2016, the Endocrine Society updated their 2008 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They continue to recommend case-detection testing (with a <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio) in patient groups with a relatively high prevalence of primary aldosteronism (hypertension with hypokalemia, adrenal&nbsp;incidentaloma, or family history early-onset hypertension) (see <a href=\"#H86977380\" class=\"local\">'Who should be tested?'</a> below). However, there are broadened indications for screening to include patients with sustained blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg (systolic) and &gt;100 mmHg (diastolic) (versus <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;160/100</span> in the previous guidelines) and patients with hypertension and sleep apnea. In addition, they emphasize the need for more timely diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism, given its prevalence (10 percent in hypertensives) and its association with cardiovascular and renal damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism#H3485804445\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular risk'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach outlined below is consistent with the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines.

On the other hand, increased PRA or PRC in a hypokalemic hypertensive patient is most often due to diuretic therapy, renovascular or malignant hypertension, or rarely a renin-secreting tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F111376\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111376 \">algorithm 1</a>).

The definition of an abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio is laboratory dependent. In general, PRA and PRC are undetectable in patients with primary aldosteronism. Also, in most patients with primary aldosteronism, the PAC is &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (416 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L);</span> the net effect is a <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio greater than 20 (depending upon the laboratory normals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although we consider a <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio &gt;20 to be suggestive of primary aldosteronism, others use a cutoff criteria of 30 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87570 \">table 1</a>). Cutoff values also depend upon whether hormone concentrations are expressed in conventional or SI units (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87570 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The mean value for the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio in normal subjects and patients with primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) is 4 to 10, compared with more than 30 to 50 in most patients with primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. PRA and PRC are low in a significant number of patients with primary hypertension, but a high PAC (typically &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [416 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L])</span> and a truly abnormal ratio are uncommon.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio is <strong>denominator</strong> dependent. The lower limit of detection varies among the different PRA assays and can have a dramatic effect on the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, a very different ratio is obtained if the lower limit of detection for PRA is 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> per hour compared with 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> per hour; for a PAC of 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (444 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio would be 27 and 160, respectively. Thus, the cutoff for a &quot;high&quot; <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio is laboratory dependent and, more specifically, PRA assay dependent. It is for this reason that an increased PAC is part of the diagnostic requirement. Note that the conventional units for aldosterone are <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;ng/dL&quot;</span> and SI units are <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;pmol/L</span>.&quot; To convert <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> to SI units, multiply by 27.74 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F87570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87570 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The efficacy of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAC/PRA</span> ratio was illustrated in a study in which blood was drawn at 8 AM after two hours of ambulation in 62 patients with primary aldosteronism (48 adrenal adenoma, 14 adrenal hyperplasia), in 263 with presumed primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension), and in 434 normotensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
