The dissemination of clinical practice guidelines that list theophylline as a &quot;not preferred&quot; alternative, the availability of newer agents, and concerns regarding the risk-benefit ratio of the drug have resulted in infrequent prescribing of theophylline. Nevertheless, its low cost offers an advantage over other long-term maintenance medications that are added to inhaled glucocorticoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> and long-acting beta agonists.</p><p>The indications for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> in the treatment of asthma and recommendations for its safe use will be discussed here. Overviews of the treatment of acute and chronic asthma are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic actions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though traditionally classified as a bronchodilator, the ability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> to control chronic asthma appears disproportionately greater than is explainable by its modest degree of bronchodilator activity alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Theophylline has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and bronchoprotective effects that potentially contribute to its efficacy as a prophylactic anti-asthma drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>] and for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Activation of histone deacetylase-2 leads to switching off of activated inflammatory genes, which in turn may contribute to reversal of glucocorticoid resistance by theophylline.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Theophylline</a> down-regulates inflammatory and immune cell function in vitro and in vivo in animals with airway inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In patients with allergic asthma, it attenuates the late phase increase in airway obstruction and airway responsiveness to histamine, decreases allergen-induced migration of activated eosinophils into the bronchial mucosa, and decreases the sputum eosinophil count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/8,9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,18</a>]. Moreover, withdrawal of theophylline from patients with severe chronic asthma receiving high-doses of inhaled glucocorticoid therapy results in increased symptoms of asthma accompanied by an increase in the number of activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in the bronchial mucosa and an increase in helper T-lymphocytes in the airway epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The reduction in nocturnal worsening of lung function when theophylline is used is associated with both a decrease in the percentage of neutrophils and a decrease in stimulated leukotriene B4 from macrophages in early morning bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An in depth review of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and glucocorticoid-sparing effects of theophylline has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Although several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the actions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, the non-specific inhibition of phosphodiesterase that occurs at clinically relevant drug concentrations appears to be the most important. Theophylline increases the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides in airway smooth muscle and inflammatory cells by inhibiting phosphodiesterase-mediated hydrolysis. However, inhibition of specific isozymes may also be important; inhibition of phosphodiesterase type III and type IV relaxes smooth muscles in pulmonary arteries and in airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], while anti-inflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunomodulatory actions probably result from inhibition of the type IV isozymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This information has stimulated interest in investigating more specific inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type IV for asthma therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Theophylline also increases histone deacetylase-2 activity, which may increase glucocorticoid responsiveness in patients with glucocorticoid-resistant severe asthma and in patients with asthma who are cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four clinical circumstances for which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> may be considered in the treatment of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additive maintenance therapy in a patient whose asthma is not adequately controlled with conventional doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, or when addition of a long acting beta agonist either provides no benefit or actually causes worsening of control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary maintenance therapy in a patient who is more likely to adhere to an oral than an inhaled regimen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> is not sufficiently effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary maintenance therapy when the administration of an inhaled glucocorticoid is difficult or cumbersome (eg, toddlers and preschool-age children) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> is not effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additive acute therapy in the intensive care unit for patients failing to respond to vigorous use of inhaled beta2-selective agonists in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous magnesium and systemically administered glucocorticoids, although evidence for benefit in this situation is lacking.

The doses of theophylline administered were 250 mg or 375 mg, twice daily, for patients weighing &lt;80 kg or &ge;80 kg, respectively. The median serum concentration was 8.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> below the commonly-employed therapeutic range (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span>. Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater forced expiratory flow in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC), while there were no differences between the groups in terms of beta-agonist use or peak expiratory flow variability. Adverse events were similar in both treatment groups. The high dose budesonide group exhibited suppressed morning serum cortisol levels at the conclusion of the three month study period, but the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. The authors of this report also estimated that the monthly cost of the combination of low dose budesonide and theophylline was markedly lower than the cost of high dose budesonide or budesonide combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>.

Compared with placebo, treatment with theophylline produced more symptom-free days (63 versus 42 percent) as well as significant improvements in spirometry and airway responsiveness to exercise.

Theophylline withdrawal was associated with a significant increase in asthma symptoms, particularly at night, and a fall in spirometry and morning peak flow. Withdrawal also resulted in an increase in the number of activated T-lymphocytes in the airway mucosa among the subset of patients who underwent transbronchial biopsy, suggesting that theophylline may have immunomodulatory properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74336 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p>The ability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> to help control chronic asthma in these and other studies has been disproportionate to its relatively mild bronchodilator activity. For this reason, additional mechanisms of theophylline activity have been postulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/7-9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,20</a>] and decreases in airway reactivity to histamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, and exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. The former probably result from inhibition of type IV phosphodiesterase isozymes within inflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Compared to other additive therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few studies directly comparing the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> to the addition of other controller therapies (anti-leukotriene agents, long-acting beta-agonists [LABAs]) in patients receiving inhaled GC therapy. Anti-leukotriene agents and theophylline have the &quot;real-world&quot; advantage of being orally administered rather than inhaled. Many patients find an oral agent simpler to administer than an additional metered dose inhaler, and compliance is greater, on average, with an oral medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>However, only inhaled LABAs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, have been demonstrated to be superior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> in head-to-head studies, although the difference is small, and there are concerns about the safety of LABAs in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/26,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34,35</a>].

The number of symptom-free nights was significantly greater in the salmeterol group (71 versus 46 percent) although there were no significant differences in daytime symptoms or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).

Furthermore, this result would not be predicted by the relatively greater magnitude of clinical benefit reported from theophylline, when the two agents were studied separately as add-on therapy with inhaled GC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/5,7,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,37</a>]. In a subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 489 adults, neither the addition of low-dose theophylline nor montelukast lowered the event rate in patients with poor asthma control taking inhaled GC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In contrast, in patients not taking inhaled GC, theophylline improved asthma symptoms significantly more than montelukast or placebo. Transient gastrointestinal side effects were more frequent with theophylline. The dose of theophylline in this study was only 300 mg of a 12-hour slow-release formulation daily.

As a result, dosing must be individually titrated to appropriate steady-state serum concentrations in order to achieve maximal benefit and safety. This requires skill and knowledge on the part of the clinician and an ability of patients or parents to follow instructions properly. Failure to adequately monitor theophylline use can lead to potentially fatal drug intoxication.

As an example, one epidemiologic investigation of 36,000 ambulatory patients who received 225,000 prescriptions for theophylline over a nine year period found that the risk of hospital admission due to complications of chronic theophylline use was less than 1 per 1000 patient-years of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Factors that must be considered to maximize the safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> include proper target serum concentration, appropriate dosage titration, the presence of conditions or factors that affect theophylline metabolism, and proper product and dosing interval selection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Target serum concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy and toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> are closely related to the PEAK serum concentration.

Such a distinction is important because fluctuations in serum concentration can be sufficient for a trough concentration in the 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> range to result in a peak above 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and consequent toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/theophylline-use-in-asthma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiating and titrating oral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When beginning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> for maintenance therapy, the initial dose should be sufficiently low to avoid transient caffeine-like side effects such as insomnia and irritability. In non-smoking adults without risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance, a starting daily dose of 300 mg is appropriate in most cases. A sustained release product should be used from the beginning.
