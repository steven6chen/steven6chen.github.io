A review of 40 studies found that over 75 percent of patients who died by suicide had contact with primary care providers within the year of their death, compared with one-third who had contact with mental health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly, twice as many decedents had contact with primary care providers as mental health services in the month before their suicide (45 versus 20 percent).</p><p>Despite this, there are no data to show that screening for suicide in primary care reduces mortality. Additionally, predicting which patients with suicidal thoughts will go on to attempt suicide cannot be achieved with a high degree of sensitivity or specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the fact that primary care clinicians see a large portion of the patients who subsequently die by suicide suggests that an approach to case finding based upon risk factors, sensitivity to high-risk situations in depressed patients, and assessment of suicidality in patients being treated for depression are appropriate in the primary care setting, and may uncover occasional patients who make their intent known and are amenable to intervention.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, evaluation, initial management, and follow-up of the suicidal patient.

Reported rates of suicide, however, may underestimate the true burden because of misclassification of death due to legal or social stigma and procedural issues related to death registration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In 2013, 842,000 people in the world died from intentional self-harm; China and India accounted for approximately 50 percent of all suicides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among 240 causes of death, self-harm was the 14<sup>th</sup> leading cause of years of life lost in the world.

Age-adjusted suicide rates for adults aged 35 to 64 years increased approximately 28 percent (from 14 to 18 per 100,000) from 1999 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, rates for persons aged 10 to 34 years rose 7 percent and rates for adults &ge;65 years of age decreased 6 percent.</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of all suicides completed in the United States are accomplished with firearms (57 percent of suicides in males) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The second leading method of suicide in the United States is hanging for men and poisoning for women.

A study of a community sample used medical records from 1986 to 2007 to identify 1490 individuals with a first lifetime suicide attempt reaching medical attention; more than 5 percent (n = 81) perished by suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of the 81, more than half (n = 48, 59 percent) died on the index suicide attempt, and among the 33 individuals who survived the index attempt, 27 (82 percent) killed themselves within one year. &#160; &#160;</p><p>One of every 100 suicide attempt survivors will die by suicide within one year of their index attempt, a risk approximately 100 times that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Following a suicide attempt, the risk for completed suicide is greatest in patients with schizophrenia, unipolar major depression, and bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that there are 10 to 40 nonfatal suicide attempts for every completed suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/2,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychiatric illness is a strong predictor of suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. More than 90 percent of patients who attempt suicide have a psychiatric disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and 95 percent of patients who successfully commit suicide have a psychiatric diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Severity of psychiatric illness is associated with risk of suicide. As an example, a meta-analysis found that the lifetime risk of suicide is 8.6 percent in patients who have had a psychiatric inpatient admission involving suicidal ideation, 4 percent in patients who have had a psychiatric admission for an affective disorder without suicidality, 2.2 percent in psychiatric outpatients, and less than 0.5 percent in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who have multiple psychiatric comorbidities appear to be at higher risk than those with uncomplicated depression or an anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Suicide may be concentrated in the days and weeks following psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. In one systematic review, 41 percent of those who committed suicide had been psychiatric inpatients within the previous year and as many as 9 percent of suicides occurred within one day of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This last figure may have been inflated by including some patients who committed suicide during their inpatient stays.</p><p>The psychiatric disorders most commonly associated with suicide include depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or other substance abuse, schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], personality disorders, anxiety disorders including panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, and delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among patients with depression, a history of suicide attempts correlated most strongly with feelings of worthlessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Concurrent personality disorder was also strongly correlated with suicide attempts in depressed patients. </p><p>Anxiety disorders more than double the risk of suicide attempts (odds ratio 2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and a combination of depression and anxiety greatly increases the risk (odds ratio 17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Symptoms of psychosis (delusions, command auditory hallucinations, paranoia) may increase the risk regardless of diagnosis.</p><p>The reported rate of suicide among alcoholics has ranged from 2 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Almost 90 percent of alcoholic suicides are committed by men. Of people who commit suicide, approximately 20 to 25 percent are intoxicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a Center for Disease Control and Prevention study from 13 states, alcohol was detected in 33.3 percent of suicide victims tested for substance abuse in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

As an example, in one multivariate model, hopelessness was 1.3 times more important than depression in explaining suicidal ideation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Hopelessness can persist even when other symptoms of depression have remitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Hopelessness may mediate the relationship between low self-esteem, loneliness, interpersonal losses, and suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Impulsivity, particularly among adolescents and young adults, is also associated with acting on suicidal thoughts, and the combination of hopelessness, impulsivity, and disinhibition from substance abuse may be particularly lethal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Age, sex, and race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of suicide increases with increasing age, however young adults attempt suicide more often than older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Females attempt suicide nearly twice as often as males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], but males complete suicide three times more often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These age and sex differences appear to be primarily related to the lethality of the method chosen (eg, firearms, hanging, or falls) rather than a difference in completion rates for the same method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Elderly white men, aged 85 years and older, have the highest suicide rate (51.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/year</span> per 100,000 population) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although suicide rates have been higher among whites than blacks (12 compared with 5 per 100,000 in 2003) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], the rate differences between races have been narrowing in recent years, with increasing rates of suicide attempts especially among young black males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Marital status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suicide risk varies with marital status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The highest risk occurs among those never married, followed in descending order of risk by widowed, separated, or divorced; married without children; and married with children. Whatever the family structure, living alone increases the risk of suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Occupation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suicide may be greater in patients who serve in unskilled occupations than skilled occupations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A meta-analysis of 34 studies (sample size not specified) found that the risk of suicide was greater among the least skilled workers (eg, laborers and office cleaners who perform simple manual tasks) than in the general working-age population (rate ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. By contrast, the risk of suicide was lower in the most skilled workers (eg, general managers who solve complex problems) than in the general working-age population (rate ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9). In addition, unemployment and economic strain may lead to a higher risk of suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>However, among highly skilled workers, physicians may be at increased risk of suicide. A meta-analysis of 25 studies (approximately 2100 suicides among physicians) found that the rate of suicide was greater in female physicians than the general population (standardized mortality ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.7), and was also greater in male physicians than the general population (standardized mortality ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89623530\"><span class=\"h2\">Military service</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the rate of suicide in military veterans exceeds that of the general population.

The risk may be even greater in patients with multiple pain conditions, severe pain, and more frequent episodes of intermittent pain (eg, migraines), as well as those who are unemployed or disabled due to their pain condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse childhood experiences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childhood abuse and other adverse childhood experiences (eg, intimate partner abuse or substance abuse in the home, mentally ill household member, parents separated or divorced, an incarcerated family member) appear to increase the risk of suicide in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of seven prospective observational studies (n &gt;6500 subjects) found that suicide attempts were more than twice as likely to occur in adults who suffered childhood sexual abuse, compared with adults who were not abused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

As an example, a national registry study found that if one sibling died by suicide, the risk of remaining siblings doing so was increased both among women (odds ratio 3) and men (odds ratio 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Twin studies suggest that the increased risk of suicide among patients with a family history of suicide has both environmental and genetic components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/59,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62</a>]. The heritability of suicide is in the range of 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, it is not clear whether the genetic component is primarily responsible for the underlying psychiatric disorder or for the suicide itself. In one study, both a family history of completed suicide and psychiatric illness were risk factors for suicide, and the effect of family suicide history was independent of the family history of psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Additionally, having an unrelated spouse who has a psychiatric disorder or who commits suicide increases the risk of suicide, showing the importance of environmental effects within the family structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H312148990\"><span class=\"h2\">Firearms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 14 observational studies found that the risk of completed suicide was three times greater among individuals with access to firearms, compared to individuals without available firearms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who agree to adhere to a safety plan may still be at high risk; this agreement does not protect patients or clinicians, and is not a substitute for thorough evaluation, sound clinical judgment, and meaningful therapeutic interaction, particularly with impulsive patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying factors and mental disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once immediate safety has been ensured, clinicians should address underlying factors, including precipitating events, ongoing life difficulties, and mental disorders.</p><p>Precipitating events include the death of a loved one, loss of a job, breakup of a marriage, school or social failure, sexual identity crisis, or trauma. In addition, people may attempt suicide as an alternative to intolerable life circumstances, such as abusive relationships, occupational stresses, and chronic isolation (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above).

As an example, a retrospective registry study found that a doubling of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescriptions was associated with a 25 percent reduction in suicides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Nevertheless, the data supporting the use of antidepressants appear to be less compelling than the evidence for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>. A meta-analysis of three small randomized trials compared antidepressants (mianserin, nomifensine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>) with placebo in 243 patients who were hospitalized after suicide attempts; duration of treatment ranged from 12 weeks to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Repetition of self-harm was comparable for the two groups. The issue of antidepressants and warnings about increased suicidal ideation and behavior is discussed separately.

In addition, the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> may be dangerous in overdose and should probably be avoided. By contrast, the SSRIs appear to be safer when taken in overdose and should be the drugs of choice in potentially suicidal depressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

Patients with suicidal ideation who are at risk of overdosing on any medication may need to be hospitalized. </p><p>Pharmacotherapy for underlying psychiatric disorders in suicidal patients is often nonexistent or inadequate (eg, doses below the therapeutic minimum). Psychologic autopsy studies have found that among all patients who commit suicide, only 8 to 17 percent received any psychiatric medications; among depressed suicide victims, only 6 to 14 percent were adequately treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2378343048\"><span class=\"h4\">Investigational approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketamine</a> is a standard anesthetic drug that has been studied as a possible treatment for acute suicidal ideation in the emergency room setting.

A four-week randomized trial compared adjunctive, low dose buprenorphine (mean dose 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with placebo in patients (n = 62) with severe suicidal ideation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Patients carried various diagnoses, such as borderline personality disorder, unipolar major depression, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adjustment disorder, and were treated with a variety of medications (eg, antidepressants <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> benzodiazepines). Improvement of suicidal ideation was greater with buprenorphine and was independent of treatment with antidepressants. Adverse effects were also more common with buprenorphine than placebo, including fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, and constipation; however, discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was comparable for the two groups. The study medication was abruptly stopped after four weeks; at the follow-up appointment one week later, all of the patients denied withdrawal symptoms and no exacerbation of suicidal ideation was reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91195802\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a suicide attempt, psychotherapy may prevent subsequent attempts. As an example, a national registry study identified patients who attempted suicide and subsequently received either psychotherapy (n &gt;5000) or standard care (n &gt;17,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Propensity scoring was used to match the two groups with regard to 31 potential confounders (eg, sex, psychiatric diagnoses, and prior deliberate self-harm). Psychotherapy consisted of 8 to 10 individual sessions focused upon suicide prevention, but was otherwise not standardized; different approaches were used, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), problem solving therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, or psychodynamic psychotherapy. During 20 years of follow-up, suicide deaths occurred in fewer patients who received psychotherapy than standard care (1.6 versus 2.2 percent). All-cause mortality was also lower in patients who received psychotherapy than standard care (6.9 versus 9.6 percent).</p><p>Among psychotherapies, we prefer CBT or problem solving therapy, based upon randomized trials. As an example, a meta-analysis of 10 trials compared CBT or problem solving therapy with usual care in patients (n &gt;2200) with an episode of self-harm, who were followed for up to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Self-harm included any nonfatal act of self-injury, regardless of suicidal intent. Repetition of self-harm was less likely to occur with <span class=\"nowrap\">CBT/problem</span> solving therapy than usual care (odds ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.65-0.98). In addition, improvement of depression, including hopelessness and suicidal ideation, was greater with active treatment. &#160; </p><p>Self-harm includes both nonsuicidal self-injury and suicide attempts, which differ in multiple ways, including frequency; nonsuicidal self-injury may occur daily, whereas suicide attempts occur less frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Randomized trials indicate that CBT can specifically reduce suicide attempts. As an example, a randomized trial compared usual care plus CBT (10 weekly sessions) with usual care alone in 120 patients who were evaluated in an emergency department following a suicide attempt; patients were followed for up to 18 months following the baseline interview. Suicide attempts during follow-up occurred in fewer patients treated with CBT plus usual care than usual care alone (24 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p>If CBT or problem solving therapy are not available, it is reasonable to use other types of other psychotherapies. As an example, a meta-analysis of three randomized trials compared dialectical behavior therapy with usual care in patients (n = 292) with an episode of self-harm, and found that the frequency of self-harm decreased more with dialectical behavior therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1003549102\"><span class=\"h3\">Electroconvulsive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For severely depressed suicidal patients, electroconvulsive therapy frequently provides a rapid response that may be lifesaving in the short term, and perhaps in the long term as well.

As an example, a prospective observational study compared the benefit of usual care alone (n = 497); universal screening for suicidal ideation or behavior plus usual care (n = 377); and universal screening, usual care, plus an adjunctive intervention (n = 502) in patients who presented to an emergency department and confirmed the presence of active suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt in the past week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The intervention included formulating a self-administered safety plan during the emergency department visit, and seven subsequent telephone calls (each lasting 10 to 20 minutes) focused upon coping with risk factors, personal goals, safety planning, and treatment adherence. Patients were followed for up to one year, during which the risk of suicide attempts was less in patients who received the adjunctive intervention, compared with usual care alone (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97). By contrast, the number of suicide attempts was similar for universal screening plus usual care compared with usual care alone. Other interventions with demonstrated success for postcrisis suicide prevention include periodically sending letters to patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring and follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at risk of suicide should be followed regularly as warranted by the level of risk, bearing in mind that risk fluctuates, particularly if the patient's situation changes. As part of monitoring previously suicidal patients, the clinician should determine if there have been changes, especially a reemergence of precipitating events, adverse life circumstances, or mental disorders. Following acute management of suicidality, the primary care clinician should assure that patients are actively engaged in ongoing care for any mental disorders and that they receive maintenance treatment to prevent or forestall recurrent episodes of unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, and substance use disorders. </p><p>The risk of suicide is increased in the days and initial weeks following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization, particularly if patients perceive that they have lost a therapeutic support system, including contact with a mental health professional. The risk is particularly high in the first week after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>], and more than one-third of all suicides in the first year following hospital discharge occur in the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. </p><p>Scheduling the first follow-up visit soon after a psychiatric hospitalization may reduce suicide rates. An observational study found that implementing a policy to follow-up patients within seven days of discharge was associated with a decreased rate of suicide during the three months after discharge (from 2.5 to 2.0 suicides per 10,000 discharged patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. </p><p>Patients are also at high risk for nonadherence to pharmacotherapy soon after discharge, and thus have a consequent increased risk of suicide. By contrast, those who continue care in the community and who maintain pharmacotherapy are at lower risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. In addition, an observational study found that assertive community outreach to patients who are nonadherent with medications or appointments was associated with decreased suicide rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Nonadherence may be due to adverse effects, lack of symptom relief, not understanding the purpose of medications, or failure to appreciate the consequences. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTSUICIDE INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postsuicide interventions are intended to help family, friends, or coworkers understand why suicide victims killed themselves, and decrease the assumption of inappropriate guilt for the death. The intervention is often designed to identify those at risk of suicide, as well as prevent posttraumatic stress disorder, complicated grief, and depressive syndromes. &#160;</p><p>However, there is little evidence that postsuicide interventions are beneficial. As an example, a randomized trial compared psychoeducation (four sessions, each lasting two hours, administered during home visits) with no intervention in 83 individuals bereaved through suicide; improvement of depressive symptoms (including suicidal ideation) and complicated grief symptoms in the two groups was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].
