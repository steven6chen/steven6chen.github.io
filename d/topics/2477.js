Eight weeks of therapy with nifedipine alone or in combination with isosorbide dinitrate resulted in a significantly higher incidence of hospitalization (24 and 26 versus 0 percent with isosorbide dinitrate alone), episodes of worsening HF (9 and 21 versus 5), and premature discontinuation of therapy due to clinical deterioration or other side effects (29 and 19 versus 5 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Verapamil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> does not appear to be effective in patients with heart failure (HF) after an acute myocardial infarction, although it does not increase mortality.

After a mean follow-up of 25 months, patients with pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray who were treated with diltiazem had a significant increase in cardiac mortality or recurrent nonfatal infarction compared to placebo (hazard ratio 1.41). In contrast, diltiazem reduced the incidence of cardiac mortality and risk of recurrent nonfatal infarction in patients without pulmonary congestion (hazard ratio 0.77).</p><p>A subsequent analysis found a similar effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> when analyzed by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among 623 patients with an LVEF &le;0.40, the incidence of late HF episodes was higher in those taking diltiazem (21 versus 12 percent for placebo). The incidence of late HF increased progressively with decrements in baseline LVEF. In comparison, diltiazem had no adverse effect in patients with an LVEF above 40 percent.</p><p>An increase in recurrent infarction in diltiazem-treated patients with left ventricular dysfunction was also suggested in a retrospective analysis of almost 7000 patients entered into the SOLVD trials, most of whom had a remote infarction and one-third of whom were taking a short-acting calcium channel blocker, primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, such a deleterious effect of calcium channel blocker therapy was not seen in a retrospective analysis from the SAVE trial of 2231 patients who had asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after an acute infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">DiDi trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diltiazem</a> in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DiDi) trial randomly assigned 186 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III HF to diltiazem (60 or 90 mg TID) or placebo, added to standard therapy; however, only 153 patients completed the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A possible explanation is the different patient characteristics. The etiology for the HF differed and patients in DiDi may have had less severe HF than those in MDPIT; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at entry was 34 percent, the baseline mean PA pressure was 20 mmHg, and mean cardiac index was 3.0. It is possible that patients with more severe disease, as in MDPIT, would have had adverse effects related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4220532143\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND GENERATION AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second-generation calcium channel blockers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a> have little or no negative inotropic activity at the usual therapeutic doses, and may be better tolerated than the other calcium channel blockers in patients with heart failure (HF).
