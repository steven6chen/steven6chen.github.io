Cysts may be due to nonhereditary fetal malformations or genetic disorders, or, rarely, they may be acquired. Cysts may also occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome.</p><p>An overview of the different forms of pediatric renal cystic disease will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NONHEREDITARY RENAL MALFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystic renal dysplasia, defined by microscopic features, is due to renal parenchymal malformation of the fetal kidney. As a result, the kidney contains primitive ducts and cysts, and nonrenal tissues such as cartilage, fat, and hematopoietic tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;, section on 'Renal parenchymal malformations'</a>.)</p><p>Although the nonheritable mechanisms responsible for this disorder remain unclear, an alteration in renal mitogen expression may, in part, underlie the abnormalities in renal parenchymal differentiation. One study of multicystic renal dysplasia, for example, found significant temporal and spatial alterations in insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor binding protein expression during early fetal life and the postnatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathogenetic significance of these changes is uncertain.</p><p>Cystic dysplasia is also often associated with antenatal obstruction of the urinary tract, which may be associated with posterior urethral valves (PUV) or ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. Cystic dysplasia is frequently observed in the atrophic pole of a kidney with duplicated ureters or an ectopic ureterocele.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Multicystic dysplastic kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most severe form of cystic renal dysplasia is the multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), which is commonly detected by antenatal ultrasonography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79332\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79332 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80361\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80361 \">image 2</a>). The MCDK consists of numerous noncommunicating cysts separated by dysplastic tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66837 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59147 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68485\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68485 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73581\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73581 \">image 4</a>). There is typically no identifiable renal tissue, although in some cases some minimal functional renal tissue may exist in the dysplastic area. The ureter is absent or atretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The cause of MCDK is unclear. There may be an underlying genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This was illustrated by a study that analyzed coding exons of genes associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in a large cohort of children with CAKUT that reported MCDK was associated with mutations in the <em>CHD 1L, ROBO2, HNF 1B, </em>and <em>SALL1</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The incidence of MCDK varies according to the country and the study, ranging from 1 per 3600 to 1 per 4300 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. MCDK may involve both kidneys, but most cases are unilateral, with the left kidney being more often affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. MCDK occurs more frequently in boys than in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the majority of cases, involution of the MCDK occurs as demonstrated by repeat ultrasound exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The rate of involution is generally greatest during the first two to three years of life and completed at a median age of 5.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>If the contralateral kidney is normal, it usually undergoes compensatory hypertrophy, which begins in utero and is typically observed by three years of age, resulting in a kidney size that is greater than two standard deviations beyond the mean length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The absence of compensatory hypertrophy suggests abnormalities of the contralateral kidney. The contralateral urinary tract may be associated with a variety of other defects, including rotational or positional anomalies, hypoplasia, areas of dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), ureterocele, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, or genital abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/2,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15-17</a>]. VUR is the most common renal abnormality, occurring in up to 25 percent of contralateral kidneys of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]. Extrarenal malformations also may be seen (eg, heart defects, esophageal or intestinal atresia, or myelomeningocele).</p><p>In the neonate, the MCDK can be detected as a palpable flank mass. It is usually easily distinguished from hydronephrosis by ultrasonography, which reveals large, peripheral cysts without recognizable renal parenchyma. Complications are very uncommon; thus, the diagnosis is not made in many cases unless there is a palpable mass or a radiologic procedure of the kidney is performed for some other reason.</p><p>Hypertension and neoplasia have been reported in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. However, a systematic review of 29 studies found six cases of hypertension in the entire pool of 1115 patients, an incidence that is lower than that found in the general pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In case reports of patients with MCDK and hypertension, nephrectomy resulted in resolution of hypertension in only 25 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These data suggest that MCDK is not a significant etiology for pediatric hypertension. For patients with MCD, the rate of malignant transformation of MCDK is small, if at all increased, in comparison with those in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases of MCDK, the natural history without intervention is involution of the affected kidney, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2008 review of the literature, analysis of 105 reports of MCDK demonstrated involution or regression of 60 percent of MCDK kidneys within the first three years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of patients will have VUR in the contralateral kidney, of which 90 percent is grade III or below. There appears to be no clinically significant increased risk of hypertension compared with the general population. In this review, the risk of developing a Wilms tumor in a MCDK was less than 1 in 2000 cases and patients with Wilms tumor were diagnosed before four years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study from a regional registry of 323 patients with MCDK from 1985 to 2009, 10 percent of antenatally detected MCDK had involuted by the time of the first postnatal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Long-term follow-up (mean 10.1 years) demonstrated complete involution of 35, 47, and 62 percent of MCDK kidneys at 2-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up, respectively. Involution was more likely to occur in patients with a MCDK that was initially less than 5 cm in length. Contralateral abnormalities were observed in 14 percent of patients, including VUR (11 percent) and UPJ obstruction (3 percent). At 10-year follow-up, 6 of 94 patients had blood pressure that exceed the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile, of whom four were noted to have &quot;white coat&quot; hypertension with normal 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements. There was no reported malignancy during the follow-up period. The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 76 patients (7 and 69 patients at 5- and 10-year follow-up, respectively) was 93 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (range 47 to 181). Thirty-three patients (43 percent) had mild renal impairment with an estimated GFR between 60 and 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Thirty-one of these 33 patients (94 percent) had compensatory hypertrophy. As a result, ongoing follow-up of renal function is needed even in patients with compensatory hypertrophy. In a retrospective study of 80 patients from a single center, involution or disappearance of the affected kidney occurred in 72 patients (90 percent) and renal hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney in 60 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At a mean follow-up of five years, no patient had developed hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, or malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another retrospective review of 105 patients from a single center, complete involution of the affected kidney occurred in 60 percent of the group within five years, and compensatory hypertrophy was noted in 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Contralateral abnormalities included VUR (17 percent), UPJ obstruction (4 percent), and megaureter (2 percent). At a mean follow-up of 5.9 years, 8 of 82 patients had a reduced estimated GFR of less than 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95167046\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because most cases of MCDK naturally involute without any long-term complications, conservative management (ie, observation) is recommended. However, long-term follow-up is required because individual patients with contralateral abnormalities may develop renal impairment as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Our current management approach for patients with unilateral MCDK includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial ultrasonographic evaluation to monitor contralateral kidney growth and MCDK involution at birth, and at 4 weeks, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Serial ultrasounds also may detect any significant renal scarring to the contralateral kidney due to recurrent urinary tract infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine follow-up that includes blood pressure measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], urinalysis to detect proteinuria, and renal function studies (eg, serum creatinine), especially in children with contralateral abnormalities who are at risk for developing chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>The necessity of performing a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG, which is an invasive study) in patients with MCDK has been increasingly questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>]. Although VUR has been reported to occur in 4 to 14 percent of contralateral kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/17,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31</a>], it is usually low grade and generally resolves in early life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>]. Patients with MCDK and VUR are also more likely to have ultrasonographic abnormalities of the contralateral kidney. In one study of 61 children with MCDK and VUR (documented by VCUG), only four had normal ultrasounds at birth and at one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, the authors concluded that performing a VCUG is unnecessary in patients with two successive normal renal ultrasound scans because it is highly unlikely that VUR is present. However, if there is significant contralateral hydronephrosis or a history of urinary tract infection, then a VCUG should be performed.</p><p>Although other centers have used renal scintigraphy as a diagnostic tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], we do not routinely perform renal scintigraphy as it does not change our management approach, and in some cases, there is detectable function of MCDK on renal scintigraphy making this an unreliable diagnostic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians have recommended resection to eliminate the risk of malignancy, particularly Wilms tumor; however, there appears to be no increased risk for Wilms tumor in MCDK. This was illustrated in a systematic literature review of 26 studies, in which there were <strong>no</strong> cases of Wilms tumor in the 1041 children with a unilateral MCDK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, a review article reported that data from the National Wilms Tumor Study Pathology Center demonstrated only one case of MCDK among more than 6000 cases of nephroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>However, an unequivocal diagnosis of MCDK is important because patients in whom the diagnosis is equivocal may actually have another potentially life-threatening disease, such as cystic Wilms tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459000895\"><span class=\"h3\">Segmental multicystic dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are case reports of segmental multicystic dysplasia that typically involves of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. These patients are managed conservatively similar to those with more extensive involvement. This entails ongoing follow-up care including monitoring of blood pressure and renal function and serial ultrasonography to demonstrate involution and spontaneous resolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95167550\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic disorders that may present with renal cystic disease in children include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystic kidney disease in children due to two hereditary conditions, which are discussed separately:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerular cortical cysts associated with genetic syndromes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysts due to tubular dilation or injury, which are associated with genetic syndromes</p><p/><p>Most of these hereditary disorders are due to defects in ciliary function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62947 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Renal ultrasound may be able to differentiate among some renal cystic disorders including nonhereditary causes, such as multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glomerular cortical cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular cysts due to genetic disorders can present as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In association with maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In association with genetic syndromes such as oro-facial-digital syndrome, Jeune syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, brachymesomelia-renal syndrome, and trisomy 13 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82584 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170183551\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations of the gene (<em>TCF2</em>) that encodes hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta (HNF-1-beta) are responsible for the syndrome referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 5 and are associated with renal cysts.

Polyuria and polydipsia are common and early symptoms due to a urinary concentrating defect. Urinary tract infections and hypertension are common manifestations. Chronic renal disease is a major complication and 10 percent of patients progress to ESRD during childhood. Mutations in at least 14 genes have been described in patients with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The genes most frequently involved are <em>BBS1</em> on chromosome 11q13, <em>BBS10</em> on chromosome 12q, <em>BBS2</em> on chromosome 16q21, and <em>BBS9</em> on chromosome 7p14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Clinical features include omphalocele, macroglossia, and macrosomia with height and weight &gt;97<sup>th</sup> percentile, asymmetric overgrowth of certain regions of the body, visceromegaly, and tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Neonatal hypoglycemia may be observed. Patients develop embryonic tumors such as Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, or rhabdomyosarcoma. Renal anomalies include medullary dysplasia, duplicated collecting system, nephrocalcinosis, medullary sponge kidney, cystic changes, diverticula, and nephromegaly.

These mutations result in severe tubular damage with thickened basement membranes alternating with groups of dilated or collapsed tubules, moderate interstitial fibrosis, and corticomedullary cysts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-nephronophthisis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of nephronophthisis&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ISOLATED RENAL CYSTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated renal cysts are commonly observed within the general population, and the prevalence rises with increasing age. For both affected adults and children, the principle clinical concern is accurately distinguishing simple renal cysts from complex renal cysts that are associated with malignancy. In adults, the Bosniak renal cyst classification categorizes cysts based on computerized tomographic (CT) findings into four categories, which separates benign cysts from those that are more likely to be associated with malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and complex renal cysts in adults&quot;, section on 'Bosniak classification of renal cysts'</a>.) </p><p>Simple renal cysts (Bosniak category I) with a thin wall without septa, calcifications, or solid components are most commonly seen in children. Children with isolated simple cysts, normal renal function, and no renal dysplasia have been followed for several years without evidence of deterioration in renal function or malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Complex renal cysts are uncommon in children; however, further evaluation is required because of the risk of malignancy. In one case series, surgical resection performed in 5 of 39 children with complex cysts revealed benign cysts in three and renal cell carcinoma in the other two patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-cystic-diseases-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Cysts may be due to nonhereditary fetal malformations (ie, cystic renal dysplasia) or genetic disorders, or, rarely, they may be acquired. Cysts may also occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the most severe form of cystic renal dysplasia. It consists of numerous noncommunicating cysts separated by dysplastic tissue with no identifiable renal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66837 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59147 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68485\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68485 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73581\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73581 \">image 4</a>). The diagnosis is most frequently made by antenatal ultrasound with an overall incidence of 0.3 to 1 per 1000 live births. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Multicystic dysplastic kidney'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because the natural history of MCDK is involution of the affected kidney and there are usually no associated complications, we recommend conservative management of MCDK (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Management consists of serial renal ultrasounds to monitor contralateral kidney growth and any evidence of renal scarring, and involution of the affected kidney. In addition, routine follow-up includes blood pressure measurements to detect hypertension, urinalysis to detect proteinuria, and renal function studies. (See <a href=\"#H95167046\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic disorders that present with renal cystic disease in children include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autosomal recessive and dominant polycystic kidney disease.

Renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome is due to mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-beta gene. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Glomerular cortical cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic syndromes that may present with tubular-derived cysts include Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Bardet-Biedel syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and nephronophthisis. (See <a href=\"#H170183611\" class=\"local\">'Tubular cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated renal cysts are commonly observed.
