Despite therapeutic and technological advances, some patients will have persistence of irradiated tumor or develop locoregional failure, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Radioresistance is a broad term that describes the relative resistance of individual cells, tissues, organs, or entire organisms to the biologic effects of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Mechanisms of radioresistance to RT in head and neck cancer and strategies used to overcome this resistance are discussed here. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is discussed in detail separately.

Individual patients with tumors of similar size and stage can respond very differently to RT.</p><p>Relevant factors are related to the primary tumor (volume, size, grade, human papillomavirus [HPV] status), the patient (hemoglobin levels, smoking status), and biologic factors (hypoxia, proliferation status, expression of DNA repair genes, and alterations of many other genes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical factors affecting radiation response</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary tumor characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complexity and variability of clinical outcomes in head and neck cancer are reflected in the spectrum of T stage descriptors used in the American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for the different primary sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Larger tumors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with more extensive local invasion have higher T classifications, corresponding to a likely higher malignant cell burden and poorer prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiation-related cell killing is a random event; the potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks induced by irradiation are distributed randomly throughout the radiation-sensitive cells and will not kill all cells. As tumor burden increases, the probability of lethally damaging all of the cancer cells decreases, even if the total dose is escalated to high levels.</p><p>The location of the primary tumor site may influence response to therapy. As an example, oral cavity tumors demonstrate poorer response to RT than laryngeal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Tumor grade may also play a role. Well-differentiated tumors, which retain the ability to accelerate repopulation during RT, are characteristically more radioresistant than their moderately and poorly differentiated counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Head and neck cancers associated with the HPV have an improved prognosis relative to their HPV-negative counterparts, most likely due to their enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17473817\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoglobin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower pretreatment hemoglobin levels (&lt;14.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for men and &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for women) are correlated with reduced local control and survival in patients with head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, the relationship between hemoglobin concentration, tumor oxygenation status, and radioresistance is complex. Most anemic patients have tumors that are hypoxic, but the absence of anemia does not ensure that a tumor will be well oxygenated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with head and neck cancer who continue to smoke during RT have lower rates of response and survival than patients who do not smoke during RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Biological factors determining radiation response</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The high-energy photons used in RT exert their biologic effects via secondary electrons generated in tissue through a process known as the Compton effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These secondary electrons induce DNA damage through both direct and indirect actions. With direct action, the electrons interact with and ionize atoms of the DNA helix. With indirect action, the electrons first ionize molecules around the DNA, such as water, producing highly reactive free radical species that then interact with and damage DNA. Unrepaired DNA damage leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, fatal chromosomal aberrations, and cell death. For photon radiation, the indirect mechanism predominates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The presence of oxygen enhances the indirect process by prolonging the life span of the highly reactive free radicals generated by indirect ionization. Additionally, oxygen decreases the ability of cells to repair sublethal DNA damage, reacting with the broken ends of DNA to create stable organic peroxides that are not as readily repaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Well-oxygenated cells are two and one-half to three times more radiosensitive than hypoxic cells (oxygen partial pressure [pO<sub>2</sub>] &lt;10 mmHg), a relationship described by the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER): the ratio of RT doses needed in hypoxic versus aerobic conditions to achieve the same biologic effect.</p><p>Intratumor hypoxia can be chronic, arising as the tumor outgrows the limits of its blood supply, or acute, when there is a disruption in microregional blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Tumor hypoxia in head and neck cancer correlates with radioresistance and is an adverse prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one report, patients with a median tumor pO<sub>2</sub> &gt;10 mmHg, compared with those with tumor pO<sub>2</sub> levels &lt;10 mmHg, had significantly better two-year local control (82 versus 41 percent), disease-free survival (70 versus 31 percent), and overall survival (80 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Other biologic mechanisms also modulate the link between hypoxia and radiosensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Many signaling pathways are impacted by hypoxia, including those involved in angiogenesis, glucose transport, pH regulation, and erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>As an example, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors plays an important role in the cellular response to oxygen homeostasis in vivo. HIF-1 alpha overexpression is seen in over one-half of all head and neck cancers and correlates with poor response to RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Overexpression of the HIF-1-regulated hypoxia-related protein lysyl oxidase is associated with increased metastases, progression, and death in patients with head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, there is also evidence that HIF-1 inhibition may both suppress and enhance the effects of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Repopulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repopulation is defined as regrowth of tumor cells after the initiation of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Potential mechanisms include accelerated stem cell division, loss in asymmetrical division, and cell recruitment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Accelerated stem cell division describes the shortening of the cell cycle after the start of RT. Loss in asymmetry refers to the shift in stem cells from asymmetric division, which produces one stem cell and one progenitor cell with limited self-renewal potential, to symmetric division, which gives rise to two identical stem cells. Lastly, quiescent cells in G0 phase may be recruited to re-enter more-active phases of the cell cycle.</p><p>Cyclins, cyclin inhibitors, Ki-67, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may all serve as markers of tumor proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Expression of Ki-67 and EGFR has been associated with radioresistance and has been studied to select patients for and predict response to regimens aimed to overcome repopulation, such as accelerated RT or anti-EGFR therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Inherent tumor cell radioresistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences in intrinsic tumor cell radiosensitivity are seen experimentally and may contribute significantly to radiation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Head and neck cancers associated with HPV have an improved prognosis relative to HPV-negative tumors. There are some data to suggest that the better prognosis of these tumors may be attributable to their enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer stem cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential role of cancer stem cells in radioresistance has been demonstrated in an increasing number of solid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. If not eliminated by RT, stem cells have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into the heterogeneous cells that constitute a tumor mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Experimental evidence suggests that a higher proportion of cancer stem cells within a tumor correlates with higher radioresistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Furthermore, cancer stem cells have been shown to possess inherent resistance mechanisms, such as amplified checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Extrinsic factors, such as hypoxia, may also impact the radioresistance of cancer stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radioresistance may also occur as a consequence of other biologic factors: amplification of DNA repair genes, increased cellular production of free radical scavengers (eg, glutathione), activation of certain protooncogenes, and stromal interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>As an example, the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 protein (ERCC1) is a drug-resistance-related DNA repair protein that prevents apoptosis of cancer cells by removing platinum-DNA adducts generated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. ERCC1 may also play a role in the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage. High expression of ERCC1 in nasopharyngeal cancer patients has been associated with poor survival after concurrent chemoradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, cells with a mutated p53 tumor suppressor gene fail to arrest at the <span class=\"nowrap\">G1/S</span> cell cycle checkpoint following irradiation and are less likely to undergo apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, overexpression of survivin, an oncogene of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, may contribute to treatment resistance via negative regulation of programmed cell death and enhanced DNA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Radioresistance involves a complex interplay between biologic processes.

Large tumors, continued smoking, and pretreatment anemia are clinical factors that have been inversely correlated with locoregional control. Tumor hypoxia, repopulation, cancer stem cells, and inherent differences in tumor cell radiosensitivity are biologic factors that have been identified as strongly correlating with radioresistance. In particular, human papilloma virus (HPV) status has emerged as a significant prognostic factor and predictor of response to radiation therapy (RT) in head and neck cancer. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of radioresistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care to improve outcomes in patients who are treated with RT for head and neck cancer. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival compared with RT alone for head and neck cancer patients with unresectable disease and for those in whom a functional organ preservation strategy provides a nonsurgical alternative for cure while maintaining quality of life.

Recognition of the influence of HPV status in treatment response has led to the design of clinical trials that separately investigate HPV-positive and HPV-negative patient populations. Methods to overcome radiation resistance will likely focus on HPV-negative tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various approaches to target hypoxia have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. Although these techniques may improve locoregional control, their clinical impact is less than that of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and they do not have a major role in the management of head and neck cancer patients. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Targeting hypoxia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the correction of anemia has a strong theoretical rationale, the available evidence does not support the routine use of transfusions or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with head and neck cancer, and these approaches may actually worsen outcomes. Thus, we recommend not using erythropoietic agents during RT for head and neck cancer.
