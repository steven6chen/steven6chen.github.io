Successful transitions typically require a scope of services, generally best provided by organizations with the capacity to provide a full spectrum of psychological, medical, and surgical care. Medical treatment often includes hormones to expose sex steroid-responsive target tissues to more estrogen and block androgen action. Commonly performed surgeries include facial feminization (craniomaxillofacial procedures), chest (&quot;top&quot;) surgery (eg, breast augmentation), and genital (&quot;bottom&quot;) surgery (eg, orchiectomy and vaginoplasty). Knowledge of these commonly performed procedures and the surgical techniques used will aid medical care providers in caring for transgender patients before, during, and after the transition process, and may help in the assessment and management of complications related to these surgeries.</p><p>This topic will review surgeries that are commonly performed as part of male-to-female transition.

Transitioning involves learning to express and live socially in the individual's desired gender role and may include feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical procedures (known as gender affirmation or confirmation surgery), depending on the individual's personal goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Mental health care and social support play a critical role throughout the transition process, and a multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of transgender individuals is recommended. Treatment, including hormonal therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery, is medically necessary to alleviate gender dysphoria in many individuals, and with treatment, many distressing symptoms may be alleviated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>Surgical options include feminizing procedures, breast (&quot;top&quot;) surgery, and genital (&quot;bottom&quot;) surgery. These procedures can be performed independently or in combination. The incidence of gender-affirming genital surgery appears to be increasing. An observational study of the United States National Inpatient Sample reported that, for inpatients with a diagnostic code for transsexualism or gender-identity disorder undergoing gender-affirming surgery, the incidence of genital surgery increased from 72 to 84 percent between the time periods 2000 to 2005 and 2006 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 44 percent of patients had insurance coverage for these procedures (private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid), which, in part, reflects data indicating that transgender care is both affordable and cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This increase in gender-affirming genital surgery highlights the need to prospectively assess quality metrics such as treatment efficacy, patient satisfaction, complications, and reversal surgery as well as ensure proper clinical training of surgeons and other health care providers. </p><p>A broad overview of the care of transgender individuals, including presentation, assessment, diagnosis, and medical management, is covered separately.

The first male-to-female genital surgeries were performed in the 1930s in Germany. At that time, the term &quot;transsexual&quot; had been coined by the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who cared for and studied transgender individuals.</p><p>Lili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman, is historically regarded as one of the first to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Dresden, Germany, in the 1930s. She underwent several surgeries and died from complications related to her final surgery. Wide publicity and attention was brought to the United States in the 1950s when Christine Jorgensen, a former United States Army soldier, was the first American to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Europe.</p><p>In the late 1950s, the French plastic surgeon Dr. Georges Burou developed the modern penile inversion vaginoplasty technique. Modifications of this technique are still commonly used today. Nearly a decade after Dr. Burou&rsquo;s work, gender affirmation surgery became available at some academic centers in the United States, including Johns Hopkins Medical Center and Stanford University. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, a shift in paradigm occurred, with most surgeries performed by private practicing surgeons. These operations are again returning to academic centers in the United States and formal training programs for this type of surgery are under development. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1986892965\"><span class=\"h1\">NONGENITAL/NONBREAST SURGERIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Nongenital/nonbreast</span> surgeries include a range of feminizing surgeries. While facial feminization and thyroid cartilage reduction are discussed here, other feminizing procedures include body contouring (eg, liposuction) and body implants (eg, buttock implants). There are no World Professional Association for Transgender Health guidelines or criteria that need to be met by patients for these types of surgeries. As such, no mental health care provider referral is required for these procedures as is required with chest (&quot;top&quot;) or genital (&quot;bottom&quot;) surgeries, but patients should be fully counseled and informed of the risks and benefits prior to proceeding with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3589560689\"><span class=\"h2\">Facial feminization surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different components of the face, including individual features (such as the eyes, jaw, or brow), facial configuration, and dimensional structure contribute to an individual's desired gender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115589 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

However, not all studies specifically reviewed surgical complications, and this finding should be interpreted with caution. While patient satisfaction appeared high, many of the included studies were limited by the use of nonvalidated techniques or instruments for measuring satisfaction. In a retrospective analysis of 33 patients who underwent a total of 180 facial feminization operations with a minimum follow-up of 24 months, all patients reported improvement in quality of life, measured as positive responses to a survey assessing physical, emotional, and social domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

A wider chest, greater muscle mass, and smaller, wider-set nipple-areolar complex with shorter distance to the inframammary crease may require adjustment in the planned location of the inframammary crease, release of the lower sternal attachments of the pectoralis major muscle, and alterations in implant positioning. For these reasons, an inframammary incision and subpectoral pocket with form-stable implants are commonly chosen for augmentation in transgender women, while a periareolar incision is usually avoided due to the smaller size of the areola [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Additional information on the surgical technique of breast augmentation in general is discussed separately.

Hair removal should be performed on the areas of the scrotum and perineum that will be used to line the neovagina (posterior to the penile shaft, approximately 2 cm medial to the groin creases and 4 to 5 cm anterior to the anus). The procedures may be performed on other genital hair-bearing areas, or they may be left intact to achieve the individual's desired hair distribution and aesthetic outcome following surgery. We do not use split-thickness skin grafts of scrotal tissue, which would potentially allow removal of the hair follicle layer, because the scrotal skin produces a much thinner graft and is difficult to split in such a way to separate the hair follicles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Laser hair removal uses a laser light source to target pigmented hair, destroying the follicle with heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=removal-of-unwanted-hair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Removal of unwanted hair&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thromboprophylaxis </strong>&ndash; Multiple factors may lead to the observed increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) observed in the male-to-female transgender population including the use of exogenous estrogen, prolonged surgical procedures, and postoperative bed rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Prior to surgery and in the perioperative period, the Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline recommends that surgeons and endocrinologists collaborate to manage hormone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In our practice, exogenous estrogen is held for three to four weeks prior to surgery and is not restarted until the patient has returned to light activity, generally two to four weeks postoperatively. Patients should receive appropriate VTE prophylaxis in the perioperative and postoperative periods. In our practice, patients receive prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and wear sequential compression devices in the preoperative and immediate postoperative period. Prophylactic subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> is then administered for one week following hospital discharge. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical consent</strong> &ndash; In addition to routine surgical risks such as bleeding and infection, surgical consent for vaginoplasty must address risks specific to this procedure. Our surgical consent for vaginoplasty contains the following language:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">&quot;We discussed the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure in great detail. The goal is to achieve good cosmesis and functioning; she understands that each body is different and results vary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Risks include, but are not limited to, <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/hemorrhage,</span> transfusion, hematoma, seroma, <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/abscess,</span> wound healing issues, injury to surrounding organs (bowel, rectum, bladder, urethra) and possible development of fistula, vaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/stricturing/shortening/narrowing,</span> abnormal urinary stream, urinary incontinence, inability to orgasm or change in orgasm, pain and scarring, neuropathies, and need for additional surgery.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotic prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; Guidelines for prophylactic antibiotic use do not exist for vaginoplasty in the transgender population; therefore, appropriate prophylaxis should be administered for urogenital procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The specific antibiotic selection and length of administration is based on expert opinion. In our practice, perioperative intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> is administered, followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for prevention of infection while the urinary catheter and vaginal packing remain in place up to one week following surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bowel preparation</strong> &ndash; The use of a mechanical bowel preparation prior to penile inversion vaginoplasty is surgeon dependent. Many experts may choose to perform some degree of modified bowel preparation prior to surgery to avoid fecal contamination in the rare event of a rectal injury, and to delay the immediate return of postoperative bowel movements while a vaginal packing is in place. Modified bowel preparation regimens may involve a combination of clear liquid diet the day prior to surgery and mechanical bowel preparation or enemas. Rectal wash out is performed at the time of surgery with povidone-iodine solution. For intestinal segment vaginoplasty, full mechanical bowel preparation and oral antibiotics are recommended to reduce the risk of surgical-site infection and anastomotic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraoperative positioning</strong> &ndash; Careful attention should be paid to surgical positioning given the potentially extended length of time required for the procedure. Patients should be positioned in dorsal lithotomy position in adjustable padded stirrups, keeping the hip, knee, and ankle aligned, avoiding hyperflexion or hyperextension of the knees and hips. The arms should be positioned out on arm boards for ease of access during penile inversion vaginoplasty, or with arms tucked in neutral position at the patient's sides for intestinal vaginoplasty, where laparoscopic abdominal access may be employed. Sufficient padding should line the operative table, and additional adhesive padding applied to the patient's heels and sacrum may be added for prevention of pressure sores.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4046856559\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of vaginoplasty surgery is to achieve an aesthetic and functional vagina, vulva, and clitoris. Patients should be counseled that each body is different and results will vary depending on body habitus, tissue availability, and other individual medical factors such as a history of prostatic disease. The most commonly performed technique, especially in the United States, is the penile inversion vaginoplasty. Many modifications of this technique exist, and one of these modifications is described below. Intestinal vaginoplasty procedures are also performed and described. Graft materials are mainly used in revision surgeries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3353206778\"><span class=\"h3\">Penile inversion vaginoplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common technique performed for primary male-to-female transgender vaginoplasty is penile inversion vaginoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The technique has been widely researched and described, and modifications have been made over time to improve aesthetic outcome and functional results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Penile inversion vaginoplasty is irreversible and generally includes orchiectomy (if not previously performed), penile deconstruction, formation of a sensate neoclitoris from a portion of the glans penis on its dorsal neurovascular pedicle, creation of a neourethral meatus, creation of a vaginal cavity and lining of the neovagina with local penoscrotal skin flaps, and labiaplasty to create an aesthetic and feminine external appearance of the genitalia. Surgery may be performed by a variety of surgical specialists in plastic surgery, urology, gynecology, and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery. </p><p>We use the following technique in performing modified penile inversion vaginoplasty, which is also presented in the video (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115676\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef115676 \">movie 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scrotal flap, which will later be used to line the neovagina, is marked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115678\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115678 \">figure 5</a>). The borders of the graft are the base of the penile shaft anteriorly, 2 cm medial to the groin creases laterally, and 4 to 5 cm above the anus posteriorly. The flap is incised sharply, then excised from the underlying subcutaneous tissue using electrosurgery. To prepare the graft, all excess subcutaneous tissue is removed sharply, creating a split thickness skin graft. If hair removal is suboptimal, remaining hair follicles can be electrosurgically coagulated. The graft is kept moist with saline-soaked sponges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, electrosurgery is used to remove excess subcutaneous tissue by skeletonizing the underlying penile structures down to Buck fascia. If testes are present, orchiectomy is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115679 \">figure 6</a>). A circumferential incision is made around the glans of the penis, thus freeing the epithelium from the underlying tunica albuginea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115680\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115680 \">figure 7</a>). If excess distal penile skin is present, the distal penile skin and prepuce may be left intact with the glans for later creation of a clitoral hood and labia minora. The penile structures are then sharply de-epithelized leaving a penile tube. The suspensory ligament of the penis is released. A urinary catheter is placed to drain the bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention is returned to the penile structures. A dorsal flap containing the dorsal penile neurovascular blood supply to the neoclitoris (created from a portion of the dorsal glans penis) and a ventral urethral flap are created. The deep penile arteries are ligated at the inferior margins of the crura of the corpora cavernosa. The corpora cavernosa, located between the dorsal clitoral flap and the ventral urethral flap, is excised (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115681\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115681 \">figure 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The excess glans is excised and the clitoral flap is folded on itself to position the neoclitoris approximately 5 cm above the intended location of the neourethral meatus. The flap is secured to the underlying fascia. Care must be taken not to kink the blood supply or place the flap on tension, which could result in necrosis of the neoclitoris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115682 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess corpus spongiosum is excised from the urethral flap. The urethra is transected in the midline on the ventral side over the catheter until the level of the pubic bone to ensure that the urethral meatus will lie flush with the bony pelvis to avoid urinary stream spraying. The urethral flap is trimmed and secured to the underlying fascia, leaving a mucosal bridge lining the area between the neourethral meatus and the neoclitoris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115683\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115683 \">figure 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention is then turned to creation of the neovagina. A transverse incision is made in the perineum below the bulbous urethra, transecting the perineal tendon and creating a cavity by separating the levator ani muscles laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115684 \">figure 11</a>). Dissection is performed, first sharply and then bluntly. Our preference is to perform this dissection with one finger inside the rectum and the other in the neovaginal cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115685 \">figure 12</a>). Care is taken to delineate the borders of the rectum and to palpate the urinary catheter during the dissection to avoid injury to the rectum or lower urinary tract. Dissection is carried past the level of the prostatic urethra anterior to the rectoprostatic fascia for a total length of approximately 15 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115686 \">figure 13</a>). Once adequate caliber and depth are achieved, meticulous hemostasis is obtained to avoid hematoma formation. A bubble test may be performed to assess for rectal injury by filling the neovagina with irrigation solution, then insufflating the rectum using a large syringe. If bubbles are seen in the neovaginal cavity, further investigation for rectal injury should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prepared graft is sewn onto a large vaginal stent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115687 \">figure 14</a>). The stent is then passed through the penile tube and the flaps are sutured together (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115688 \">figure 15</a>). The vaginal tube and stent are then placed into the neovaginal cavity, and the stent is removed. Mattress sutures are placed to take tension off the flap, and the vagina is tightly packed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incision is made anteriorly through the penile flap, exposing the underlying clitoris, mucosal urethral flap, and urethral meatus. Labia minora and a clitoral hood are created using the maintained distal penile skin, or can alternatively be created by suturing the edges of the anterior penile flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115689 \">figure 16</a>). Drains are placed to drain the labia majora, and the labia majora incision lines are closed in an aesthetically appealing way (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115690 \">figure 17</a>). Immediate postoperative results are shown in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115675\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115675 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964853997\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal vaginoplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transgender women with penoscrotal hypoplasia or those who have failed a primary penile inversion vaginoplasty procedure may be candidates for intestinal vaginoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Intestinal vaginoplasty involves use of a segment of small intestine (ileum) or sigmoid colon to create a neovagina, with the advantages of self-lubrication, depth, and reduced risk of stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Disadvantages of the procedure include the risks of abdominal surgery and the creation of a bowel anastomosis, excessive discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malodor, and prolapse of the neovagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients with a history of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or extensive intraabdominal adhesions are not candidates for this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The procedure is performed through a combined abdominal and perineal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The perineal portion of the procedure includes perineal dissection of the neovaginal cavity, disassembly of the penile structures, formation of a neoclitoris, neourethreal meatus, labia minora, labia majora, and bowel-perineal anastomosis. The neovaginal dissection, penile disassembly, and creation of vulvar structures are performed similarly to the techniques described above for penile inversion vaginoplasty. (See <a href=\"#H3353206778\" class=\"local\">'Penile inversion vaginoplasty'</a> above.)</p><p>The abdominal portion may be performed via laparoscopy, laparoscopic-assisted laparotomy, or laparotomy, depending on surgeon experience, and includes harvest of an intestinal segment (ileum or sigmoid colon) on its vascular pedicle and bowel anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Surgeons may also choose to perform a suspension procedure to the sacral promontory to prevent prolapse of the neovagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3779199238\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of graft materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of nongenital full-thickness or split-thickness skin grafts is less common and is generally reserved for revision surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,32</a>]. Few small retrospective studies have described surgical technique, complications, and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one study, revision vaginoplasty was performed using abdominal full-thickness skin grafts in six patients with no reported postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. All patients reported satisfaction with the results and the ability to have sexual intercourse. Vaginal depth was reported as 12 cm at 7 months (range 3 to 18 months). Others have described the use of a penile skin graft and a split-thickness graft (n = 12) or penile flap and inguinopudendal neurovascular island pedicle flap (n = 109) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Complications reported included vaginal stenosis (n = 5 in the first group, n = 4 in the second group), and urethral meatus stricture (n = 7) in the second group. Other reported complications were neovaginal hair growth and flap necrosis in the inguinopudendal flap group. Adequate vaginal depth of 8 to 10 cm was reported.</p><p>A prospective study of transgender women undergoing penile inversion vaginoplasty with penile skin length of 7 to 12 cm added an additional full-thickness skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Satisfaction, sexual function, and genital self-image were evaluated. Thirty-two patients out of 100 included in the study underwent penile-inversion vaginoplasty with additional full-thickness skin graft augmentation. Aesthetic outcome as reported by both patients and clinicians improved over time, and satisfaction scores did not differ significantly between groups. Preoperative penile skin length was significantly shorter in the full-thickness skin graft group (14.6&plusmn;1.8 cm versus 11.5&plusmn;2.3 cm, p &lt;0.001), but postoperative mean neovaginal depth at one year did not differ between groups (11.3&plusmn;2.7 cm versus 11.6&plusmn;2.1 cm, p = 0.65). Sexual function as assessed by the Female Sexual Function Index was not different between groups, but scores were below levels consistent with sexual dysfunction in cisgender women. Genital self-image as assessed by the Female Genital Self-Image Scale was not different between groups and scores were indicative of positive self-image.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630443432\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperatively, pain is controlled with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and, once diet is advanced, oral narcotic pain medication. Diet is restricted to ice chips on postoperative day 0, then advanced to clear liquids on postoperative day 1 and later to a regular diet as tolerated. A stool softener is administered for bowel regimen. Activity is initially restricted to bed rest in beach chair position to avoid undue tension on the suture lines or pressure on the grafts until the dressings and drains are removed on postoperative day 2 to 3. After drain removal, activity can be increased to light ambulation. Tight vaginal packing and an indwelling bladder catheter remain in place until postoperative day 6 to 7, when they are removed and vaginal dilation is taught. Vaginal dilation is performed using progressively larger rigid dilators three times daily for 12 weeks, then once to twice daily for another 12 weeks. Six months after surgery, patients are encouraged to dilate at least weekly if they are sexually active, or daily if they are not. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1870789556\"><span class=\"h2\">Special populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2704510050\"><span class=\"h3\">Revision surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a retrospective study of 475 transgender women who underwent penile inversion vaginoplasty, revision vaginoplasty was performed in 14 patients (2.9 percent), all secondary to neovaginal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In comparison with primary penile inversion vaginoplasty, revision vaginoplasty carries higher rates of complications, including intraoperative rectal injuries and postoperative complications such as fistula formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Surgery is more difficult due to adhesions and contracture of previous grafts. Options for revision include intestinal vaginoplasty or full-thickness skin grafts from various donor sites. Each technique carries different and specific advantages and disadvantages. Intestinal vaginoplasty provides depth, natural lubrication, and lower risk of stenosis but confers the risk of bowel-related complications. The use of full-thickness skin grafts is less invasive and avoids abdominal surgery, but carries complications related to skin grafting including donor site scarring, graft contracture, and poor graft taking.</p><p>A retrospective comparison of laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty versus perineal full-thickness skin graft vaginoplasty performed in 50 transgender women and 3 cisgender women reported two rectal perforations (10 percent) and one bladder neck injury in the intestinal group and six rectal perforations (19 percent; p = 0.46) in the full-thickness perineal skin graft group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Operative time was significantly shorter for the perineal skin graft group (130&plusmn;35 minutes) than for the laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty group (191&plusmn;45 minutes; p &lt;0.01). Intraoperative intestinal neovaginal length was significantly greater after intestinal vaginoplasty, but adequate intraoperative depth was able to be achieved in 31 of 32 skin graft vaginoplasties. Both groups were hospitalized for a mean of eight days. Complications in the laparoscopic intestinal vaginoplasty group leading to prolonged hospitalization included fecal peritonitis in a patient with intraoperative rectal perforation, stenosis of the anastomosis, and intestinal torsion. In the perineal skin graft group, prolonged hospitalization occurred secondary to rectal perforation in three patients and superficial wound infection in one patient. In long-term follow-up (median 3.8 years, range 1.1 to 19.7 years), nearly all sigmoid neovaginas (90 percent) and perineal skin graft neovaginas (80 percent; p = 0.45) were of adequate depth for intercourse. Two sigmoid neovaginas required removal, one due to compromised vasculature and necrosis, the other due to excessive fibrosis. Five cases of complete stenosis were observed in the perineal skin graft group. Other complications in the intestinal group included one case of neovaginal prolapse and two cases of introital stenosis. In the skin graft group, three patients underwent revision of the labia majora, and two were treated for granulation tissue at the neovaginal apex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H771829200\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients on puberty blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents who meet eligibility and readiness criteria may initiate hormone therapy beginning with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) puberty hormone suppression, later incorporating cross-sex steroids for development of secondary sexual characteristics congruent with the individual's gender identity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Corpus spongiosum bleeding is typically treated by applying pressure or hemostatic agents as suturing this delicate tissue often worsens the bleeding. Excessive bleeding may also occur during the neovaginal dissection and result from disruption of branches of the inferior gluteal, inferior vesical, and pudendal vascular supply to the levator ani [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Surgical management with direct visualization and ligation of bleeding vessels is preferred. Interventional radiology embolization of bleeding vessels is generally not recommended, as this may compromise the flaps and result in flap necrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rectal injury &ndash; In cases of intraoperative rectal injury, primary layered closure may be undertaken, and a protective colostomy may be considered to allow for wound healing and prevention of rectovaginal fistula formation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinary tract injury &ndash; Urethral or bladder injuries are typically managed with primary layered closure and prolonged urinary catheter drainage. Ureteral injury is a rare complication as the ureters are not in close proximity to the operative field. If a ureteral injury is suspected, or if a cystotomy is encountered near the bladder trigone that raises concern for ureteral compromise, intraoperative specialist consultation can be obtained to discuss possible imaging (eg, retrograde pyelogram) and ureteral stenting. No specific surgical considerations are needed to address the fact that these patients have a prostate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediate postoperative</strong> &ndash; In the immediate postoperative period, bleeding, hematoma or seroma, wound infection or abscess, wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, or venous thromboembolic events may be observed. Postoperative rectovaginal or pararectal abscess or feculent vaginal discharge should alert the surgeon to the possibility of an undetected rectal injury, and further investigation including imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> examination under anesthesia is recommended. Neovaginal prolapse may require local excision in the setting of a sigmoid neovagina if the prolapse is limited to mucosa only, or neovaginopexy may be performed for complete prolapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late postoperative</strong> &ndash; Late postoperative complications include neovaginal or introital stenosis, genitourinary or rectovaginal fistula formation, abdominal urinary stream (ie, upward or abnormal urinary stream), urethral meatal stenosis, and sexual dysfunction. Patients with significant complications should be referred to the original surgeon or to a surgeon with expertise in vaginoplasty techniques for assessment and management. In cases of vaginal stenosis, revision surgery may be indicated for severe stenosis (complete neovaginal revision) or an obvious skin bridge or scar obstructing the introits (introitus plasty). Other cases of neovaginal or introital stenosis may be managed conservatively with neovaginal dilation. Urethral meatal stenosis often presents as abnormal urinary stream spraying and may be addressed by release of the stenosis or revision of an obstructing skin bridge. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Minor postoperative complications that can be managed in the office may include vaginal spotting, vaginitis, and hair growth in the neovagina. Vaginal spotting often occurs secondary to granulation tissue formation in the neovagina and can be managed locally with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> or excision. A trial of vaginal estrogen may be acceptable, although there is no evidence for this intervention. Yeast vaginitis may occur as a result of the warm, moist neovaginal environment, and postoperative skin sloughing may also contribute to symptoms of excessive discharge and malodor. Douching with a vinegar or povidone-iodine solution, or with a mixture of baby soap and warm water may be recommended for routine hygiene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. If preoperative hair removal procedures are not performed or are inadequate, excessive hair growth within the neovagina may lead to tangling and knotting, which requires trimming and removal in the office setting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2073149423\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The types and frequency of complications vary with the surgical techniques.

Transitioning involves learning to express and live socially in the individual's desired gender role, and may include feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"#H45798598\" class=\"local\">'Overview of transition process'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) is an international professional society dedicated to promoting the highest evidence-based principles for the care of transsexual, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-surgery-male-to-female/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <a href=\"http://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1351&amp;token=7AD/4zdF4rvJFrwVzxt3BICVBX1UOttmkdiTBATnrT3uUAqRFw+1HXpEBRELnEvqQIpiDfE5JaeriQhaVoQn7RGxT0s+MqjpibBscSstGp0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=114517\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Standards of Care</a> are a series of flexible guidelines for clinical practice set forth by the society based on evidence and expert consensus. (See <a href=\"#H307139771\" class=\"local\">'WPATH Standards of Care'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common <span class=\"nowrap\">nongenital/nonbreast</span> surgeries include a combination of procedures for facial feminization and thyroid cartilage reduction (chondrolaryngoplasty). (See <a href=\"#H1986892965\" class=\"local\">'Nongenital/nonbreast surgeries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest, or top, surgery typically consists of breast augmentation with implants after a period of feminizing hormone therapy. WPATH has created criteria for chest surgery (ie, breast augmentation in male-to-female transgender individuals). (See <a href=\"#H511423105\" class=\"local\">'Chest (top) surgery (breast augmentation)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genital, or bottom, gender confirmation surgery consists of vaginoplasty and orchiectomy, if not already performed. WPATH provides criteria to help assess candidate appropriateness. (See <a href=\"#H795407057\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative planning and care'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The goal of vaginoplasty surgery is to achieve an aesthetic and functional vagina, vulva, and clitoris. The most commonly performed technique, especially in the United States, is the penile inversion vaginoplasty. Intestinal vaginoplasty procedures are also performed and described. Graft materials are mainly limited to revision surgeries or patients taking puberty blockers with resultant penoscrotal hypoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H4046856559\" class=\"local\">'Surgical techniques'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who require revision surgery or who have been treated with puberty-blocking drugs have unique considerations for their care. (See <a href=\"#H1870789556\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intraoperative complications of vaginoplasty include bleeding and injury of the surrounding organs. Common immediate postoperative period complications include bleeding, hematoma or seroma, wound infection or abscess, wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, or venous thromboembolic events. Late postoperative complications include neovaginal or introital stenosis, genitourinary or rectovaginal fistula formation, urethral meatal stenosis, and sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H3057875782\" class=\"local\">'Type of complication by timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are no standardized outcome measures for transgender surgery, and the sample sizes of available studies are small, which limits direct comparison of the surgical techniques. Vaginoplasty procedures appear to result in functional sexual anatomy and satisfied patients in the majority of cases.
