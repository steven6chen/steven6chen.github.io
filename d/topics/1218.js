This may refer to infections that are too great in number, too severe, or too long lasting that are associated with unusual complications or that fail to resolve with standard therapy. The causes are multiple and can be grouped into four categories: the &quot;normal&quot; child, the child with atopic disease, the child with another chronic condition, and the child with an immunodeficiency.</p><p>The approach to the child with recurrent infections will be reviewed here. Laboratory studies evaluating the function of the immune system and specific immunodeficiencies are discussed briefly here and in more detail elsewhere.

Most often, these categories can be determined from the history, physical examination, and screening investigations.</p><p>Recurrent infections are infections that are too great in number, too severe, or too long lasting. Recurrent infections are defined as two or more severe infections in one year, three or more respiratory infections (eg, sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis) in one year, or the need for antibiotics for two <span class=\"nowrap\">months/year</span>. <span class=\"nowrap\">Severe/serious</span> infections include those with persistent fever or confinement to bed for a week or more, failure to respond to oral antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the need for intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization, infections with an unusual pathogen, unusual complications (eg mastoiditis, pleural effusion, abscesses), or persistent laboratory abnormalities (eg, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate <span class=\"nowrap\">[ESR]/C-reactive</span> protein [CRP], persistent imaging abnormalities).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5015731\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following features should lead to suspicion of an immunodeficiency and consideration of referral to an immunology specialist for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>] (the first 10 are modified from the 10 Warnings Signs of PID created by the Jeffrey Modell Foundation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of immunodeficiency or unexplained early death (eg, before age 30 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to gain weight or grow normally (failure to thrive)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for intravenous antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization to clear infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six or more ear or respiratory tract infections within one year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more serious sinus infections or pneumonias within one year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four or more new ear infections within one year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more episodes of sepsis or meningitis in a lifetime</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more months of antibiotics with little effect</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent or resistant oral or cutaneous candidiasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent deep skin or organ abscesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection caused by an unusual microbial organism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in an unusual location</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications from a live vaccine (eg, rotavirus, varicella, and Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin [BCG] vaccines)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonhealing wounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive skin lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent lymphopenia (a count of &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/uL</span> in patients over five years and &lt;2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/uL</span> in younger children)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained autoimmunity or fevers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulomas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma in infancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Features typical of syndromic PIDs (eg, cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromic-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromic immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Family history of immunodeficiency was the most predictive factor of any PID in a retrospective survey of 563 children who presented to two pediatric immunodeficiency centers for evaluation of possible PID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, the use of intravenous antibiotics for sepsis and failure to thrive were strong identifiers of neutrophil PID and T cell PID, respectively.</p><p>In infants, additional features suggestive of a PID include hypocalcemia with or without seizures, congenital heart defects (mainly conotruncal anomalies), absence of thymic shadow on chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67690 \">image 1</a>), and delayed umbilical cord detachment (&gt;30 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is considered a pediatric emergency, and special precautions should be taken if this diagnosis is suspected.

The percentages seen in each group listed below are based upon the author's clinical experience and may vary regionally depending upon the population and referral patterns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The &quot;normal&quot; child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of children with recurrent infections referred for evaluation have no known significant cause for these infections.</p><p>Infants and children vary considerably as to the number of infections experienced. The average child has four to eight respiratory infections per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Some infants and young children who are kept away from strangers have only one or two infections per year. Others may have 10 to 12 infections per year, particularly if they have older siblings or if they attend daycare or preschool. Exposure to passive smoking also increases the risk of upper respiratory infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The mean duration of viral respiratory symptoms is eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the normal range can extend beyond two weeks, which means that the &quot;normal&quot; child with over 10 viral respiratory infections can have symptoms for nearly one-half of a year.</p><p>With regard to the number and types of infections seen, most of the respiratory infections are viral. These children generally do not have more than one episode of pneumonia or more than two episodes of uncomplicated otitis media in the first three years of life.</p><p>These children have normal growth and development, respond quickly to appropriate treatment, recover completely, and appear healthy between infections. The physical examination and laboratory tests are normal. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>An unusual cause of recurrent infection in a normal child is Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of child abuse. These children have a history of repeated illnesses, based upon the testimony of the caretaker (usually the mother), that often require repeated diagnostic procedures, treatment with multiple medicines, and frequent school absenteeism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalizations. Common infectious complaints include fever, cough, recurrent skin infections, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. These illnesses are not validated by repeated medical examinations, and the child often gets better in the hospital or in the absence of the caregiver.</p><p>Occasionally, the caregiver induces an infection by putting contaminated material (saliva, urine, feces) in an intravenous line, on the skin, or in the ears. Bacterial cultures are mixed and mimic the profile present in the contaminating material.</p><p>The caregiver often resists stopping medications (such as antibiotics or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> infusions) or discharging the child from the hospital. In addition, the caregiver often has a history of abnormal behavior and may be seeking attention. A full description of the syndrome is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The child with atopic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 percent of children with recurrent infections have atopic disease. Chronic allergic rhinitis may be mistaken for chronic or recurrent upper respiratory infections. Children with atopic disease often develop coughing and wheezing following viral respiratory infections. These symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed as pneumonia or bronchitis rather than reactive airways <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/asthma</span>. These episodes respond poorly to antibiotics but well to <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/asthma</span> medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with atopic disease are more likely to develop recurrent and persistent upper respiratory infections, such as sinusitis, rhinitis, and otitis media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This increased susceptibility to infection may be due to enhanced adherence of pathogens to inflamed respiratory epithelium, increased mucosal permeability, or an altered immune response to certain viral and bacterial pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The specific type of infection tends to recur in a given child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-rhinosinusitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Predisposing factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Growth and development are usually normal. Children with atopy often have characteristic physical findings, such as &quot;allergic shiners&quot; or a transverse nasal crease. A total immunoglobulin E (IgE) is sometimes included in the laboratory screening for immunodeficiency. A normal total IgE tends to exclude IgE-mediated allergy, although it may be falsely negative in an infant. An elevated IgE (eg, &gt;100 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> is suggestive of allergy, but an elevated IgE alone is not diagnostic for atopic disease. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'General screening tests'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note that primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) and allergic disease can coexist. In a retrospective series of children evaluated for PID, 31 percent (9 of 29) who had evidence of antigen-specific IgE by skin prick or blood testing were diagnosed with an immunodeficiency compared with 9 percent (6 of 68) of those who were negative on specific IgE testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Immunodeficiencies with associated atopy include selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and DiGeorge syndrome. Immunodeficiencies in which elevated levels of IgE are seen include hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome due to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<em>STAT3</em>) mutations, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Omenn syndrome, IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) syndrome, dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, and lipopolysaccharide-responsive-beige-like-anchor (LRBA) deficiency.

The child with a nonimmune chronic illness often presents with poor <span class=\"nowrap\">growth/failure</span> to thrive, a sickly appearance, and physical findings characteristic of the specific chronic disease. Diseases in this category include cystic fibrosis, gastroesophageal reflux, congenital heart disease, and chronic aspiration. Patients may also have an underlying anatomic defect.

Components of the adaptive immune system include B cells (humoral or antibody system) and T cells (cellular system). The innate immune system is made up of the phagocytic cell system and the complement system. Other components of the innate immune system include Toll-like receptor (TLR) transduction factors, mannose-binding protein, and respiratory tract cilia.</p><p>Immunodeficiency may be secondary or primary. Secondary immunodeficiencies usually occur well after infancy, while most PIDs are inherited and present during the first years of life. Both primary and secondary immunodeficiency can lead to an increased susceptibility to malignancy and autoimmune disease. PIDs most often affect B cell function, while secondary immunodeficiencies more often affect T cells (the cellular system).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5016183\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary immunodeficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of PIDs is 1 in 10,000.

More than 300 disorders, many genetically defined, have been characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/2,5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,20</a>]. The type and pattern of recurring infections depend on which components of the immune system are affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74045 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/2,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7</a>].

In addition, the rate of infections drops remarkably after early childhood. (See <a href=\"#H5015731\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features suggestive of a primary immunodeficiency'</a> above.)</p><p>Almost three-fourths of the PIDs are caused by an antibody (B cell) deficiency or a combined antibody plus cellular (T cell) abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80845 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Isolated T cell defects, as well as phagocytic cell, complement, and other innate immune defects, are much less common.

Chronic disease and certain PIDs, most notably the syndromic immunodeficiencies, such as ataxia-telangiectasia and DiGeorge syndrome, can lead to delay in attaining developmental milestones. Progressive neurologic dysfunction is seen in young adults with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Delayed speech can occur with recurrent and chronic otitis media.

Patients with T cell deficiencies or who are on immunosuppressive drugs including glucocorticoids may develop progressive infections following live-virus vaccines. A person who develops infections despite immunization may be immunodeficient and should be evaluated, including measuring the antibody response to the vaccine.</p><p>The immunization record is also valuable when examination of vaccine titers is planned to evaluate antibody function.

Inheritance patterns are variable. Many immunodeficiencies have X-linked transmission (eg, some forms of agammaglobulinemia and chronic granulomatous disease [CGD]). An autosomal-recessive pattern is seen in conditions such as some complement defects and ataxia-telangiectasia. An inconstant familial tendency may also be seen (eg, common variable immunodeficiency [CVID], selective immunoglobulin A [IgA] deficiency, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Inquiring about consanguinity is important when considering autosomal-recessive immunodeficiencies.

Premature infants, especially those needing respirators or intravenous catheters, are at high risk for infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several PIDs are associated with early onset of severe infections, notably congenital neutropenias, leukocyte-adhesion defects, SCID, and complete DiGeorge syndrome. Defects in Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) transduction are associated with herpes-simplex encephalitis of the newborn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Six months to two years</strong> &ndash; Infants and children presenting with infection from six months to two years of age may fall into any of the four categories listed above (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Major causes'</a> above). Normal infants exposed to other children or to tobacco smoke are more prone to recurrent respiratory infections. Wheezing, <span class=\"nowrap\">eczema/atopic</span> dermatitis, and food intolerance suggest allergy. Persistent diarrhea, chronic cough, or failure to thrive suggests cystic fibrosis or a PID. Congenital antibody deficiencies and many combined immunodeficiencies (eg, zeta-chain associated protein 70 [ZAP-70] deficiency, CD25 deficiency) usually present at 7 to 12 months, as maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) disappears.

Secondary immunodeficiencies resulting from malignancy, nephrotic syndrome, or gastrointestinal problems often begin at this age. Gastrointestinal disorders can cause loss of protein or specific vitamin or mineral deficiencies due to malabsorption. Daycare or school entry often results in frequent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Less serious antibody deficiencies (eg, IgA deficiency and selective antibody deficiency) and combined immunodeficiencies also first present at this age. As examples, persistent candidiasis suggests chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMCC), ataxia with infections suggests ataxia-telangiectasia, and growth retardation with infections suggests cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

Most upper respiratory infections are viral.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic purulent nasal discharge and cough secondary to postnasal drainage suggest chronic sinusitis. Refractory asthma is sometimes associated with chronic sinusitis. Gastroesophageal reflux can also cause chronic cough and recurrent otitis media and sinusitis. Persistently opacified sinuses, particularly cases refractory to antibiotics, may be due to an antibody deficiency or cystic fibrosis in a small subset of patients. Unilateral purulent nasal discharge suggests a foreign body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Allergic disease is associated with chronic or seasonal clear nasal discharge, congestion, itchy eyes, nocturnal cough, and a poor response to antibiotics. Allergic rhinitis can be misdiagnosed as recurrent upper respiratory infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nystatin-resistant or recurrent candidiasis (after three months of age), stomatitis, gingivitis, and oral ulcerations occur in T cell and phagocytic cell disorders.

However, reactive airways <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/asthma</span> is often misdiagnosed as pneumonia or bronchitis in young children. Recurrent pneumonia limited to a particular anatomic region (eg, right middle lobe) is typically caused by a local anatomic abnormality (eg, foreign body, bronchial compression by mediastinal adenopathy or vascular anomaly, bronchial sequestration or cyst). By contrast, patients with sequential lower respiratory tract infections involving different regions of the lung often have an underlying systemic disorder (eg, cystic fibrosis, immotile cilia syndrome, recurrent aspiration).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood and brain </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Bacterial meningitis and sepsis suggest an antibody deficiency or complement defect. Chronic enteroviral encephalomyelitis occurs in patients with profound antibody deficiency and commonly follows oral polio vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Recurrent meningitis or meningitis with an unusual organism may occur with structural defects of the cribriform plate, inner ear (Mondini defect), or sinuses. The last is sometimes a complication of sinus surgery. A cerebrospinal fluid leak through the nose, ear, or sinuses may occur with structural defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Brain abscesses usually result from parameningeal foci of infection, such as sinusitis or mastoiditis. Remote infections that seed the systemic arterial supply, such as lung abscesses and infective endocarditis, can also result in brain abscesses. These brain infections should be distinguished from brain tumors and from lymphocytic infiltrates in the brain, which are often responsive to immunosuppressive agents (glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">abatacept</a>).

Response to protein antigens can be assessed by measurement of titers to tetanus, diphtheria, pneumococcal conjugate, and <em>H. influenzae</em> type b (anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate [PRP] IgG) vaccines. Response to polysaccharide antigens can be determined by measurement of titers to polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (unconjugated) in adults and children over 24 months of age. We recommend a 23-valent panel, available in many commercial laboratories. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing the immunologic response to vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note whether or not the patient has received a conjugated (pneumococcal-conjugated vaccine 7 [PCV7] or pneumococcal-conjugated vaccine 13 [PCV13]) or <span class=\"nowrap\">unconjugated/polysaccharide</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> 23 [PPV23]) pneumococcal vaccine. Positive titers to serotypes in the conjugated vaccine (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F in both Prevnar 7 and Prevnar 13 and 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A only in Prevnar 13) indicate an ability to respond to polysaccharides conjugated to protein antigens. To determine the ability to respond to pure polysaccharide antigens, the response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine must be determined. The 23-serotype antibody panel includes the serotypes present in the PPV23 and the PCV13 vaccines. Children two to five years of age should respond to at least 50 percent of the polysaccharide antigens (1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or greater), and older patients (6 to 60) should respond to at least 70 percent of the polysaccharide antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A novel way to test for polysaccharide responsiveness uses parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine antibodies to <em>Salmonella enterica</em> <em>Typhi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These antibodies are not present in most individuals and therefore are not present in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> preparations. Thus, the vaccine response can be evaluated even in individuals on immune globulin replacement therapy. The antibody test is commercially available.</p><p>The author's approach is to assess baseline titers to pneumococcal serotypes. If titers are deficient and the child is over two years, the author gives unconjugated pneumococcal vaccine and rechecks titers in four to six weeks. If titers are still low, a conjugated vaccine is given, and titers are retested again. This will determine if the patient can respond to protein and polysaccharide antigens.</p><p>Natural antibodies, such as isoagglutinins (isoantibodies to blood group antigens; anti-A, anti-B), anti-streptolysin titers, and <em>Escherichia coli</em> antibodies are of less value, particularly in the young infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Complement activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement activity should be assessed in patients with recurrent sepsis or neisserial infection. The screening test is a total hemolytic complement determination (CH50). A normal CH50 level excludes nearly all hereditary complement deficiencies. Levels of individual complement components are measured if the CH50 is significantly reduced or zero. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Complement component'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system#H5551391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;, section on 'Complement defects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further testing is warranted when screening tests are abnormal or if there is a convincing history of immunodeficiency. These intermediate tests should provide some guidance as to which specific disorders must be considered and confirmed by additional studies. These tests should be undertaken in consultation with a pediatric immunologist.

Comparison with age-matched controls is necessary (infants and young children normally have lymphocytosis compared with adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections/abstract/2,5,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,48</a>]. Patients with low levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) on newborn SCID screening should have T and B cell analysis by flow cytometry. A few infants with T cell lymphopenia first detected by newborn TREC testing will remain well and have idiopathic T cell lymphopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CD4 count is the most valuable reflection of the cellular immune system. An absolute CD4 count of &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/uL</span> in a person over five years of age or &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/uL</span> in younger children suggests a cellular immunodeficiency. The addition of markers of na&iuml;ve (CD45RA, CD62L) and memory (CD45R0) T cells is important in infants with features suggestive of SCID but in whom the total T cell count is higher than what is expected in SCID infants. In infants with Omenn syndrome or with SCID and maternal engraftment, the majority of circulating T cells have a memory phenotype. An absolute B cell (CD19) count of &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/uL</span> suggests hereditary agammaglobulinemia but, if a concurrent severe T cell deficiency is detected, is indicative of T-B- SCID. A low <span class=\"nowrap\">CD16/56</span> count (&lt;2 percent) suggests a natural killer cell deficiency. Low levels of any lymphocyte subset should be repeated and, if confirmed, followed by functional analysis of the respective immune system component.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaccine challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccine responsiveness is used to further assess the antibody system. A killed vaccine that has not been administered previously is given, and titers are measured before and four to six weeks after vaccination. The unconjugated pneumococcal vaccine is typically used to assess response to polysaccharide antigens (see <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Antibody titers'</a> above). Other inactivated vaccines that the child has not yet received can be used to measure antibody function, such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningococcal, and polio vaccines.

A complete absence of IgG1, IgG2, or IgG3 suggests immune dysregulation and may indicate the early onset of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). A low level of one or more IgG subclasses does not, by itself, indicate an antibody deficiency. Functional antibody studies must show a defect. These studies are not recommended by some immunologists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, either by antibody titers or polymerase-chain reaction (PCR), should be done in any patient suspected of a T cell deficiency.

Children under age two years often have negative tests despite intact cellular immunity. The usual skin tests employ <em>Candida</em> antigen, tetanus or tetanus-diphtheria antigen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tuberculin. A documented history of <em>Candida</em> infection; a recent diphtheria, tetanus, or Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine; or a previously positive tuberculin reaction is necessary to interpret a response to these antigens.

The ability of lymphocytes to proliferate to mitogens (phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin, pokeweed), stimulatory monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3, alone or in combination with anti-CD28 and anti-CD2), or allogeneic cells (in a mixed leukocyte reaction) indicates intact lymphocyte activation to nonspecific stimuli. Diminished or absent proliferation to mitogens signals a serious derangement of T cell function, such as SCID.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Major causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary disorders of immune function should be considered in infants and children who have recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complicated bacterial infections (eg, sinopulmonary infection, recurrent soft tissue or organ abscesses, two or more episodes of bacterial sepsis or meningitis); persistent oral candidiasis; infection with opportunistic, unusual, or &quot;signature&quot; organisms; failure to thrive; or a family history of immunodeficiency or unexplained early deaths. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Major causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful history and physical examination can usually isolate the disorder to one of the four components of the immune system in children in whom a primary immunodeficiency (PID) is suspected. B cell and combined B and T cell abnormalities account for nearly three-fourths of the PIDs and should be considered initially. Isolated T cell, phagocytic, and complement defects are rare. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The screening evaluation should include both quantitative and qualitative tests. Screening tests may include a complete blood count with differential, chemistry studies, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), appropriate cultures, radiologic imaging of the infection site, immunoglobulin levels, antibody titers to vaccine antigens, and complement activity. Definitive diagnostic testing should be performed if the initial screening evaluation is abnormal. Definitive testing should be undertaken in consultation with a pediatric immunologist.
