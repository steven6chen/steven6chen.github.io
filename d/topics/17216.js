A general discussion of catheter-related upper extremity thrombosis is presented separately, as is a general discussion of the indications and placement of central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57459765\"><span class=\"h1\">CATHETER DYSFUNCTION AND FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The detection of catheter dysfunction is important. If not addressed, it can lead to inadequate dialysis. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines define catheter dysfunction as the inability to achieve a volumetric blood flow (Qb) &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> during the first 60 minutes of hemodialysis despite at least one attempt to improve flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, this definition is overly simplistic. In evaluating a catheter for dysfunction, there are several issues that should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159479870\"><span class=\"h2\">Measuring catheter flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, the Qb value that is recorded for the dialysis treatment is taken as the blood pump speed (based on pump revolutions per minute). However, the reading is not a true indicator of the actual blood flow to the catheter. The measurement of Qb depends on having a standardized volumetric blood pump segment of the dialysis tubing. This is the basis for two problems that can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, the pump relies on the elasticity of the pump segment to expand and refill as the rollers turn. However, despite the manufacturers' efforts to employ tubing materials with minimal elastic hysteresis (failure to return to original size on the rebound), there is some flattening of the pump segment during dialysis as the tubing becomes warmer. This results in a slight decrease in blood flow late in the dialysis treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, the relationship between prepump (arterial) pressure and Qb is curvilinear. As the prepump pressure increases, Qb decreases. There is a potential for prepump pressure to become more negative with increasing flow demands. The pump segment can be partially collapsed if the prepump pressure becomes excessive (becomes more negative). Refilling of this segment is less complete as prepump pressure increases and its reflection of true volumetric flow becomes progressively more inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In order to prevent errors caused by excessive negative pressure, it is recommended that the prepump pressure be monitored and that alarms be set to detect when it drops below -240 to -260 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p>A Qb problem likely to result in catheter dysfunction is generally progressive. To be of maximum value in detecting catheter dysfunction, Qb should be trended over time. Since the KDOQI guidelines were written, improved catheter design allows much higher Qb (&gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> to be achieved at an acceptable prepump pressure. Waiting until Qb declines to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in these catheters may be inappropriate, missing the opportunity to detect catheter dysfunction earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>It has been recommended that, for the purpose of trending, Qb (from the blood pump indicator) be measured at a standard prepump pressure (eg, -250 mmHg) at each hemodialysis session five minutes after the start of the session. A baseline Qb should be established for a newly placed catheter, and the Qb should be recorded for each treatment to detect changes. A decline of &lt;10 percent at the same negative prepump pressure may result from a variety of factors and should not cause concern, but a change of &gt;10 percent, particularly if progressive (indicating a progressive increase in resistance), should be taken as an indication of impending catheter dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159479856\"><span class=\"h2\">Indicators of catheter dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine monitoring of parameters suggesting the presence of dysfunction should be performed for all dialysis patients who are dialyzing with a dialysis access catheter. The detection of catheter dysfunction, whether early or late, is important. If not addressed, it can lead to catheter failure, which can be classified as either early or late, with differing etiologies relative to the time distinction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H159480245\" class=\"local\">'Early catheter failure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H159480287\" class=\"local\">'Late catheter failure'</a> below.)</p><p>The variables listed below have been recommended as indications of catheter dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decline in Qb of &gt;10 percent, particularly if progressive (measured at a prepump pressure of 250 mmHg five minutes after the start of the session).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A delivered <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of &lt;1.2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arterial pressure (pre-pump) more negative than -250 mmHg, or a venous pressure (post-pump) of &gt;250 mmHg. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159480245\"><span class=\"h3\">Early catheter failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early catheter failure is defined as a catheter that never functioned adequately. This may be represented as either no blood flow (Qb), intermittent flow, or a Qb insufficient to provide dialysis without significantly lengthening the hemodialysis treatment. In general, early failure is related to technical problems with placement or catheter positioning, and these ideally should have been recognized and corrected at the time of catheter placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access#H79682089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Catheter positioning'</a>.)</p><p>Technical problems include an improperly positioned catheter, kinked catheter, or a catheter that is constricted by the exit-site suture(s). If the catheter was recently exchanged for a previously malfunctioning one, placement of the new catheter into the preexisting fibrin sheath must also be considered as a possible cause. A catheter may have been placed into the wrong vessel. As an example, placement of a catheter into the azygous vein is not unusual due to the frequency of central vein stenosis thrombosis, which can lead to enlargement of the azygous vein. Malposition into the azygous should be suspected if the catheter runs obliquely toward the midline in the anteroposterior view. Catheter retraction can also lead to malposition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159480287\"><span class=\"h3\">Late catheter failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late catheter failure is defined as the inability to attain and maintain a Qb sufficient to perform hemodialysis without significantly lengthening the hemodialysis treatment in a catheter that was previously working adequately. Thrombotic occlusions, partial or total, are the major cause of late catheter dysfunction and can provide a substrate for bacterial growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. They can occur very early after insertion or after prolonged continuous successful usage. A study of 721 hemodialysis patients revealed that clot formation was one of four parameters significantly and independently related to inadequate dialysis dose delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thrombosis frequently results in catheter loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The specific factors leading to thrombosis in an individual case are seldom obvious. A definable hypercoagulable state is rarely observed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3025115223\"><span class=\"h4\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-related thrombosis can be classified according to symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic) or by location relative to the catheter as extrinsic or intrinsic. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrinsic thrombus &ndash; This term refers to a thrombus that extends outside of the catheter into the vascular structure in which it resides. Although they are described as distinct entities, there is overlap between these categories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central vein thrombus &ndash; The presence of a catheter within the central veins, most commonly the subclavian, can precipitate total thrombosis of the vessel. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Central vein thrombosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mural thrombus &ndash; Mural thrombus forms on the wall of the vein or atrium at the point of its contact with the tip of the catheter. This becomes recognized because of catheter dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Mural thrombus'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atrial thrombus &ndash; Thrombus within the right atrium, which may be attached to the wall of the atrium, or present as a mass within the atrium.

There are three types of intrinsic thrombi:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intraluminal thrombus &ndash; This term refers to a thrombus that occurs within the catheter lumen. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Intraluminal thrombus'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Catheter tip thrombus &ndash; This refers to a thrombus that develops at the tip of the catheter. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Catheter tip thrombus'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fibrin sheath thrombus &ndash; This term refers to a thrombus that develops as part of the sleeve immediately surrounding the catheter.

All forms of extrinsic thrombi can, in addition to causing catheter blood flow problems during hemodialysis, present with relatively unique clinical features that suggest the particular type of thrombus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Central vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although central vein thrombosis is more frequently seen with an acute catheter rather than with a tunneled dialysis catheter, the frequency with which any catheter within the central veins precipitates thrombosis of the vein is unclear. Some investigators have found that it is uncommon, occurring in only 2 percent in a series of 101 percutaneously inserted catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. By comparison, another study of 63 patients with central venous catheters (but not dialysis catheters) reported an incidence of 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this report, the authors evaluated the patients systematically after catheter removal. Thus, among other factors, the frequency with which central vein thrombosis is discovered is related to the frequency with which it is searched for in asymptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1097136702\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-related central vein thrombosis can affect the subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, or superior vena cava, as well as the axillary vein or jugular vein (vein often used for insertion of catheter). Although these latter two are not central veins, the clinical features are much the same. In addition, more than one venous structure can be involved. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, the appearance of a central vein thrombosis has been described as that of a &quot;thick ring&quot; surrounding the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Cases can present with or without symptoms; however, most cases are clinically asymptomatic. The presence of dilated chest wall veins, often unilateral, during an unrelated examination may be the only manifestation. The thrombus can incite an inflammatory reaction with pain and tenderness at the base of the neck, the supraclavicular fossa, and the shoulder area. Some patients initially present with sudden onset of upper extremity swelling, which can be dramatic. Edema of the arm and hand may be exercise dependent and present only when the arm is used vigorously. For some patients, extremity edema is only a subjective symptom, presenting as a feeling of fullness in the fingers or difficulty with finger rings feeling &quot;too tight.&quot; In other patients, signs and symptoms of embolization, either to the pulmonary circulation or paradoxically to the systemic arterial bed, may be the first clue; however, symptoms and signs of embolization in association with hemodialysis catheters are unusual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'No symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2003000112\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the signs and symptoms of symptomatic thrombosis are diagnostic, it may be desirable to document the diagnosis by more objective means in some cases. Venography is the most sensitive and specific technique for demonstrating central vein thrombosis, but duplex ultrasonography is preferred as the initial imaging study, because it is noninvasive, generally readily available, and inexpensive. For asymptomatic patients, duplex ultrasound has a lower sensitivity, making a negative study fairly noncontributory to patient care. Fortunately, its specificity remains quite high, and the test is easy to perform. If ultrasound is negative and clinical suspicion remains high, venography should be obtained. There is a close association between venous stenosis and thrombosis. Although most cases of stenosis are not associated with a thrombus, the reverse is not the case. Venography may be needed to definitely exclude central venous stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a prospective report that evaluated 44 patients with subclavian venous catheters, detection of catheter-related thrombosis by color Doppler ultrasound and by venography were compared in an attempt to establish a correlation between the two modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Criteria considered as showing the presence of thrombosis included visualization of thrombus (T), absence of spontaneous flow (S), absence of phasicity of flow with respiration (P), incompressibility of the vein with probe pressure (C), and visualization of increased venous collaterals (V). Analyzing each variable separately, P had the highest sensitivity (94 percent) and S had the highest specificity (100 percent). The best combinations for diagnosis were T+P, P+S, and T+P+S, which had a sensitivity of 94 percent and specificity of 88 percent. Overall, the diagnostic value of color Doppler ultrasonography alone had a sensitivity and specificity of 94 and 96 percent, respectively.</p><p>In another study of 60 upper extremities in 42 hemodialysis patients, the efficacy of color flow duplex imaging in detecting proximal upper extremity venous outflow obstruction was compared with traditional contrast venography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Five of the 60 duplex scans were nondiagnostic because of artifact from the intravenous dialysis catheter (in three patients) or incomplete visualization of the subclavian or brachiocephalic veins (in two patients). In the remaining 55 duplex scans, proximal venous outflow obstruction was identified in 18 (33 percent), compared with 21 (38 percent) by venography. Overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for color flow duplex imaging were 81, 97, 94, and 89 percent, respectively.</p><p>Subclavian vein thrombi not seen by duplex ultrasonography are usually either nonocclusive mural thrombi or thrombi located in the proximal part of the vein that is shadowed by the clavicle and sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By observing ancillary features such as flow, phasicity with respiration, and compressibility of the vein, the sensitivity of this test can be considerably enhanced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2437944986\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When symptomatic thrombosis is present (extremity swelling, thromboembolism), the catheter should be removed, if possible. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for patients (symptomatic or asymptomatic) with acute thrombosis of the axillary or more proximal veins similar to the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, provided there are no contraindications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Anticoagulation should be continued for a period of three months after catheter removal to prevent extension of the thrombus and to allow it to organize. For those who cannot be anticoagulated, catheter removal alone may be sufficient to resolve symptoms. Specific therapeutic regimens are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thromboembolism-initiation-of-anticoagulation-first-10-days\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thromboembolism: Initiation of anticoagulation (first 10 days)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thromboembolism-anticoagulation-after-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thromboembolism: Anticoagulation after initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For cases in which potential sites for vascular access are depleted or extremely limited, it may be possible to preserve the catheter. Available clinical practice guidelines suggest that a catheter (nondialysis) that is functioning and for which there is ongoing need, does not need to be removed. As discussed in the paragraph above, the patient should be systemically anticoagulated for as long as the catheter is in use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It should be kept in mind, however, that the presence of the catheter can promote the development of infection, which can lead to additional complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Functioning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mural thrombus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mural thrombus is a localized thrombus attached to the wall of a vessel at the point(s) of catheter contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. It is theorized that the surface of the vessel is damaged by constant movement of the catheter with respiration and the cardiac cycle. It has been described as having the appearance of patchy hyperintensity adhering to the vessel wall without completely occluding the vein when viewed with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Most mural thrombi are small and only recognized when the tip of the catheter becomes embedded in the thrombus, leading to catheter malfunction. Larger mural thrombi may be symptomatic due to pulmonary emboli or, if they become infected, can lead to septic embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The diagnosis can generally be made with venography performed through the catheter. For those with symptoms and signs of embolization, transesophageal echocardiography is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views#H9886539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography: Indications, complications, and normal views&quot;, section on 'Indications for TEE'</a>.)</p><p>When mural thrombus is identified and associated with catheter dysfunction, removal of the catheter is indicated, which alone represents adequate treatment for small thrombi. Patients with larger thrombi should be anticoagulated as described above for central vein thrombosis. Repeat echocardiographic studies should be performed to document resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While most mural thrombi are small (approximately &lt;2 to 3 cm), this is not always the case. In some instances, what would otherwise be classified as a mural thrombus is large and extends up into the superior vena cava. These larger thrombi present much the same complication risk as a central vein thrombosis and should be managed with systemic anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Central vein thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104428774\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter-related atrial thrombus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In spite of the large numbers of dialysis catheters that have been placed, the incidence of catheter-associated atrial thrombus (CRAT) is not known for certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. One review cited an incidence ranging from 2 to 13&nbsp;percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. However, the true incidence depends upon the definition used. Some would define a CRAT as a thrombus attached to the tip of the catheter; however, based upon a literal definition, mural thrombi that occur within the atrium should also be included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/21,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25-27</a>]. These are relatively common in association with central venous catheter usage. In an autopsy study of 940 cases, an atrial mural thrombus was seen in 24 hearts and was related to an insertion of a central venous catheter in 23 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another study involving 13 cases with a central venous catheter-associated thrombus (non-dialysis), the thrombus was attached to the tip of the catheter in seven cases but there was a mural thrombus in six [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As would be expected, there is a direct correlation between CRAT and the central venous catheter tip lying within the atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Our recommendations for treatment of CRAT are based upon indirect evidence for the treatment of venous thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], observational data regarding the management of atrial thrombus related to central catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22,24,29-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,29-41</a>], and, in particular, a systematic review of CRAT associated with dialysis catheters discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For small CRAT (&lt;1.5 cm), we suggest simple removal or exchange of the hemodialysis catheter. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with larger CRAT (&ge;1.5 cm), we recommend anticoagulation for a minimum of six months, and removal (or exchange) of the catheter.

They are found in a structurally normal right atrium and generally represent emboli in transit from deep vein thrombosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type B &ndash; Type B thrombi are attached to the atrial wall and are found in a structurally abnormal right atrium or in the presence of foreign bodies such as a catheter. CRAT is rare but the more common cause of type B thrombus.</p><p/><p>Although fatal cases have been reported, most cases of CRAT are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An echocardiographic study of 50 patients with dialysis catheters noted thrombus at the tip of the catheter in nine patients (18 percent), all of whom were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, it is unusual to perform an imaging study when a dialysis catheter is removed or exchanged. Therefore, unless the patient becomes symptomatic, CRAT is generally not suspected. </p><p>Although size may be important for determining the significance of CRAT, there are few data to suggest what the threshold size for treatment should be. Most reports focus on the management of larger CRAT causing symptoms or catheter dysfunction. One study did look at the behavior of smaller thrombi. In this study, a transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 32 patients within six to eight weeks following Hickman catheter implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A CRAT was identified in six cases, each associated with the tip of the catheter. Five of the six were elongated; the largest measured 1.4 x 0.5 cm. The sixth case had a large thrombus along the free wall of the right atrium adjacent to the catheter tip measuring 1.1 x 2.2 x 2.3 cm (this could have been classified as a mural thrombus). None of the six cases was treated, and none had any adverse sequelae. Although this is a small observational study, it suggests that small thrombi &lt;1.5 cm can be treated conservatively. However, the presence of even a small thrombus (&lt;1.5 cm) should prompt removal or an exchange of the catheter to minimize further complications (eg, thrombus infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Fortunately, larger (&gt;1.5 cm) CRAT are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Massive CRATs (&gt;6 cm) can interfere with right atrial function, causing syncope or signs of right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40</a>]. Other presentations include hemodialysis catheter dysfunction, pulmonary embolism (or paradoxical systemic embolism), endocarditis, or an incidental right atrial mass identified on cardiac imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/21,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,36,37</a>]. Pulmonary symptoms may be most common. In one study, four of five dialysis patients diagnosed with CRAT were being evaluated to determine the cause of hemoptysis or dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Patients with larger CRATs (&gt;1.5 cm) should be hospitalized at least initially. Complications are common, and anticoagulated patients are still at risk for pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Medical therapy includes systemic anticoagulation with similar considerations as with the treatment of other venous thromboembolism, and possibly antibiotic therapy if the patient has symptoms suggestive of infection. The catheter should be removed once therapeutic anticoagulation has been achieved, or at the time of thrombectomy. A logistic regression analysis in one systematic review found that maintaining the catheter was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Treatments included anticoagulation, systemic thrombolytic therapy, or surgical thrombectomy. Thrombolysis was successful in only two of eight patients in the review (ie, type B thrombus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which is in contrast with generally good effectiveness for type A atrial thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Mortality rates for 37 patients treated with anticoagulation alone and 23 patients undergoing surgical thrombectomy (including failed anticoagulation) were similar (16 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients who underwent surgical thrombectomy were younger and had significantly larger thrombus compared with those were anticoagulated (mean age: 39 versus 54; mean thrombus diameter: 35 versus 24 mm). There were no differences in outcome comparing anticoagulation with thrombectomy for patients stratified by thrombus size (above and below the median size of 28 mm or according to tertiles [&le;2.0, 2.1 to 3.2, and &ge;3.3 cm]). Six patients had a thrombus &ge;6.0 cm (maximum diameter measured). Five of them underwent thrombectomy as initial treatment, and all survived. </p><p>The duration of anticoagulant therapy is dictated by the disappearance of the thrombus. Progress and success of therapy should be monitored by echocardiography. In one study of 12 patients, CRAT resolved in one-half of the patients after six months with anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The risk of failure of medical therapy was greater for larger thrombi. </p><p>A new hemodialysis catheter can be replaced at the same or alternative site with its tip positioned in the distal inferior vena cava to provide dialysis while anticoagulation therapy is underway.

A catheter tip thrombus may be occlusive or act as a ball valve. Preventive measures that are used to avoid intraluminal thrombosis are generally adequate for the prevention of these thrombi. It is probable that forcible flushing before and after dialysis aids in clearing poorly attached catheter tip thrombi.

Thrombus associated with the fibrin sheath is the most common thrombus that forms with the chronic dialysis catheter. The reported incidence of catheter dysfunction secondary to a fibrin sheath ranges between 13 to 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Fibrin sheath formation generally causes catheter dysfunction weeks or months after catheter placement, but it has been observed as early as 48 hours post placement.</p><p>All central venous catheters likely become encased in a layer of fibrin within a few days of insertion. It starts as early as 24 hours after insertion of the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], which then becomes encased along its entire length within five to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In an autopsy study of 55 patients with central venous catheters, a fibrin sheath was found in 100 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This is not to say that all fibrin sheaths are problematic; they are not. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the vein is cannulated, the endothelium is injured and a thrombus forms around the catheter at the insertion site. This becomes organized and is eventually converted to fibroepithelial tissue. The term &quot;fibrin sheath&quot; refers to a sleeve that surrounds the intravenous portion of the catheter. Animal studies have suggested that this sheath is actually not composed entirely of fibrin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Fibrin continues to be deposited at the leading edge of this tissue and consequently becomes organized. In this manner, a sleeve of fibroepithelial tissue migrates down the catheter to form a sheath. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fibrin sheath is only loosely attached to the catheter. When a catheter is removed, angiography performed through the partially retracted catheter can demonstrate a &quot;wind sock&quot; of residual fibrin sleeve in approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Fibrin sheath formation has been reported in 40 to 76 percent of tunnelled dialysis catheters by pull-back venography at the time of catheter removal for dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although not considered part of the fibrin sheath, the fibroepithelial sleeve surrounding the catheter actually starts peripherally at the exit site, continues through the subcutaneous tunnel, and is continuous with the intravenous portion of the catheter.</p><p/><p>The question arises as to whether a fibrin sheath can lead to or contribute to the formation of a stenotic lesion within the vein. The answer to this question is not available. Histologic studies of human autopsy material of long-term catheters have shown the development of vein wall thickening and bridges from the vein wall to the fibrin sheath covering the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Whether this reaction may progress to stenosis is not known. However, these types of changes have caused some interventionalists to question whether a fibrin sheath should be ablated even if the catheter is being permanently removed to minimize the risk of later developing venous stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once recognized, intrinsic catheter malfunction should be addressed immediately. Delayed treatment results in inadequate dialysis and excessive catheter manipulation, which can lead to catheter-related bacteremia. If the problem cannot be successfully resolved within the dialysis facility or if the treatment applied does not have an effect of sufficient duration, then the case should be referred to a vascular specialist for diagnostic imaging and possible intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Appropriate treatment should then be based upon the findings of this evaluation. Catheter exchange over a guidewire can be effectively used to eliminate intrinsic catheter thrombosis and is the secondary&nbsp;treatment for intrinsic catheter thrombosis. Prior to inserting the new catheter, the presence of a fibrin sheath should be determined. If present, it should be obliterated prior to the placement of the new catheter. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Referral for intervention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1129151601\"><span class=\"h3\">In the dialysis unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment of intrinsic catheter-related thrombosis can be attempted within the hemodialysis facility and consists of, first, a forceful saline flush and, if not successful, intraluminal lytic enzyme instillation. These treatments can be tried before an absolute diagnosis (ie, extrinsic versus intrinsic thrombosis) is established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Forceful saline flush</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A forceful flush should be the <strong>first</strong> approach to treatment of a malfunctioning catheter that has previously functioned adequately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. To minimize the chance of catheter rupture, the syringe should not be smaller than 5 mL; a 10-mL syringe is optimal. The force that can be generated with a syringe is inversely proportional to the diameter of the syringe (it is actually related to the ratio of the diameter of the plunger to that of the syringe outlet opening). Thus, a small (but not too small) syringe should be used, and it should possess a Luer lock so that it will not become detached during the procedure.</p><p>The syringe should be filled with saline, attached firmly to the catheter, and flushed into the catheter with as much force as can be generated with the hand. Once done, an attempt to aspirate blood should be made. If no blood can be aspirated, the saline flush can be repeated several times. If blood can be aspirated, the procedure should be repeated multiple times using blood until flow seems to be free and easy.</p><p>The saline flush technique has the advantages of being easily performed, economical, safe, and frequently effective. Although a successful saline flush means that the thrombus that occluded the catheter has embolized, this does not clinically appear to be a problem since the thrombus is very small. Thrombi of this type and size are frequently embolized in catheter-dialyzed patients without being recognized.</p><p>The disadvantages of this procedure are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It may not be successful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not a permanent solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a small risk of rupturing the catheter. However, if the catheter does rupture, it is not a major problem. An intravascular rupture will not be obvious, although the catheter will continue to be dysfunctional. An extravascular rupture should be clamped central to the rupture point until the catheter can be replaced</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Intraluminal lytic enzyme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If flushing is ineffective, the instillation of intraluminal lytic enzyme (eg, tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]), which is then allowed to dwell within the catheter for a prescribed period, has been extremely useful for managing catheter dysfunction within the dialysis facility. In the past, urokinase was used as the agent of choice for this purpose and was reasonably effective. However, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has replaced urokinase for this purpose and has been shown to be significantly more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/52-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-59</a>]. By comparison, the value of intraluminal lytic enzyme infusion is questionable, and it is not recommended.</p><p>Studies of catheter instillation with 1 (single treatment) to 2 mg (second treatment with another 1 mg) of tPA per lumen have reported short-term success in 83 to 98 percent of uses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/56,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,60</a>]. As an example, in a study of 995 patients with occluded single- (26 percent), double- (39 percent), or triple- (6 percent) lumen catheters or ports (29 percent) treated with tPA, flow was successfully restored in 52 percent and 78 percent of catheters at 30 and 120 minutes after one dose, and 84 percent and 87 percent at 30 and 120 minutes after a second dose, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Restoration of flow was 86, 93, 90, and 79 percent for single-, double-, and triple-lumen catheters and ports, respectively. Estimated 30-day catheter patency was 74 percent. No complications were encountered. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenecteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tenecteplase</a>, another thrombolytic agent, also significantly improves hemodialysis catheter function after intraluminal instillation. Tenecteplase has a longer half-life than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (20 versus 5 minutes), which could be an advantage in treating a thrombosed catheter. It also has increased specificity for fibrin and increased resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a protein that can interfere with clot-dissolving effects of both naturally occurring and recombinant tPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a study of 149 patients with dysfunctional catheters who were randomly assigned to receive a one-hour intracatheter dwell with tenecteplase (2 mg) or placebo, active therapy was associated with significant increases in percentage of functional catheters (22 versus 5 percent) and mean change in blood flow rates (47 versus 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Tenecteplase was well tolerated. </p><p>In general, the effect of instilled tPA can be expected to be of only short-term benefit, since the enzyme is only effective within the lumen and at the tip. It therefore does not come into contact with nor affect the bulk of the fibrin sheath, the most common cause of intrinsic catheter malfunction.</p><p>Of critical importance is the primary patency of catheters following tPA treatment for dysfunction. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study involving only hemodialysis catheters, 85 episodes of catheter dysfunction were treated using tPA (Retavase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The overall mean duration of catheter patency was 45&plusmn;39 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of only hemodialysis catheters, all uses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> in the setting of inadequate catheter blood flow in a cohort of 570 catheters over a 2.5-year period were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Alteplase instillation was necessary in 2.77 percent of dialysis sessions. The median time from the first to second treatment or catheter removal for nonfunction or thrombosis was 27 days (95% CI 15.7-32.3). Additional median survival advantage gained from each subsequent treatment ranged from 10 to 18 days. In other words, treatment of recurrent catheter malfunction with alteplase allowed for a median of only five to seven additional dialysis sessions before the treatment had to be repeated or the catheter exchanged. These authors suggested that the ultimate clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of tPA treatment was doubtful because of the duration of the effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized controlled study, 60 hemodialysis patients with catheter dysfunction (defined as &lt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> blood flow) were studied to compare the effects of short versus long dwell times for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> in restoring catheter function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1-hour or &gt;48 hours (until subsequent dialysis treatment) dwell times. After alteplase installation, a 78 percent overall catheter patency rate was observed at the subsequent dialysis treatment, falling to 48 percent patency at two weeks. There was no statistically significant difference between the short and long dwell groups for catheter patency at the subsequent dialysis treatment (76.9 versus 79.4 percent) or at two weeks (42.3 versus 52.9 percent). Basically, alteplase installation achieved a median catheter function time of only 14 days. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that catheter treatment on two or more previous occasions was a predictor of failure both at the subsequent dialysis treatment and at two weeks. These investigators concluded that neither short nor long dwell times for alteplase were reliable in terms of long-term patency. Use of this agent should be viewed as a means of providing a two-week window during which time more definitive therapy should be sought.</p><p/><p>For practical reasons, it does seem that every dialysis facility should have a protocol in place for the use of tPA to manage dysfunctional dialysis catheters. Such therapy can be accomplished with minimal disruption to the patient's dialysis schedule, which has value.</p><p>However, the question as to how many times tPA should be used before the case is referred for a catheter exchange or whether it should be used at all is one that can be answered only in relationship to the circumstances of a given dialysis facility and the individual patient. The critical points are the patient's need for dialysis on a timely basis and the risks of excessive catheter manipulation. A catheter that is not able to provide the blood flow necessary for adequate dialysis according to the patient's prescription must not be tolerated. All catheter flow problems must be resolved in a timely fashion, and the emphasis for managing catheter dysfunction should shift to intervention at a relatively early stage of dysfunction.</p><p>Reasonable guidelines are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If lytic therapy fails to restore blood flow to a level that will provide for adequate dialysis according to the patient's prescription, the catheter should be exchanged. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the duration of the effectiveness of lytic therapy is less than two weeks, serious consideration should be given to exchanging the catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h4\">Infusion of lytic enzyme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of catheter thrombosis with transcatheter urokinase, either as an infusion off of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/9,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,53</a>] or an infusion during dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], has been used in the past with good success. Tissue plasminogen activator has been used in a similar manner. Although in published reports this type of therapy has been performed at a referral facility, there is no reason that it could not be accomplished in the dialysis clinic. However, the result obtained with this form of enzyme therapy is no better than that obtained with intraluminal enzyme; in addition, it is more difficult and more expensive to accomplish. Its value is questionable, and it is <strong>not recommended</strong>.</p><p>In one series, 55 cases of hemodialysis catheter malfunction felt to be related to fibrin sheath development were treated with tPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. An infusion of 2.5 mg of tPA in 50 mL of normal saline was given as a three-hour infusion though each port. The technical success rate, defined as at least one successful dialysis session, was 91 percent. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis yielded primary patency rates at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of 0.55, 0.36, 0.25, and 0.15, respectively. The dose of enzyme used was not large enough to result in systemic effects, and no complications were encountered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Referral for intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the problem cannot be successfully resolved within the dialysis facility or if the treatment applied does not have an effect of sufficient duration, then the patient should be referred to a vascular specialist for diagnostic evaluation. Appropriate treatment should then be based upon the findings of this evaluation. Treatment of extrinsic thrombus is discussed above.

Forty-seven long-term hemodialysis patients with secondary, refractory catheter dysfunction underwent guidewire exchange to replace their catheters. Sheaths were present in 33 (70 percent) of the 47 patients. In 18 patients who were randomly assigned to disruption, the median time to repeat dysfunction was 373 days, compared with 97.5 days in patients who did not undergo disruption (p = 0.22), and the median time to repeat catheter exchange was 411 and 198 days, respectively (p = 0.17). Fourteen patients had no sheaths, and their median times to repeat dysfunction and repeat exchange were 849 and 879 days, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p>Replacing the catheter can be performed using a technique that preserves both the exit and venotomy sites. Over-the-guidewire exchange of tunneled hemodialysis catheters is safe and easily accomplished. It causes no increase in infectious complications and provides similar catheter longevity to de novo catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>In one study, for example, 42 catheters were placed through the preexisting subcutaneous tunnels of failing catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Technical success for catheter exchange was 93 percent. Infection rates were comparable to those of de novo catheter placement: 0.15 and 0.11 infections per 100 catheter-days for de novo and exchanged catheters, respectively. Catheter duration of function was not significantly different for de novo and exchanged catheters: 63 and 51 percent at three months, 51 and 37 percent at six months, and 35 and 30 percent at 12 months, respectively.</p><p>Catheter exchange is also an effective means of prolonging catheter patency in patients with end-stage renal disease and limited central venous access sites. This was illustrated in a study that evaluated the outcomes of 51 consecutive patients who underwent 88 catheter exchanges because of poor flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Catheter exchanges were performed through the existing subcutaneous tract over a guidewire. Life table analysis was performed to evaluate catheter patency rates after initial placement (primary patency) and after multiple exchanges (secondary patency). The technical success rate for hemodialysis catheter exchange was 100 percent. Primary catheter patency was 42 and 16 percent at 60 and 120 days, respectively, while secondary patency was 92 and 82 percent at 60 and 120 days, respectively. The cumulative infection rate was 1.1 per 1000 catheter-days. In the above study utilizing this technique, there was a cumulative infection rate of only 1.1 per 1000 catheter-days and no reported bleeding.</p><p>Advantages to catheter exchange are that the procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preserves the exit and venotomy site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is safe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is less expensive than fibrin sheath stripping (see below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a high rate of success</p><p/><p>Most interventionalists choose to look for and disrupt a fibrin sheath when doing the catheter exchange, although there is little evidence to support this practice and some believe it is of little value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/69,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,72</a>]. In one study, 47 long-term hemodialysis patients with refractory catheter dysfunction underwent guidewire catheter exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. A fibrin sheath was present in 33 (70 percent) of the 47 cases. The cohort was divided into three groups: no sheath, sheath disruption, and sheath with no disruption. The latter two groups were randomized. Although disrupting fibrin sheaths increased durable catheter patency, the difference compared with those who did not have disruption was not significant. However, the sheath disruption group had a higher mean blood flow of 340 versus 329 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and a higher clearance compared with the sheath no disruption group (72 versus 66 percent). There were also trends for a lower frequency of dialysis treatments with a urea reduction ratio (URR) &lt;65 percent (16 versus 27 percent) and need for thrombolytic after disruption (2.1 versus 5.0 percent).</p><p>When chosen, disrupting the fibrin sheath can be accomplished by using several different devices; however, the most frequently used technique involves the use of an angioplasty balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/49,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,73,74</a>]. The size of the balloon used has varied from 8 to 12 mm in diameter. By using an angioplasty balloon, it is possible to not only disrupt the fibrin sheath but also dilate any associated venous stenosis.</p><p>When the fibrin sheath is left behind, even if disrupted, the question as to what becomes of this material once the catheter is removed has been raised. In an early study that involved catheters that have been in place for a relatively short period of time (mean of 27 days, range of 3 to 111 days), it was found that while the fibrin sheath was adherent to the vessel wall in most cases, in a few cases it was observed to embolize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In 3 of 60 cases, the patients were symptomatic and lung scans confirmed the occurrence of a polar embolus. In another series of 25 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] in which the temporary dialysis catheter had also been in place for only a short period (mean of 29 days, range of 12 to 48 days), fibrin sheath embolization did not occur in any patient.
