Similar trends are apparent throughout the developed world. The increase in the number of older adults has been accompanied by an increase in the use of health care, including the emergency department (ED), by patients with significant comorbid conditions such as diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer.</p><p>Many older patients with comorbid disease will require airway management during the course of their illness.

Among the most important are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung parenchymal changes resulting in impaired gas exchange and reduced PaO<sub>2</sub></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased lung elasticity and increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased chest wall compliance and respiratory muscle strength, leading to increased work of breathing and higher risk of respiratory failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced cough and mucociliary clearance, and possibly neuromuscular deconditioning, increasing the risk from aspiration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced responsiveness of brain respiratory centers to hypoxemia and hypercarbia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished overall cardiopulmonary reserve (and possibly coronary artery disease), resulting in heightened sensitivity to the negative inotropy and vasodilatory effects of induction agents and other vasoactive drugs, potentially causing cardiovascular collapse (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to distinguish between changes due to the physiology of aging and pathologic changes brought on by chronic disease. Despite the contributory role played by the physiologic factors described above, data suggest that comorbid conditions, and <strong>not</strong> age, play the most important role in determining patient outcome after respiratory failure in elders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As an example, a vigorous octogenarian who exercises daily has far more physiologic reserve and will tolerate the stress of acute illness far better than her bed-bound counterpart with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Nevertheless, chronic illness and disability are more common in elders. Exacerbations of chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases often exhaust the patient's limited cardiopulmonary reserve, leading to respiratory distress or failure and the need for intubation. Such patients may not tolerate the greater work of breathing, leading to respiratory failure much earlier than in their healthier or younger counterparts. In addition, acquired illnesses, such as community or hospital acquired pneumonia or urinary tract infection, can progress to sepsis and rapidly deplete physiologic reserves in susceptible geriatric patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of heart failure&quot;, section on 'Older adults'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethical considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians providing emergency or critical care to elders must consider patient wishes. When appropriate, clinicians should enquire regarding the presence of advanced directives (code status) and attempt to determine patient desires regarding invasive measures such as intubation by review of existing documentation or discussion with the patient, the patient's family, or the primary care physician.</p><p>&quot;Do not intubate&quot; and &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; status must not be assumed, and patient age alone is never an indication to withhold care in the context of an acute illness. Studies suggest that clinicians caring for elders at the end of life often underestimate the level of resuscitation desired by the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>When the clinician managing the patient with acute deterioration is not able to determine the patient's wishes or code status, it generally is best to proceed with resuscitation and intubation, and to end life-sustaining treatment later should information about advanced directives become available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">AIRWAY DIFFICULTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both bag-mask ventilation and intubation are more likely to be difficult in elders. The assessment and general approach to the difficult airway in adults is discussed separately; issues of particular relevance to geriatric patients are discussed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Elder, edentulous patients are harder to ventilate with a bag-valve mask and less tolerant of hypoxia. The loss of upper airway muscle tone and loose lips unsupported by teeth make mask seal and maintenance of a patent airway more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A stiffer chest wall also increases the difficulty of ventilation with a bag-valve mask or a rescue airway (eg, laryngeal mask airway).</p><p>Baseline oxygen saturation is often low in the elderly, and adequate preoxygenation may be difficult to achieve. In addition, elders desaturate more rapidly than healthy, younger patients. In the following figure, the curve for chronically ill patients can be used to approximate desaturation for elders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56716 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, the safe apnea period is decreased despite best attempts at preoxygenation compared with routine intubations in younger, healthy adults. Strategies for maximizing preoxygenation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Preoxygenation'</a>.)</p><p>Elder patients are more susceptible to hypoxic insults. Even brief periods of oxygen desaturation can result in permanent cardiac and neurologic damage. Whenever possible, the airway manager should maintain the oxyhemoglobin saturation at or above 90 percent, even if this requires aborting an attempt at laryngoscopy in order to oxygenate by bag and mask or with an extraglottic device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;, section on 'Bag-mask ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extraglottic-devices-for-emergency-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extraglottic devices for emergency airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When a difficult airway assessment indicates that the patient is unlikely to be successfully intubated by direct laryngoscopy, and alternative video devices are not available, we suggest using an awake approach to intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Awake technique'</a>.)</p><p>Video laryngoscopes improve both glottic exposure and intubation success and may allow safe rapid sequence intubation in patients for whom direct laryngoscopy with a conventional laryngoscope is not likely to be successful.

When performing RSI, drug selection and drug dosing are of great importance. The medications used for RSI cause more pronounced hypopnea and hypotension in the elderly than in younger, healthy patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Age has been associated with an increased risk of peri-intubation hypotension and cardiac arrest in emergency patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Therefore, it is generally best to reduce the doses of induction agents by approximately 30 to 50 percent (and the doses of any short-acting opioids used for pretreatment). Standard dosing is used for neuromuscular blocking agents.</p><p>The general performance of RSI and the medications used in the procedure are discussed separately. Issues of particular importance to RSI in elder patients are reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-blocking-agents-nmbas-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-medications-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment medications for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic optimization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The same factors that increase the potential need for airway management often predispose elderly patients to hemodynamic instability before, during, and after intubation. Whenever time allows, the clinician should intervene to optimize the cardiopulmonary status of elder patients at risk for circulatory collapse. Such risk stems from a combination of poor cardiac reserve, pathophysiology of active disease (eg, sepsis, dehydration, hemorrhage), effects of the induction agent, positive pressure ventilation, and other factors. Boluses of intravenous fluid, blood transfusion, and vasopressor agents are examples of interventions that may be needed prior to drug administration, if time permits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a before and after trial of patients intubated urgently in an ICU, rates of cardiac arrest and refractory shock were significantly lower after the implementation of a shock-sensitive protocol for airway management that focused on providing IV fluids, selecting induction agents that promote hemodynamic stability, and early use of vasopressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> is the preferred induction agent for elderly patients undergoing RSI. Etomidate is a sedative-hypnotic medication that maintains hemodynamic stability and has a rapid and reliable onset of action and a short duration of effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-the-geriatric-patient/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Hemodynamic stability is of particular importance in geriatric patients, who are at risk of large fluctuations in blood pressure from potent sedatives. The pharmacology and use of etomidate is discussed separately.

However, ketamine can cause cardiovascular collapse in patients with profound refractory shock or in a catecholamine-depleted state. In addition, ketamine can aggravate tachycardia and increase myocardial demand and so should be used judiciously if at all in elder patients with a tachydysrhythmia or advanced coronary disease.

Nevertheless, we believe the risks associated with poor intubating conditions and failed intubation attempts from incomplete paralysis outweigh any potential risk of prolonged paralysis. Therefore, pending further studies, we suggest using standard dosing for NMBAs when intubating elderly patients.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Succinylcholine</a>, in its usual dose of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of actual body weight, is the drug of choice for RSI in elders, unless contraindications are present.
