Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (considered here as psoriasis involving more than 5 to 10 percent of the body surface area) usually require an alternative approach to therapy.

For example, the safety of a potentially hepatotoxic drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, is a concern when treating patients with hepatitic disorders. In addition, the potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy on patients with chronic infections or malignancies must be considered.</p><p>The determination of the optimal approach to the treatment of psoriasis in patients with comorbidities, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV infection, latent tuberculosis, and malignancy is hampered by limited data on the safety of these treatments in the psoriasis population. As a result, proposed guidelines for the management of these patients have been based upon a combination of published data from patients with psoriasis, data from studies of similar treatment regimens for other diseases, and expert consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9475340\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC HEPATITIS B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most common chronic viral infections in humans, affecting more than 350 million people worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

In patients with chronic HBV infection, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and IgG hepatitis B core antibodies (IgG anti-HBc) persist in serum. Hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg), a marker of viral replication and infectivity that is usually associated with high levels of HBV DNA in serum and active liver disease, also may be detected. Upon recovery from HBV infection, HBsAg is no longer detectable in serum. However, patients with prior infection remain positive for IgG anti-HBc.

Although the risk for reactivation of HBV infection due to phototherapy has not been evaluated, the systemic effects of treatment are likely minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Although two one-year studies of patients without hepatitis failed to find statistically significant histological differences in pre-PUVA and post-PUVA liver biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], there have been several reports of liver injury after PUVA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].

Thus, reactivation of HBV infection is the major concern for use of these drugs in this population. </p><p>Reactivation of HBV infection in patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors may be related to a suppressive role of endogenous TNF-alpha on replication of HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Isolated cases of reactivation of HBV infection in HBsAg-positive patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors for psoriasis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Antiviral prophylaxis was given to only one patient; reactivation of HBV infection did not occur in this patient. </p><p>As a result of the paucity of treatment data in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and hepatitis B, much of the knowledge of the use of these agents in the setting of HBV infection stems from literature published in patients with conditions other than psoriasis. Most reported cases of HBV reactivation have occurred in patients who were taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> for rheumatologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], suggesting that infliximab may be the TNF-alpha inhibitor that is most likely to cause HBV reactivation. It is unclear whether the disproportionate number of reports for infliximab compared with other TNF-alpha inhibitors is related to its longer half-life or greater drug potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-selection-for-moderate-to-severe-plaque-psoriasis-in-special-populations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503282\"><span class=\"h3\">Ustekinumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are scarce on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a> and HBV infection.

Recommendations for the management of these patients are based upon data from patients with psoriasis, patients with other disorders treated with similar therapies, and expert opinion.
