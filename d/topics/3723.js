It can result from congenital defects in the membrane transport systems of the small intestinal epithelium or from acquired defects in the epithelial absorptive surface. Another factor that can interfere with nutrient absorption is maldigestion, which is due to impaired digestion of nutrients within the intestinal lumen or at the terminal digestive site of the brush border membrane of mucosal epithelial cells.</p><p>Although malabsorption and maldigestion are pathophysiologically different, the processes underlying digestion and absorption are interdependent. As a result, in clinical practice the term malabsorption has come to denote derangements in both processes.</p><p>Three steps are required for normal nutrient absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luminal and brush border processing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absorption into the intestinal mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport into the circulation</p><p/><p>Malabsorption can result from defects in each of these three phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, one or more mechanisms may exist concurrently. Thus, while the clinical sequelae may be similar for two causes of malabsorption, the underlying pathophysiology and treatment may be very different.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology of malabsorption and the individual disorders causing malabsorption (eg, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, lactase deficiency) and an overview of the treatment of malabsorption are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of nutrient absorption and malabsorption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline for chronic diarrhea (including a discussion on malabsorption) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], as well as other AGA guidelines, can be accessed through the <a href=\"http://www.gastro.org/guidelines&amp;token=vopbpe5EOafFTZeXuZ3m7EFROevl8uLSdXNUKt1FAxBdry9G4g4i2pMMCvxwMfBX&amp;TOPIC_ID=4780\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AGA website</a>. An approach to patients with suspected malabsorption was also proposed in a guideline issued by the <a href=\"http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines&amp;token=c4GCle5rMMkc1WFQ6AWOMqUYESSJ/qUWyeyM8jC/QmJYf4WYNU0Hpx0UKKevEZ63usWj76VS84l4r0YY575mMa8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4780\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Gastroenterology Organisation</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of malabsorption depend upon the cause and severity of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 2</a>). Malabsorption may either be global or partial (isolated).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Global malabsorption results from diseases associated with either diffuse mucosal involvement or a reduced absorptive surface. An example is celiac disease in which diffuse mucosal disease can lead to impaired absorption of almost all nutrients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The classic manifestations of global malabsorption are diarrhea with pale, greasy, voluminous, foul-smelling stools and weight loss despite adequate food intake. However, this spectrum of findings is relatively uncommon, even with generalized mucosal disease. The majority of patients have relatively mild gastrointestinal symptoms, which often mimic more common disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. In some cases, anorexia, flatulence, abdominal distension and borborygmi may be the only complaints suggesting malabsorption; other patients may be asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations related to a specific micronutrient deficiency can predominate in some patients. As an example, iron deficiency anemia or osteopenia may be the only clue to the presence of celiac disease in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial or isolated malabsorption results from diseases that interfere with the absorption of specific nutrients. Defective cobalamin absorption, for example, can be seen in patients with pernicious anemia or those with disease (or resection) of the terminal ileum such as patients with Crohn disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated forms of malabsorption may present solely with symptoms that are attributable to the particular nutrient in question (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53852 \">table 3</a>). Thus, the only evidence of malabsorption may be a low serum concentration of vitamin B12 in patients who have pernicious anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of malabsorption can often be obtained from a detailed patient history, which can also exclude other causes of symptoms. As an example, a history of intestinal resection or chronic pancreatitis may suggest the diagnosis in patients with characteristic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59713 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p>Because symptoms may be absent or mimic other diseases, a routine battery of blood tests is often helpful as an initial step when malabsorption is suspected. Blood tests alone cannot establish a diagnosis of malabsorption but can provide supportive evidence. Furthermore, deficiencies of specific nutrients and vitamins may point towards the underlying cause and its duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Several invasive and noninvasive tests are available to establish the cause of malabsorption. The malabsorption of fat is the most commonly used indicator of global malabsorption for two reasons: (1) among the macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates, and protein), the process by which fat is absorbed is the most complex and, therefore, it tends to be the most sensitive to interference from disease processes; and (2) it is the most calorically dense macronutrient and, therefore, its malabsorption is a critical factor in the weight loss that often accompanies malabsorptive disorders. If the history suggests a particular cause, testing can be directed to confirm the diagnosis. Further testing may not be necessary in patients who have gross steatorrhea (increased fecal fat excretion) with an obvious cause (such as cystic fibrosis or short bowel syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The order of testing and choice of a particular test should be individualized while considering the availability and expertise needed for specialized testing. While many tests are established as gold standards for the diagnosis of particular forms of malabsorption, new tests continue to be developed and their diagnostic characteristics remain uncertain.</p><p>Thus, optimal strategies for diagnosis are still evolving. An approach to patients with suspected malabsorption was proposed in a guideline issued by the <a href=\"http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines&amp;token=c4GCle5rMMkc1WFQ6AWOMqUYESSJ/qUWyeyM8jC/QmJYf4WYNU0Hpx0UKKevEZ63usWj76VS84l4r0YY575mMa8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4780\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Gastroenterology Organisation</a>. Our general approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain an assessment of stool fat. As a general rule, we begin with a qualitative assessment of fecal fat on a single specimen since it is easier to perform. We proceed with a quantitative assessment of a 72 hour stool collection on a 100 gram <span class=\"nowrap\">fat/day</span> diet if the qualitative is negative and clinical suspicion remains high. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Fecal fat determination'</a> below.). In those with increased fecal fat, we proceed with serologic testing for celiac disease and fecal elastase determination to exclude maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We also obtain an abdominal ultrasound, which can help in identifying intestinal wall thickening (such as in Crohn disease) or dilation of jejunal loops (such as in celiac disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transabdominal-ultrasonography-of-the-small-and-large-intestine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transabdominal ultrasonography of the small and large intestine&quot;</a>.). Abdominal ultrasonography of the small and large intestine is not used commonly in the United States where a small bowel follow-through, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance enterography, or endoscopy tends to be preferred as the initial imaging modality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform a colonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum. A sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient in younger patients (&lt;45) since the yield is similar to colonoscopy (except if Crohn disease is suspected). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain additional testing if a specific cause is obtained on the history or physical examination. By contrast, further testing may not be needed in patients who have gross steatorrhea with an obvious cause (such as cystic fibrosis or short bowel syndrome). Nevertheless, when evaluating diarrhea in short bowel syndrome, it is particularly important to perform sufficient diagnostic tests to distinguish between diarrhea arising from fat malabsorption (steatorrhea) and diarrhea arising from the malabsorption of bile acids (cholorrhea), since the management of these two conditions is diametrically opposite in many respects.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, evaluation of malabsorption begins with endoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopy and pancreatic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gross morphologic appearance on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may suggest the presence of malabsorption but an intestinal biopsy provides the essential diagnostic information. A cobblestone appearance of the duodenal mucosa is seen in Crohn disease, while reduced duodenal folds and scalloping of the mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65969 \">picture 1</a>) may be evident in celiac disease. The unusual finding of multiple jejunal ulcers may indicate the presence of jejunoileitis or lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Use of vital dyes may be helpful in evaluating patients with celiac disease with partial villous atrophy since the abnormalities can be patchy and the duodenum may appear normal during standard endoscopy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indigo carmine</a> dye spraying is more accurate for identifying patients with partial atrophy than standard endoscopy (91 versus 9 percent in one series), and is also useful for directing biopsies in patients with patchy villous atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromoendoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromoendoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Small bowel biopsy is safe and can help establish the diagnosis. Tissue should be obtained distal to the ampulla of Vater using biopsy forceps passed through a gastroduodenoscope or enteroscope. Obtaining four biopsies at different sites optimizes the likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Imaging of the pancreas by CT, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and may be critical for distinguishing benign from malignant causes. Sequential dilation and sacculation of the pancreatic duct are pathognomonic of chronic pancreatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62322\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62322 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.). ERCP may permit therapeutic options in patients with chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, a normal ERCP does not exclude the presence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Direct pancreatic intubation tests, such as the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulation test, still constitute the most sensitive means of diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency in centers in which it is performed accurately (sensitivity and specificity of approximately 80 to 90 percent). The test involves intubation of the duodenum and the collection of pancreatic juices after intravenous secretin injection. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Tests for pancreatic insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Barium studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through or enteroclysis (a double contrast study performed by passing a tube into the proximal small bowel and injecting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>) can provide important information about the gross morphology of the small intestine. As an example, identification of small bowel diverticula and other anatomic abnormalities associated with bacterial overgrowth is best achieved with barium studies. Barium studies can also identify mucosal diseases that are not easily accessible by endoscopy. Although it is generally accepted that the radiologic findings in malabsorption are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], barium studies can be effective at identifying the disease process responsible for the malabsorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Wireless capsule endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wireless capsule endoscopy allows for visualization of the entire small bowel and allows for much more detailed evaluation of small bowel mucosal disease than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> studies. Thus, it may have a role in evaluating suspected small bowel disease (such as Crohn disease) associated with malabsorption. Because of the risk of retention, wireless capsule endoscopy should generally be avoided in patients with known or suspected small bowel strictures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wireless-video-capsule-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wireless video capsule endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS FOR FAT MALABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of tests can be used to detect fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). Currently, the gold standard for diagnosis of steatorrhea is quantitative measurement of stool fat via a traditional biochemical assay. Alternative methods of quantitating excess fat in the stool exist, such as near-infrared reflectance analysis and the acid steatocrit. The near-infrared analysis is the most accurate: its concordance with the biochemical method generally has a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.85-0.90 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fecal fat determination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In healthy people, daily fecal fat excretion is less than 6 g and remains constant even if fat consumption is increased to 100 to 125 g of <span class=\"nowrap\">fat/day</span>. However, fecal fat excretion can be moderately increased in diarrheal diseases even without fat malabsorption. Values of up to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> have been reported in volunteers in whom diarrhea was intentionally induced with laxatives and in patients with a stool weight of greater than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, a modest increase in fecal fat excretion in a patient with diarrhea does not necessarily indicate malabsorption as the primary cause and other tests should be performed to identify the cause of the diarrhea.</p><p>A three- to five-day collection is ideal because it reduces errors and variability that may occur if a shorter collection period is used. A longer collection period also allows the estimation of daily stool weight, which is usually greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in patients with steatorrhea. Patients should consume 70 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of dietary fat for accurate determination (normal older adult patients may have excessive stool fat if they ingest more than 140 g fat per day). They should be instructed to avoid nonabsorbable fat substitutes, such as olestra, which can lead to false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. More than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of fat in stool is pathologic, although patients with steatorrhea usually have more than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. The test is unlikely to be accurate if less than 60 grams of fat are consumed each day.</p><p>Keeping a record of all dietary intake beginning the day before, and extending for the remainder of the stool collection, improves the interpretation of the test. Average daily fat intake can then be easily determined, from which the percent of fat absorbed (&quot;fractional fat absorption&quot;) can be calculated: &gt;94 percent is normal. Fractional fat absorption is equal to (fat intake minus fat output) divided by fat intake. This is a more precise way of interpreting the test. Importantly, quantitative fecal fat determination does not discriminate between causes of steatorrhea, as there may be considerable overlap in values.</p><p>A number of other tests that can be performed more easily and more quickly than a 72-hour fecal fat determination have been evaluated for the diagnosis of malabsorption. None has yet replaced the 72-hour collection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sudan III stain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because a 72-hour stool collection is cumbersome, qualitative tests such as the Sudan III stain continue to be used in the clinic. If properly performed, a Sudan stain on a spot sample of stool can detect more than 90 percent of patients with clinically significant steatorrhea. One group suggested that counting and measuring the size of fat globules present in stool improved the accuracy of the assay while allowing for quantitative evaluation of the data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nevertheless, variability in the performance and interpretation of the test limit its overall sensitivity and reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. &quot;Neutral&quot; versus &quot;split&quot; fecal fat can be determined after the stool samples are stained with Sudan III before and after acidification and heating: neutral fat will be stained under basal conditions, and split fat will stain after acidification and heating. Such a distinction, however, is not a valid method of distinguishing maldigestion versus malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Near infrared reflectance analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A novel method, near infrared reflectance analysis (NIRA) may become the procedure of choice for evaluating fat malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,15</a>]. NIRA is equally accurate but less time-consuming than a 72-hour fecal fat collection, and allows for simultaneous measurement of fecal fat, nitrogen, and carbohydrates in a single sample. NIRA is being increasingly used in Europe and is also available in some centers in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Acid steatocrit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acid steatocrit (a gravimetric assay performed on a spot stool sample) may provide an accurate and simplified method for detecting steatorrhea on a spot stool specimen. A study evaluating this technique found a sensitivity of 100 percent, specificity of 95 percent and positive predictive value of 90 percent compared to a 72-hour fecal fat collection as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTS FOR CARBOHYDRATE MALABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a general rule, tests for carbohydrate malabsorption rely upon the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by intestinal bacteria, or direct measurement of the absorption of specific nutrients after a test dose. Examples are the lactose tolerance test as well as several breath tests, which measure hydrogen or radioactive isotopes from sugars containing radionuclide carbon analogues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">D-xylose test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The D-xylose test measures the absorptive capacity of the proximal small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and is used to determine whether defects in the intestinal epithelium are responsible for malabsorption. D-xylose is a pentose monosaccharide that can be absorbed both by an active sodium transporter and by passive diffusion. The dose used in testing is generally able to be absorbed by passive diffusion. Thus, the test is a measure of the permeability of the proximal small intestine, rather than a specific defect in D-xylose absorption.</p><p>Following an overnight fast, the patient ingests a 25 g dose of D-xylose, and urine is collected for the next five hours. A venous blood sample is also collected after one hour. Normal excretion of D-xylose is 6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 1.5 g (the lower limit of normal in individuals &gt;65 is 3.5 g). Excretion of lesser amounts of D-xylose or a serum D-xylose concentration less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> suggests abnormal absorption. Of note, some laboratories have instead established a normal range for a two- or three-hour rather than a one-hour value. Low blood levels and urinary excretion suggests mucosal disease such as celiac sprue. Absorption is usually normal in pancreatic insufficiency since pancreatic enzymes are not required for xylose absorption.</p><p>Although it remains a useful test, one should remain mindful that several conditions may lead to false positive results. The presence of renal dysfunction or an inadequate urine sample is associated with falsely depressed urinary values of D-xylose although serum values should still be normal. This may occur in some older patients (those older than 65) due to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate associated with aging. False positive results can also be seen with impaired gastric emptying, ascites, urinary retention, or fermentation of D-xylose by intestinal bacteria in patients with bacterial overgrowth. In addition, drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> diminish urinary excretion of D-xylose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Lactose tolerance test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lactose tolerance test can easily diagnose lactose intolerance. Following oral administration of a 50 g test dose, blood glucose levels are monitored at 0, 60, and 120 minutes. An increase in blood glucose by less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> plus the development of symptoms is diagnostic. False negative results can occur in patients with diabetes or bacterial overgrowth. Abnormal gastric emptying may also lead to spurious results as blood glucose may be relatively higher with rapid and artificially depressed with delayed gastric emptying.</p><p>Another form of the test is measurement of breath hydrogen following lactose challenge. An increase in breath hydrogen by more than 20 ppm is diagnostic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Breath tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breath tests using H2 or (13)CO2 can be used to diagnose specific forms of carbohydrate malabsorption (eg, lactose, fructose, sucrose isomaltase and others). Combined with serial determinations of D-xylose absorption, these tests can also monitor patients during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. A discrepancy between hydrogen and 13C-lactose breath tests may be seen in as many of one-third of patients because the excretion of 13CO2 can be influenced by colonic gas production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A combined <span class=\"nowrap\">H2/13CO2</span> lactose breath test may be more sensitive than either of these tests alone. Measurement of breath methane may enhance the accuracy of breath hydrogen testing, but has not reached broad use in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. All of these breath tests rely on bacterial fermentation of nonabsorbed carbohydrate and therefore concurrent antibiotic administration often alters the results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTEIN MALABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine testing for protein malabsorption is generally not performed in the clinic setting. The tests are technically difficult and intestinal protein loss is more commonly a result of either bacterial overgrowth or protein losing gastroenteropathy. Enteral protein loss should be directly demonstrable by measurement of the alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance. In massive enteral protein loss, the exact site of protein leakage may be localized by the infusion of 99mTc-albumin and gamma camera scintigraphy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-losing-gastroenteropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein-losing gastroenteropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations are highly correlated to small bowel length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In patients with short bowel syndrome, postabsorptive plasma citrulline determination can be used to estimate functional absorptive bowel length and help determine the likelihood of permanent intestinal failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional tests are used to assess small bowel function, bile acid absorption, and pancreatic function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">SeHCAT test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile acid malabsorption most often occurs when more than 100 cm of terminal ileum has been removed but can also result from disease of the terminal ileum (usually Crohn disease), HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], or primary abnormalities in bile acid absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. It has been proposed that primary bile salt malabsorption may reflect impaired fibroblast growth factor 19 feedback inhibition causing excessive bile acid synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An association with gallbladder dysfunction (Habba syndrome) has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Presentation of the excess bile salts to the colon can lead to diarrhea (called cholerheic enteropathy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with diarrhea in association with terminal ileal resection are often treated with a bile acid binding resin such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>. Such a therapeutic trial will often be effective if the extent of resection (or disease) is not so large as to cause steatorrhea. If this is ineffective, or in patients with terminal ileal disease in whom the diarrhea does not respond to conventional antidiarrheal or anti-Crohn therapy, objective evidence of cholerheic enteropathy can be established by the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a> homocholic acid taurine (75SeHCAT) test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. The SeHCAT test involves the administration of a selenium75 labeled synthetic bile acid (selen-homotaurocholic acid) orally, followed by measurement of retention of the bile acid by whole body scan or gamma camera at seven days (abnormal is less than 5 percent).</p><p>However, the SeHCAT test is not used commonly. Quantitative measurement of bile acids in stool in patients who did not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a> may be the method of choice to diagnose cholerheic enteropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for bacterial overgrowth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth is the direct quantitative measurement of bacterial counts from aspirated intestinal fluid. Normal counts rarely exceed <span class=\"nowrap\">10(4)/mL</span> in the jejunum and <span class=\"nowrap\">10(5)/mL</span> in the ileum. However, direct estimation of bacterial counts in the gut requires intubation of the intestine and careful technique to avoid contamination from oral or nasal sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As a result, hydrogen breath tests with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> or other carbohydrate substrates have replaced bacterial cultures for the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for pancreatic insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several invasive and noninvasive tests are available for the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency, which can be classified as direct or indirect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditionally, direct tests involve the stimulation of the pancreas through the administration of a meal or hormonal secretagogues after which duodenal fluid is collected and analyzed to quantify normal pancreatic secretory content (ie, enzymes, and bicarbonate). Only a few specialized centers perform these tests. A much simpler direct test is measurement of fecal elastase-1. In mild insufficiency, the latter lacks some of the sensitivity possessed by more traditional testing, but it is accurate in moderate to severe insufficiency and its simplicity and convenience make it a useful test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect tests measure the consequences of pancreatic insufficiency and are more widely available. However, they depend upon the consequences of pancreatic maldigestion, which are generally not apparent until normal enzyme secretory output has declined by more than 90 percent. Thus, they are insensitive to early pancreatic insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3537521994\"><span class=\"h2\">Schilling test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Schilling test identifies the cause of vitamin B12 malabsorption. However, it is rarely performed given the availability of serum B12 and methylmalonic acid to diagnose B12 deficiency and the easy use of oral crystalline or parenteral injection of B12. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency#H2922895776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency&quot;, section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2841344580\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-acute-diarrhea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Acute diarrhea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of malabsorption depend upon the cause and severity of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology can often be obtained from a detailed patient history, which can also exclude other causes of symptoms. As an example, a history of intestinal resection or chronic pancreatitis may suggest the diagnosis in patients with characteristic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59713 \">table 4</a>). Deficiencies of specific nutrients and vitamins may also identify the underlying cause and its duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because symptoms may be absent or mimic other diseases, a routine battery of blood tests is often helpful as an initial step when malabsorption is suspected, although blood tests alone should not be considered as being sufficient to establish a diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several invasive and noninvasive tests are available to establish the cause of malabsorption. If the history suggests a particular cause, testing can be directed to confirm the diagnosis. Further testing may not be necessary in patients who have gross steatorrhea (increased fecal fat excretion) with an obvious cause (such as cystic fibrosis or short bowel syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-the-short-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of the short bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The order of testing and choice of a particular test should be individualized while considering the availability and expertise needed for specialized testing. While many tests are established as gold standards for the diagnosis of particular forms of malabsorption, new tests continue to be developed and their diagnostic characteristics remain uncertain. Thus, optimal strategies for diagnosis are still evolving. Our approach is described above.
