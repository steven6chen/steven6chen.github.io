Endobronchial biopsy is the preferred sampling procedure for such lesions because it will provide histological information, whereas the other procedures provide only cytological and microbiological information. Cryobiopsy in this situation may provide a larger biopsy sample if available to the operator, with an added risk of bleeding. If the lesion is large or has a necrotic layer, however, the forceps are likely to grasp the necrotic surface and be nondiagnostic. Needle aspiration or needle core biopsy is a reasonable alternative in this situation because it may provide a good sample from deeper tissue.

BAL and brushing provide cytological and microbiological information, while transbronchial biopsy provides histological information about the lung parenchyma, including the distal airways and alveoli. Newer techniques that utilize imaging or navigational technology to biopsy peripheral nodules enhance the diagnostic yield but are limited to centers with expertise. Transbronchial cryobiopsies can provide a larger sample with an added risk of bleeding.

As an example, the diagnostic utility for transbronchial biopsy for sarcoidosis is high while the yield is lower for other interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) and for peripheral lesions suspected to be cancerous. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage is helpful in the evaluation of ILDs but not diagnostic; in contrast, it may be more helpful for the diagnosis of pneumonia in the immunosuppressed patient.

The brush is pushed out from the sheath and briskly rubbed against the lesion multiple times in order to trap any cells or micro-organisms within its bristles. Finally, the brush is retracted within its sheath and both the brush and sheath are withdrawn from the bronchoscope. The sample is prepared by placing the brush in saline or cytological fixative, or by smearing the brush onto a microscope slide. The airway is inspected for bleeding, which is usually minor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To obtain a specimen from a parenchymal lesion that is beyond the bronchoscopic visualization field, the bronchoscope is placed in or near the bronchus that leads to the lesion, as determined from prior imaging studies.

Fluoroscopy, if available, can guide accurate placement of the brush before the specimen is collected.</p><p/><p>The purpose of the catheter sheath is to prevent contamination of the brush with oropharyngeal flora that may remain inside the working channel of the bronchoscope, as well as to protect the inside of the working channel from damage by the brush.

BAL cannot be used to obtain tissue for histologic analysis, although rarely architectural features or other features that are diagnostic of some conditions (eg, alveolar hemorrhage, glandular formation in adenocarcinoma) can be appreciated. </p><p>It involves the instillation of sequential aliquots of sterile saline in to a bronchoalveolar segment from a bronchoscope that is wedged into the second or third order of bronchi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076 \">figure 1</a>).

Bronchial washings are similar to BAL, except washings do not require that the bronchoscope be wedged and they require a smaller volume of sterile saline. They are usually contaminated by oral flora and do not provide a good specimen for determining the differential cell count.

Therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures are typically targeted at relieving central airway obstruction.
