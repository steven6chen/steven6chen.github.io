Along with other technologic advancements, such as the administration of antepartum corticosteroids and replacement surfactant therapy, mechanical ventilation has led to improved neonatal survival, especially for preterm infants born less than 30 weeks gestation with immature lung function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence and mortality of the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although mechanical ventilation can be lifesaving, it may cause chronic lung injury resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a major complication of prematurity. As a result, continued efforts have been focused upon development of new technology, including the use of early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in preterm infants at risk for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and strategies for neonatal ventilator care to maintain adequate gas exchange but minimize lung damage.

In CMV, the minute ventilation is the product of frequency of breaths and tidal volume. Delivery of conventional ventilation varies by how the breath is initiated (ventilator or patient-triggered), how the delivered tidal volume is regulated (eg, pressure or volume control), how the breath is terminated (eg, volume-, time-, or flow-regulated), and the rate of ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Types of breaths'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-frequency ventilation</strong> (HFV) is based upon the delivery of small volumes of respiratory gas, which are equal to or smaller than the anatomic dead space, at an extremely rapid rate (300 to 1500 breaths per minute). In HFV, minute ventilation is the product of frequency of breaths and the square of the tidal volume.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CONVENTIONAL VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time-cycled, pressure-limited (TCPL) ventilator is the most commonly used ventilator in neonates. TCPL ventilators provide a continuous flow of warmed, humidified gas through the breathing circuit, allowing the patient to breathe spontaneously at any time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73743487\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of conventional ventilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In its first decades of neonatal use, the TCPL provided pressure-limited ventilation with a <span class=\"nowrap\">continuous/intermittent</span> mandatory ventilation (IMV) rate. With a better appreciation of respiratory physiology and risk factors for neonatal lung injury, modifications of the TCPL ventilator have led to a new generation of ventilators focused on reducing the risk of chronic lung injury by primary control of the tidal volume delivered.</p><p>In general, the following settings are used in the TCPL ventilator, which determine the type of delivered breath to the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of inspiratory gas flow either by pressure or volume control (ventilatory modalities):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When pressure is controlled (ie, pressure-limited), the tidal volume delivered will fluctuate depending on the lung compliance of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When volume is controlled (ie, volume-targeted), the pressure needed to deliver a targeted tidal volume will vary depending on lung compliance of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation of the breath (ventilatory modes) &ndash; Breaths can be either mandatory or triggered by the spontaneous breath of the patient. The same mandatory or synchronized options for ventilatory modes are available for both pressure and volume-regulated ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time of inspiration and expiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is the distending positive pressure during expiration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73743528\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilatory mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of ventilatory modes (initiation of breath) for neonates has expanded from the initial sole option of IMV, in which a mandatory rate of breaths is provided at regular intervals and is <strong>not </strong>affected by the infant's spontaneous breathing, to options that synchronize some or all of the ventilator breaths with the patient's spontaneous breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73743714\"><span class=\"h3\">Synchronized (patient-triggered) ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synchronization may improve patient comfort and has been reported to lower mean airway pressure (MAP) and reduce the need for sedatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Available data demonstrate some, but not substantial, benefit of synchronized versus nonsynchronized ventilation in neonates, including fewer periods of low oxygen saturation and less variability in breath-to-breath exhaled tidal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. However, synchronized neonatal ventilation does not appear to reduce the mortality rate or the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This was illustrated in a meta-analysis with the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there was a trend towards an increase in the death rate of infants using the synchronized IMV (SIMV) or patient-triggered ventilator compared with those with conventional IMV, this was not statistically significant (relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 0.94-1.47).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences in the rates of air leaks, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), BPD, or extubation failure between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a shorter duration of ventilation in the infants who received synchronized versus conventional ventilation (weighted mean difference of -38 hours, 95% CI -54 to 23 hours).</p><p/><p>Although the overall outcome of mortality rate and the incidence of BPD did not differ between infants who received synchronized versus nonsynchronized ventilation, experts in the field suggest that synchronization may be useful in a subgroup of preterm infants below 28 weeks of age, as it shortens the period of ventilation in this population of patients who are more susceptible to mechanical ventilatory lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Ventilators that provide synchronization measure inspiratory flow, pressure change, or movement, and when a preset value is reached, a breath is initiated. Synchronized modalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SIMV provides mechanical breaths, which are set by the clinician, in synchrony with the onset of spontaneous breaths that meet the preset inspiratory flow by the infant within a timing window. The selected set rate is typically lower than the infant's spontaneous breathing rate, so additional spontaneous breaths occur without ventilator support. PEEP is provided for every breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <span class=\"nowrap\">assist/control</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(A/C)</span> ventilation, the ventilator delivers a breath each time the patient's inspiratory effort exceeds a preset threshold criterion. The clinician sets the inspiratory time and peak inflation pressure or target tidal volume. The clinician also sets a minimum mandatory ventilator rate to maintain adequate minute ventilation, should the spontaneous respiratory rate fall below the minimum selected rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is similar to <span class=\"nowrap\">A/C</span> mode in that each spontaneous patient breath that exceeds a preset trigger results in a ventilator support breath. However, each breath is terminated when inspiratory gas flow falls to a predetermined proportion of peak flow (usually 15 to 20 percent). As a result, the patient determines the rate and pattern of breathing (inspiratory time or inspiratory:expiratory [I:E] ratio). PSV counteracts the resistance imposed by the endotracheal tube and ventilator circuit by providing additional inspiratory flow that is limited to a preset pressure selected by the clinician. A higher inspiratory flow rate (shorter inspiratory rise time or slope) shortens the time to reach maximal airway pressure, which decreases the work of breathing. However, there is a paucity of data on the use of PSV alone in neonates requiring full ventilator support for respiratory failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, there is evidence that PSV in combination with SIMV reduces the work of breathing by decreasing mandatory ventilatory rate and MAP and increases minute ventilation compared with SIMV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, a randomized trial of 107 preterm infants found that patients randomly assigned to a combination of PSV and SIMV were less likely to require mechanical ventilation at 28 days of life than those assigned to SIMV alone (47 versus 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, the mean total days of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen, need for oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and mortality and complication rates (ie, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], grade III or IV IVH, necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC], or stage III retinopathy of prematurity [ROP]) did not differ between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) uses electrical activity from the diaphragm (EAdi), recorded by a specialized nasogastric tube in the lower esophagus, to synchronize mechanical ventilator breaths. Observational studies in neonates report NAVA, compared with other forms of synchronized conventional ventilation, improved patient-ventilator interaction and reduced peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and sedation, while maintaining similar blood gas values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Signal integrity is maintained during nasogastric tube feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. NAVA can be delivered as a component of noninvasive nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) without endotracheal intubation and appears effective even in the presence of large air leaks (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn#H2805720603\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive oxygen delivery and oxygen monitoring in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist'</a>). However, most studies have involved only short periods of NAVA ventilation. Further research is needed to determine effects on patient outcome if NAVA is utilized for more typical neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) respiratory support.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750443\"><span class=\"h2\">Modality: Pressure-limited or volume-targeted ventilation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73743453\"><span class=\"h3\">Pressure-limited ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this modality, there is a limitation of the amount of pressure that can be delivered during inspiration, which is set by the clinician (PIP). The delivered tidal volume is regulated by the selected inspiratory time and PIP, the patient's lung compliance, and the degree of synchrony between the infant's spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilatory breaths. Inspiration is terminated at the end of the selected inspiratory time. The inspiratory time must be sufficient to maintain an inspiratory pressure plateau that allows flow to rise to maximum then drop to zero by the end of inspiration. The inspiratory flow pattern for pressure-limited ventilation typically is characterized by an initial accelerated gas flow that achieves peak pressure early in inspiration (front load) followed by a deceleration of flow toward the end of the inspiratory phase.</p><p>Modifications of the simple original TCPL systems have resulted in a new generation of pressure-limited ventilators that can support synchronized ventilation. These ventilators use a controlled &quot;demand flow&quot; circuitry, which matches inspiratory gas delivery closer to the breathing pattern of the individual patients. In addition, some devices include software algorithms to compensate for air leaks around the uncuffed endotracheal tube. Three main pressure-targeted modalities that have been used in neonates include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure-control SIMV (PC-SIMV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure-control <span class=\"nowrap\">A/C</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(PC-A/C)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure-control PSV (PC-PSV)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73743459\"><span class=\"h4\">Advantages and disadvantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advantages of the pressure-limited TCPL ventilators are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are relatively easy to use and less costly than other ventilators.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The continuous flow of circuit gas allows for spontaneous patient breathing, and weaning can occur by progressively reducing PIP and mandatory ventilator rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIP and MAP can be adjusted to optimize gas exchange and attempt to reduce contribution of these factors to chronic lung injury.</p><p/><p>Disadvantages include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The variation of tidal volume from breath to breath is the main disadvantage of pressure-limited ventilation. Delivered tidal volume changes when there are alterations in lung compliance and resistance (eg, with the administration of surfactant), circuit compressed gas volume, and endotracheal tube leak. In a study of preterm infants, exhaled tidal volume was greater than the targeted volume for 25 percent of the breaths and less than the targeted volume for 36 percent of breaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These large variations in delivered volume over time subject the immature lungs of preterm infants to risks of both overdistension and collapse of air spaces resulting in lung injury <span class=\"nowrap\">(volutrauma/atelectrauma)</span>. This is particularly problematic following the administration of surfactant in very preterm infants below 32 weeks gestation, when lung compliance may rapidly change resulting in the delivery of excessive volume with the risk of progressive hypocarbia (risk factor for IVH), pulmonary air leak due to pulmonary overdistension, and lung injury (volutrauma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased work of breathing during spontaneous breaths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor synchrony between spontaneous and mandatory breaths has been associated with deterioration in oxygenation, increases in partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and reduction in tidal volume and minute ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This issue has been addressed with the newer forms of TCPL that provide synchronized ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume-targeted ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume-targeted ventilators, which have been progressively improved since the late 1990s, provide a more consistent tidal volume during neonatal mechanical ventilation, resulting in less lung injury than pressure-limited ventilation. The development of volume-targeted neonatal ventilation was prompted by evidence that volume distension of the lung, rather than peak airway pressure, induced lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. As discussed above, pressure-limited ventilation poorly controls the delivered tidal volume, resulting in a wide range of breath-to-breath tidal volumes leading to cycles of overdistension and atelectasis. In a 2011 international survey, volume-targeted ventilation had replaced pressure-limited ventilation in 25 of the 50 neonatal tertiary units surveyed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In the neonate, three modes of volume-targeted ventilation generally have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volume-controlled (VC) ventilation</strong> &ndash; The first ventilator developed for volume-targeted ventilation was the VC ventilator. In traditional VC ventilation, a set tidal volume is delivered by variation in PIP, regardless of underlying lung compliance. The clinician presets the target tidal volume (generally 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> and in addition, mandatory respiratory rate and an inspiratory time limit are set for safety. The duration of inflation is dependent upon the time to deliver the set tidal volume. However, the total volume may not be delivered if the preset inspiratory time limit is exceeded. The rate of flow, PIP, and inspiratory time may vary from breath to breath based on lung compliance. In VC ventilation, the peak flow and pressure are generated at the end of inspiration (back load), which differs from the front load of pressure-limited ventilation, which reaches peak pressure and flow early in inspiration. A shortcoming of many VC ventilators is that they control and measure the tidal volume of gas delivered into the circuit and not what is actually delivered to the patient's lungs. If they do not measure exhaled tidal volume, then there is no compensation for endotracheal tube leaks or compressed gas loss in the circuit. Newer models do offer design features to compensate for these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volume-guarantee (VG) ventilation</strong> &ndash; VG ventilation is based on a pressure-targeted ventilatory modality, which has been modified with the addition of a microprocessor that adjusts the pressure as needed to ensure a <strong>targeted tidal volume</strong>. The clinician selects an expiratory tidal volume target, inspiratory time, and a maximum inspiratory pressure limit (Pmax). The Pmax must be set high enough to allow fluctuation in the actual &quot;working&quot; PIP. A flow sensor is placed at the endotracheal tube connection, which measures both inspired and expired tidal volume. The machine uses the exhaled tidal volume as a reference to adjust the inspiratory pressure over the next few breaths to achieve the target volume. Inspiratory pressure decreases with improvement in lung compliance and increased spontaneous respiratory effort by the infant (&quot;self-weaning&quot;). Failure to achieve the target tidal volume may occur if Pmax is insufficient, inspiratory time is too short, or in the presence of large endotracheal tube leaks (greater than 40 to 50 percent). Large endotracheal tube leaks may be lessened by changing the infant's body position; however, in certain circumstances, large endotracheal tube leaks may prevent the use of VG ventilation and require reversion to pressure support mode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">VG can be used in conjunction with synchronized ventilatory modes including SIMV, <span class=\"nowrap\">A/C,</span> and PSV. In our centers, it is the ventilator mode of choice for most neonates with respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC)</strong> &ndash; PRVC is also a modified pressure-targeted ventilatory mode, in which inspiratory pressure is sequentially adjusted to deliver a <strong>target inspiratory volume</strong> with the lowest possible pressures. The clinician selects the target tidal volume and the maximum pressure allowed for delivery. In this modality, a short test breath sequence is delivered and is used as a test for the microprocessor to calculate the pressure needed to deliver the targeted volume. The inspiratory pressure of subsequent breaths is increased by 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O until the targeted tidal volume or maximum allowable inspiratory pressure is reached. If the tidal volume is exceeded, inspiratory pressure is decreased by 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O increments.

Although there are differences in their designs, available high-frequency (HF) ventilators deliver similar ventilatory output. Each HF ventilator applies continuous distending pressure to maintain lung expansion and superimposes small tidal volumes at a rapid rate.</p><p>The following HF ventilators are used in neonates:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high-frequency oscillator ventilator (HFOV) delivers small tidal volumes by oscillating air movements produced by the ventilator diaphragm or piston at frequencies of 600 to 900 breaths per minute (10 to 15 Hz), which result in both positive and negative pressure fluctuations and gas mixing. The clinician sets the amplitude and frequency of the pressure wave generated by the ventilator piston or diaphragm, mean airway pressure (MAP), inspiratory time, and fractional inspired concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>). Unlike the other two modes of HFV, expiration is an active process with HFOV, and sigh breaths are not utilized. HFOV has been the most extensively studied HFV mode in neonates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high-frequency jet ventilator (HFJV) uses time-cycled, pressure-limited (TCPL), constant gas flow interrupters that are used in parallel with a conventional ventilator, which provides positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and intermittent conventional breaths at 2 to 10 breaths per minute (referred to as sigh breaths). Sigh breaths are thought to prevent atelectasis. High-frequency jet breaths are delivered through a special endotracheal adapter. The clinician sets peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) for both the jet and conventional breaths, PEEP, frequency of jet breaths (usually 420 breaths per minute), the inspiratory jet valve on-time (usually 0.02 seconds), and FiO<sub>2</sub>. Expiration is passive and is dependent on chest wall and lung recoil.</p><p/><p>Although data from animal studies suggested that HFV appeared to reduce lung injury compared with conventional ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], most studies show <strong>no</strong> significant benefit with any form of HFV compared with conventional ventilation in reducing mortality rate or the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm human infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164619\"><span class=\"h2\">Elective HFOV versus conventional ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic reviews have reported no additional benefit of elective high-frequency oscillator ventilator (HFOV) compared with conventional ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. This was best illustrated in a meta-analysis of 10 trials with 3229 patients <strong>using individual patients' data</strong> that demonstrated no difference in the outcome between elective HFOV and conventional ventilation in the treatment of preterm infants with RDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

There were no differences in the mortality rate, the need for intermittent positive pressure ventilation at 28 days of age, or the incidences of PIE or gross pulmonary leak (eg, pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum) between the two groups. In patients without PIE at study entry, infants assigned to HFOV compared with those who received conventional ventilation had a lower risk of developing pulmonary air leak (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.96).
