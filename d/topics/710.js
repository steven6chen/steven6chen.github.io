Data regarding plazomicin, an aminoglycoside under development in the United States for the treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, will not be included in this discussion.</p><p>The most common clinical application (either alone or as part of combination therapy) of the aminoglycosides is for the treatment of serious infections caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. While less common, aminoglycosides (in combination with other agents) have also been used for the treatment of select gram-positive infections. In addition, certain aminoglycosides have demonstrated clinically relevant activity against protozoa (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a>), <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> (spectinomycin, not available in the United States), and mycobacterial infections (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>, and [most commonly] <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>).</p><p>This topic will review basic issues related to the clinical use of parenteral aminoglycosides, including mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and adverse effects. Dosing and monitoring of aminoglycosides and administration in certain patients populations are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dosing and administration of parenteral aminoglycosides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The multiple clinical settings in which the aminoglycosides may be used are also discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.

The initial steps required for peptide synthesis, such as binding of mRNA and the association of the 50S ribosomal subunit, are uninterrupted, but elongation fails to occur due to disruption of the mechanisms for ensuring translational accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The ensuing antimicrobial activity is usually bactericidal against susceptible aerobic gram-negative bacilli.</p><p>Aminoglycosides initially penetrate the organism by disrupting the magnesium and calcium bridges between lipopolysaccharide moieties. They are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane in an energy-dependent manner. This step can be inhibited in vitro by divalent cations, increased osmolality, acidic pH, and an anaerobic environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The microbiologic activity of aminoglycosides is pH dependent. As a result, the antimicrobial effect may be reduced at the low pH found in lung and bronchial secretions. In an in vitro study, for example, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of aminoglycosides was increased almost five-fold at a pH &lt;6.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Activity may also be reduced in the presence of biofilms, such as those seen with mucoid-producing strains of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> commonly isolated in cystic fibrosis patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, aminoglycosides are active across a broad spectrum of aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive organisms as well as mycobacteria. Of note, anaerobic bacteria are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120095666\"><span class=\"h2\">Gram-negative organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aminoglycosides exhibit potent in vitro activity against a wide range of aerobic gram-negative pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp, <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>. However, in vitro activity against <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>, <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>, and anaerobic bacteria is usually poor or absent.</p><p>Differences may exist among the in vitro potencies of the various aminoglycosides. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> usually demonstrates superior in vitro activity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> against <em>Serratia</em> spp, while tobramycin is usually more potent than gentamicin against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> generally demonstrates the most potent activity in vitro, followed closely by gentamicin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The magnitude of these differences can vary between different strains across different institutions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120095672\"><span class=\"h2\">Gram-positive organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aminoglycosides also demonstrate activity in vitro against gram-positive organisms, such as <em>Staphylococcus&nbsp;aureus</em>. However, most authorities believe these drugs are not adequate therapy as monotherapy for serious infections caused by <em>S. aureus</em>. Aminoglycoside activity against pneumococci is generally considered insufficient for clinical application against these organisms. Aminoglycosides are not active alone against streptococci and enterococci, although may have additive or synergistic effects against these pathogens when combined with other agents and in the absence of high-level resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120095678\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycobacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Streptomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> demonstrate favorable activity in vitro against mycobacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Specifically, streptomycin is particularly active against <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, and amikacin is generally the most active aminoglycoside against <em>Mycobacterium fortuitum</em>, <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em>, and <em>Mycobacterium chelonae</em>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120096104\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with other classes of antibiotics, the aminoglycosides have demonstrated relative stability against the development of resistance. However, both intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides have been described. </p><p>Aminoglycoside resistance among gram-negative organisms can occur through acquisition or upregulation of genes that encode inactivating enzymes or efflux systems. Emergence of resistance in gram-negative bacilli during treatment with aminoglycosides occurs infrequently.</p><p>Organisms resistant to other antimicrobials (such as those producing possessing <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>carbapenemases [KPCs], as well as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [ESBLs]), are often resistant to aminoglycosides due to the presence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Enterococci have intrinsic resistance to low and moderate levels of aminoglycosides and can acquire resistance to high levels. (See <a href=\"#H120096136\" class=\"local\">'Enterococci'</a> below.) </p><p>While cross resistance between the specific aminoglycoside agents does occur, it is incomplete. Therefore, individual agents should be tested for in vitro susceptibility against the isolated pathogen whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120096130\"><span class=\"h2\">Gram-negative organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance of gram-negative organisms to aminoglycosides occurs by two major mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial production of inactivating enzymes &mdash; The most common mechanism has been inactivation of the drug by phosphorylation (mediated by aminoglycoside kinases), adenylation, or acetylation (mediated by transferases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/4,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another mechanism of inactivation is methylation of 16S ribosomal RNA. This effect is mediated by an enzyme encoded by the rmtA gene and has been associated with high-level resistance to all parenteral aminoglycosides in current use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Binding to the aminoacyl site on 16S ribosomal RNA is the mechanism by which aminoglycosides normally interfere with protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Inactivating enzymes can be encoded by plasmids or associated with transposable elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. Plasmid exchange and dissemination of transposons facilitate the acquisition of drug resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased permeability and reduced intracellular accumulation of the drug &mdash; Aminoglycoside resistance independent of inactivating enzymes has been known for some time in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This resistance is characterized by resistance to all aminoglycosides and may be due to either to an efflux system or decreased drug permeability that results in reduced levels of aminoglycoside accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Unlike most other antimicrobial classes, emergence of aminoglycoside resistance during treatment is infrequently encountered during management of gram-negative infections. Additionally, certain aminoglycoside agents may retain activity despite resistance to other drugs in the class, depending on the mechanisms of resistance. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> has been effective in some institutions against selected organisms with high rates of in vitro microbial resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>. Rates of susceptibility to gentamicin and tobramycin have also been observed to improve after amikacin was introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120096136\"><span class=\"h2\">Enterococci</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to low to moderate levels of aminoglycosides. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> are usually 8 to 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and those of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> are 64 to 512 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. However, the potential for synergy exists when enterococci with low-level resistance to an aminoglycoside are exposed to a combination of the aminoglycoside with a cell wall active agent, such as penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>.</p><p>There are increasing reports of acquired high-level enterococcal resistance to aminoglycosides (MIC &gt;2,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span>. The significance of such high-level resistance is that it eliminates the synergism expected between an aminoglycoside and a cell wall active agent. Different genetic mutations are responsible for high-level resistance to different aminoglycosides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in enterococci&quot;, section on 'Aminoglycoside resistance'</a>.)</p><p>A naturally occurring characteristic of <em>Enterococcus faecium</em> is moderate-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> (MICs 64 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> and resistance to synergism. This is due to the presence of an aminoglycoside modifying enzyme that modifies tobramycin but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This enzyme also eliminates synergy between cell wall-active agents and tobramycin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kanamycin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">kanamycin</a>, and netilmicin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in enterococci&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the relatively broad spectrum of activity of aminoglycosides, their widespread clinical use is limited because of the availability of alternative, less toxic agents with comparable efficacy and without the need for serum drug concentration monitoring. Aminoglycosides remain important as a second agent in treatment of serious infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli and certain gram-positive organisms and as part of a multidrug regimen for certain mycobacterial infections. There are rare instances (especially outside the urinary tract) in which monotherapy with aminoglycosides is adequate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120095709\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination antibacterial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent clinical use of aminoglycosides (most commonly in combination with other antibacterial agents) is empiric therapy of serious infections, such as septicemia, nosocomial respiratory tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The intent of such therapy is to increase the chances that the pathogen is susceptible to at least one agent in the combination. This strategy appears less relevant, particularly given the risks of aminoglycoside-related adverse effects, in settings where the incidence of antibiotic resistance is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>Once an organism has been identified and its susceptibilities determined to alternate agents, aminoglycosides are usually discontinued in favor of less toxic antibiotics to complete a treatment course. Combination therapy against gram-negative organisms is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gram-negative-bacillary-bacteremia-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications and rationale for combination therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections#H6675458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of antimicrobial therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections&quot;, section on 'Combination antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> is frequently used for the treatment of invasive enterococcal infections (such as endocarditis) not exhibiting high-level aminoglycoside resistance and sometimes for serious infections due to certain streptococci. However, even in some of these cases (as with enterococcal endocarditis) the toxicity of prolonged aminoglycosides has led to preferred use of other combination regimens. These uses are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Dosing adjustments should be based upon the results of serum drug concentration monitoring. Certain populations have significant variability in dosing requirements, including (but not limited to) neonates and patients with burns, critical illness, renal impairment, and cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Dosing and monitoring of parenteral aminoglycosides are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dosing and administration of parenteral aminoglycosides&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACODYNAMICS AND KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain pharmacodynamic and kinetic properties of the aminoglycoside are important for their clinical application. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) and concentration-dependent killing characteristics of aminoglycosides allow for efficacy when dosed at an extended interval for certain infections, and the synergistic effect with cell wall-active agents has led to the frequent use of aminoglycosides in combination with these agents for serious infections. Limitations in the distribution of aminoglycosides restrict their use for infections at certain anatomical sites, as poor penetration is achieved in the CSF, biliary tree, and bronchial secretions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120094867\"><span class=\"h2\">Post antibiotic effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The post antibiotic effect (PAE) refers to the persistent suppression of bacterial growth that occurs after the drug has been removed in vitro or cleared by drug metabolism and excretion in vivo. Initially described for gram-negative bacilli, aminoglycosides also exhibit PAE against <em>S. aureus</em> but not against other gram-positive cocci. The duration of the PAE (approximately 3 hours [range 1 to 7.5 hours]) depends upon the method of evaluation and the organism studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In general, the PAE is longer for gram-negative organisms than gram-positive organisms. The duration of the PAE is reduced in the absence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120094873\"><span class=\"h2\">Concentration-dependent killing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concentration-dependent killing refers to the ability of higher concentrations of aminoglycosides (relative to the organism's MIC) to induce more rapid, and complete, killing of the pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Aminoglycosides exhibit concentration-dependent microbiologic activity in both in vivo and in vitro models. Achieving optimal peak concentrations of aminoglycosides with standard dosing regimens can be difficult, since efforts must be made to avoid sustained elevated trough concentrations (which can predispose to nephrotoxicity). Relative to traditional dosing methods, the consolidated dosing approach is more likely to achieve optimal peak concentrations that result in concentration-dependent killing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aminoglycosides/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The terminal half-life ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 hours in adults with normal renal function. The half-life is prolonged in neonates, infants, and patients with decreased renal function.</p><p>Aminoglycosides are effectively removed by both hemodialysis (continuous and intermittent) and peritoneal dialysis.

Microbiologic activity is pH-dependent, and acidic environments, like those found in the lung and bronchial secretions, may decrease the antimicrobial effect. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aminoglycosides exhibit potent in vitro activity against a wide range of aerobic gram-negative pathogens; <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> and <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em> are particular exceptions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gentamicin</a> usually demonstrates superior in vitro activity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> against <em>Serratia</em> spp, while tobramycin is usually more potent than gentamicin against <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. Aminoglycosides (most notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>) are also active against mycobacteria.

Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to moderate levels of aminoglycosides. The potential for synergy in combination with a cell wall-active agent remains unless the enterococcus has acquired high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. (See <a href=\"#H120096104\" class=\"local\">'Resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aminoglycosides are most frequently used in combination with another antibacterial agent for empiric therapy of septicemia, nosocomial respiratory tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. They are often discontinued in favor of less toxic antibiotics once organism identity and susceptibility has been confirmed.
