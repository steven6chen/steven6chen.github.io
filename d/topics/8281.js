In 1985, 7 percent of AIDS cases were in adult women compared to 27 percent in 2007. </p><p>Since the initial reports of AIDS in women, women from minority populations have been disproportionately represented. In 1997, rates in African American and Latina women were 20 and 7 times higher than in Caucasians (58.8 and 21.5, respectively, versus 3.0 per 100,000) with persistence of over-representation of minorities in both AIDS and newly reported HIV infections through 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In 2011, approximately 85 percent of women diagnosed with AIDS were from communities of color, with 67 percent in non-Hispanic Blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Many women with AIDS come from communities with a history of poor access to health care and with high rates of poverty, unstable housing, domestic violence, and substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one study in which 291 women with AIDS were interviewed between 1990 and 1992, 90 percent were unemployed, 83 percent had an annual income under $10,000 USD, and approximately half had at least one child under the age of 15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Even decades later, HIV in women is still disproportionately represented in poor disadvantaged communities. There are limited data on the natural history of AIDS in women independent of these social and economic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, increasing numbers of women with AIDS are from rural and smaller metropolitan areas rather than large urban centers, communities that often face additional barriers to access and retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for HIV acquisition</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602288701\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterosexual contact is the most common reported risk factor for women, having overtaken injection drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A number of risk factors for acquisition are shared between men and women, including presence of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections, higher viral loads, and unprotected sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of nonoccupational exposures to HIV and hepatitis B and C in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been proposed that during the normal menstrual cycle, there is a period lasting approximately 7 to 10 days when innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity are suppressed by estradiol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone, enhancing the potential for acquisition of HIV by women; this hypothesis requires further exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, even if this may represent a period of higher risk, primary prevention efforts for women should continue to emphasize the need for consistent adherence to safer sex practices regardless of timing in the menstrual cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602288707\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk associated with contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have raised concern that certain hormonal contraceptive methods, particularly depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DPMA), are associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition, although data are mixed, and decreased condom use among women using hormonal contraception may have been a potential confounder. The data remain too uncertain to warrant limiting women at risk for HIV infection to certain contraceptive methods. Nevertheless, women at risk should always be advised to use condoms, regardless of other contraceptive use, to prevent transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>In several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluated the risk of HIV with contraceptive use and also accounted for condom use, there was no evident association between HIV infection and oral contraception, but an apparent increased risk of HIV acquisition with DPMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Differences across included studies in adjusting for other potential confounders, including sexual behavior, limit interpretation of these results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception&quot;, section on 'Effect on HIV acquisition and transmission'</a>.)</p><p>Intrauterine contraception does not appear to increase the risk of HIV acquisition over that in users of other contraceptives. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> and copper IUDs appear to decrease HIV target cell populations in the female genital tract and may therefore decrease the risk of HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For women at risk of HIV infection who are also at risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a progestin-containing contraceptive, including a levonorgestrel IUD, may be preferable due to protection against ascending infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602288713\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential interventions to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition include post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following a high-risk exposure to HIV and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for women who are at continued high-risk of HIV infection (such as those in discordant sexual relationships, sex workers). Of note, studies evaluating the efficacy of oral PrEP in women have had mixed results. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection#H2027975901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Heterosexual women'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-risk-factors-and-prevention-strategies#H2662263261\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies&quot;, section on 'Individuals at risk for HIV'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The understanding of the presence and extent of differences between the sexes in the natural history of HIV and the progression to AIDS continues to evolve. Early in the epidemic, a number of studies reported higher mortality and increased progression of <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> in women compared with men. However, more careful analyses incorporating other potential factors such as HIV risk, age, and the AIDS-defining condition showed that these differences were largely explained by decreased access to quality care and treatment rather than representing a more aggressive disease progression in women on biological grounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Women who receive care in more experienced clinics survive longer than women cared for by less experienced clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, even among established HIV clinics and adjusting for insurance rates, race and transmission, women were still less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Delay in diagnosis is also common, with one-third of women either presenting with AIDS at the time of their HIV diagnosis or progressing to AIDS within the first 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In 1996, declines in AIDS-related mortality began to be noted, attributed to improved HIV treatment with ART and improved prevention of opportunistic infections (OIs). However, the decline in AIDS-related mortality for women was less dramatic and lagged behind that of men (10 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], although the rates of survival three years after diagnosis are now similar for men and women overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This delay in benefit has not been fully explained but, based upon the experiences earlier in the epidemic, is probably in part related to decreased access to or use of quality care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/18,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,21</a>], although ongoing work to understand the potential impact of biological differences continues. In contrast, emerging data from resource-limited settings suggests the opposite, with men having higher adjusted mortality rates than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Regardless, AIDS remains a leading cause of death in women from minority populations, and mortality rates among women of color diagnosed with HIV remain higher than white women diagnosed in the same year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression and HIV disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression may be a contributory factor for HIV progression in women. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 765 HIV seropositive women in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], those with chronic depressive symptoms were twice as likely to die as those with mild or no depressive symptoms, after controlling for clinical features and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCESS TO QUALITY OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of barriers to care exist for women, ranging from concrete needs (childcare, transportation, housing lack of insurance) to psychological and social barriers (fear of disclosure, denial, and cultural mistrust of the health care system) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, a large percentage of women with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> provide primary care for family members who may include children or other patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span>. Thus, it is not uncommon for women to compromise their own care to provide care for others. Finally, there has been growing recognition of high rates of intimate partner and other violence against women, which may prevent HIV-infected women from accessing or remaining in medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the national <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> Strategy emphasizes the importance of engaging and retaining people living with HIV in care and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Extensive work has been done describing barriers and facilitators to entry and retention which exist at including personal-, provider-, clinic-, and community-levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Less is known about interventions which are effective at keeping women in care, but evidence suggests that women may now have similar rates of linkage into care and similar to higher rates of retention in care compared with men, after years of having lower rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Specific areas which have been important in helping women remain in care include ensuring that the clinic environment and services are responsive to the many socioeconomic and psychosocial challenges which may be more common for women including stigma, intimate partner violence, depression, legal, and childcare needs. Interdisciplinary team-based care is also important in ensuring continuity of care, ideally integrated at the site of her HIV care. </p><p>Despite efforts to increase access and utilization of care, HIV-infected women continue to receive lower quality of care, even after adjusting for potential confounders, including race and HIV transmission risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/5,18,21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,21,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">GENDER-RELATED BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral load differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While gender-based differences in access and receipt of care exist, biological differences also exist. A natural cohort study of 812 specimens from 650 injection drug users (IDU) identified differences in viral load measurements between men and women; women had lower viral loads compared to men after controlling for CD4 counts (3365 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> versus 8907 by branched DNA assay and 45,416 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> versus 93,130 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The time to the development of AIDS was not different between the sexes. Another way to look at this is that women had a 1.6-fold increased risk of progressing to AIDS compared with men with the same viral load and CD4 cell count.</p><p>Many other studies have also found this gender-based difference in viral loads, with no difference in overall mortality; the difference appears to be occurring primarily in the years following seroconversion. One group found significantly lower viral loads at seroconversion in women compared with men (15,103 versus 50,766 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> respectively) without differences in CD4 cell count. Initial viral load was a predictor of HIV progression for men but not for women, with women rapid progressors having a median initial viral load of 17,149 compared with 77,822 for male progressors.</p><p>A review of 9 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal studies, which included viral load measurements in males and females, women had greater than twofold lower levels of HIV RNA than men, despite controlling for CD4 counts and time from seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although the initial level of HIV RNA was lower in women than in men, the rates of disease progression appear similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of primary HIV infection are similar in women and men. However, a study looking at sex-based differences at the time of seroconversion from Kenya found that women were more likely to be infected with diverse variants of HIV, even at the time of initial infection in comparison to men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Viral isolates were obtained during primary HIV infection and prior to seroconversion in both men and women. Both groups had similar frequency of sexual intercourse and sexually transmitted diseases. The difference was quite striking; 20 of 32 women had multiple variants of the virus compared to 0 of 10 for the men, although the clinical significance of this finding and impact on viral load at seroconversion remains unknown at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS IN WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is the most common AIDS-defining infection in women and men, and advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/mm3)</span> is the most common AIDS-defining condition in both populations. Rates of other OIs do not differ with a few exceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) remains more common in men in the United States, probably related to a higher prevalence of coinfection with the etiologic agent, human herpesvirus type 8. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-associations-of-human-herpesvirus-8-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease associations of human herpesvirus 8 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study of 107 patients with KS in a large municipal hospital, 11 percent were women; birth outside of the United States was a significant risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Women with KS tended to present with more advanced and extensive disease, possibly related to delay in diagnosis.</p><p>A number of cohort studies have reported a higher incidence of Candida esophagitis in HIV-infected women. Some studies have also found increased rates of bacterial infections and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/16,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31</a>].</p><p>For many women, gynecologic complaints are the initial manifestation of <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span>.

It is also a common condition in women without HIV infection. One prospective study found a higher incidence and persistence but not severity of Candida vaginitis among HIV-infected women compared to women at risk for HIV who did not have the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Treatment is generally topical unless the infection does not respond or recurs frequently. Systemic treatment and suppression with imidazoles are effective, although long-term use can lead to colonization with resistant Candida species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. One study in 323 HIV-infected women with CD4 counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;300/mm3</span> found that intermittent suppression with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (200 mg PO once weekly) was effective as suppressive therapy without a high risk of resistance (under 5 percent in both the treatment group and control patients not receiving therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Weekly fluconazole prevented both vaginal and oropharyngeal candidiasis but not esophageal candidiasis. However, the need for preventive therapy has declined with the advent of more potent and durable ART regimens.</p><p>Other reasons for apparent treatment failure or breakthrough include a second etiologic agent (see below) and noninfectious conditions. These other diagnoses can be made after appropriate pelvic examination and cultures of vaginal and cervical discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial vaginosis, genital ulcers, and pelvic inflammatory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other gynecologic infections also occur in women with HIV.</p><p>Bacterial vaginosis may result in recurrent vaginal discharge. A prospective cohort study conducted over a five-year period found that bacterial vaginosis was both more prevalent and more persistent among HIV-infected women compared to those without HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. HIV-infected women with CD4 cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL</span> were more likely to have both persistent and severe bacterial vaginosis than those with CD4 counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;500/microL</span>.

Bacterial vaginosis may also be a risk factor for HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In comparison, genital HSV infections are increased in frequency and severity in women with HIV.

Early in the epidemic, one study reported that HIV-positive women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) presented with fewer signs of acute infection, were more likely to have a delayed response to treatment, and more frequently required surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, a third prospective study of 207 women with PID (44 with HIV infection and 163 without) found no differences between HIV-infected and uninfected women in severity of symptoms or response to therapy, regardless of CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Although early studies reported that Papanicolaou (Pap) smears had low sensitivity for detection of cervical lesions in HIV-infected women, subsequent data have shown similar performance as in HIV-uninfected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. However, even mildly abnormal cytology is a potential sign of cervical neoplasia and an indication for colposcopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the approach to cervical cancer screening jointly recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Health (NIH), and HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) differs by age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIV-infected women &lt;30 years old</strong> &mdash; Cervical cancer screening should begin within one year of start of sexual activity and no later than 21 years of age. For women who enter into HIV care more than one year after their sexual debut or at age &ge;21 years, cancer screening should be performed as part of the initial evaluation. The Pap test is the main screening modality for this age group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the initial Pap test is normal, the Pap test should be repeated at 12 months (an additional test at 6 months is also reasonable) and, if that is normal, then annually.

If HPV-positive, colposcopy is recommended. If HPV-negative or unavailable, the Pap is repeated every 6 to 12 months. Repeat ASCUS or worse cytology should be evaluated further by colposcopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a Pap test demonstrates low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse, colposcopy is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIV-infected women &ge;30 years old</strong> &mdash; Cervical cancer screening is performed as part of the initial HIV evaluation and continues through the woman's lifetime.

If the Pap is normal but HPV is positive for the high-risk types 16 or 18, colposcopy is recommended. If the Pap is normal but HPV is positive for types other than 16 or 18, both tests are repeated at 12 months. Colposcopy is recommended if either the Pap is abnormal or the repeat HPV test shows high-risk types.</p><p/><p>HIV-infected women who have had a hysterectomy, particularly with a history of cervical dysplasia, should also undergo regular cytologic screening with Pap smears of the vaginal cuff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p>This approach to cervical screening is similar in some ways to that in uninfected women (eg, option to use HPV co-testing in women &ge;30 years old); the main differences include the starting time for screening, the interval for follow-up after normal Pap plus HPV tests, and the continuation of lifelong screening rather than stopping at age 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The utility of HPV testing in HIV-infected women was illustrated by a study that demonstrated that the rate of squamous intraepithelial lesions following a negative HPV test was similarly low among HIV-infected women with CD4 cell counts &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and HIV-uninfected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Conversely, a positive high-risk HPV test is associated with an elevated risk for cervical dysplasia, even if the initial Pap is negative. As an example, in a study that included over 1000 HIV-infected women with a baseline normal Pap, among the 24 women who tested positive for HPV type 16, the five-year cumulative risk for CIN 2 or worse was 29 percent, in contrast to 2 to 4 percent among women who tested negative for a high-risk HPV type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>HPV testing is not used routinely in women &lt;30 years old because of a high prevalence of HPV infection in this age group, but is important in the context of ASCUS as noted above.</p><p>As above, colposcopy should be performed for HIV-infected women with abnormal cytology on screening, including the repeated finding of ASCUS or high-risk HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. The appropriate management of abnormal cervical cytology and neoplasia, including optimal ablative therapy, role of postablative treatment with topical agents, and timing and method of follow-up, is still largely unknown. However, close follow-up by a provider with experience in HIV-related cervical disease is essential.</p><p>Prevention of HPV-associated disease through HPV vaccination is also an important aspect of care of HIV-infected young women.

The following sections discuss the considerations specific to HIV infection and treatment.</p><p>Women should be counseled that HIV can be transmitted even when the HIV-infected person has a very low HIV viral load. Due to the risk of HIV and other STI transmission, a form of barrier contraception is always recommended. Other factors may also influence a woman's choice of contraception, including whether she has been able to disclose her HIV status, fear of domestic violence, and other medical conditions. The best practice is dual contraception with a hormonal agent to prevent pregnancy and condoms to reduce the transmission of the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal contraceptives (eg, oral, injectable) are effective reversible agents for the prevention of pregnancy in women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While reliability does not appear to be reduced by HIV infection, efficacy can be compromised by drug interactions between estrogen and certain antiretroviral agents and other medications commonly used in individuals with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>] including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (specifically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protease inhibitors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medications (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>) that may be needed to treat HIV-related complications or comorbidities </p><p/><p>In particular, certain protease inhibitors (including ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a> and <span class=\"nowrap\">lopinavir/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>)</span> decrease ethinyl estradiol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> levels; alternative or additional contraceptive methods should be used for patients taking these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Efavirenz</a> has also been implicated in significant drug interactions with certain hormonal contraceptives, in particular progestin-releasing implants (both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> and etonogestrel), resulting in decreased contraceptive efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>]. In a prospective study of HIV-infected women in Uganda who received a levonorgestrel implant, levonorgestrel levels were lower and unintended pregnancies were higher among the 20 women who were on an efavirenz-containing ART regimen compared with the 20 on a nevirapine-containing regimen and 17 ART-na&iuml;ve women (three versus zero unintended pregnancies within 48 weeks of follow-up) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Similarly, in a large retrospective study in Kenya, the adjusted pregnancy incidence among over 6000 women using progestin-releasing implants was three times higher in those using an efavirenz- versus nevirapine-based regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Nevertheless, the adjusted pregnancy rate with concomitant efavirenz use and progestin-releasing implants remained lower compared with other forms of contraception apart from intrauterine devices or permanent methods, regardless of ART regimen used. In the United States, efavirenz-based regimens are no longer preferred regimens for treatment initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-women/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In settings where equally effective non-efavirenz-containing regimens are not available, an additional or alternative form of birth control with equal efficacy should be used for women on efavirenz-containing regimens. This challenge highlights the need for better ART regimens for women of child-bearing age, as well as alternate strategies for long-acting contraceptive agents.</p><p>Providers are cautioned to check for new information as research continues.

Acceptance of male condom use may be limited by fear of disclosure, refusal by the partner and many other issues.
