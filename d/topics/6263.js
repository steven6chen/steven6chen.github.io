The estimated ten-year survival rate for all primary CNS tumors is approximately 70 percent in patients &le;19 years of age, resulting in approximately 26,000 children living in the United States with a CNS tumor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, accounting for approximately 20 percent of all childhood malignancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99680 \">table 1</a>), and are the leading cause of cancer death in children 0 through 14 years. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS tumors are classified according to histology and molecular parameters. The most common tumor types in children include gliomas (particularly pilocytic astrocytomas) and medulloblastomas. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70767 \">figure 1</a>). The distribution varies with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61480\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61480 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'WHO classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location of the tumor impacts the clinical presentation. Brain tumors account for approximately 90 percent of all CNS tumors, and the remaining CNS tumors are found in the spinal cord and cranial nerves. Approximately one-third to one-half of CNS tumors in children are located in the posterior fossa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81514\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81514 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Distribution by site'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the etiology of most childhood CNS tumors remains unknown, two established risk factors for the development of a CNS tumor in children include exposure to ionizing radiation and genetic predisposition.
