The etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder are unknown, although data indicate that a significant central sensitization component is at the root of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is characterized by chronic and diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and nonrestorative sleep, as well as a number of other typical symptoms that may vary from patient to patient. Initially described in adults, this disorder is often seen in children and adolescents and is also referred to as juvenile primary fibromyalgia when it occurs in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. The treatment and outcome of juvenile fibromyalgia and the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia in children and adolescents are controversial.</p><p>Several different classification schema have been proposed in adults. The most frequently used diagnostic criteria were published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990, and preliminary revised criteria were suggested in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The ACR criteria include widespread pain for at least three months duration and the presence of at least 11 tender points at 18 potential sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79179 \">table 1</a>). The original criteria were based upon the evaluation of 293 adult patients (mean age of 44.7 years), and the subsequent criteria were based upon evaluation of 196 patients with current fibromyalgia and 67 patients with prior fibromyalgia (mean age of 54.6 years). At no juncture has the application of these criteria to children been validated. A 2014 review makes clear that little progress has been made in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In 1985, criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia in children were published based upon a review of 33 children (mean age 14.7 years, range 9 to 17 years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69755 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These criteria (referred to as the Yunus criteria) differ from those of the ACR 1990 criteria in requiring fewer tender points (5 versus 11), as well as clinical findings beyond diffuse pain. The other major clinical findings include the absence of another underlying condition or cause and normal laboratory test results.</p><p>In our clinical practice, we use the Yunus criteria to diagnose children with fibromyalgia because children can often have all the cardinal symptoms of fibromyalgia, but may not necessarily have the number of tender points required by the ACR criteria. In fact, it is generally thought that fibromyalgia in children may occur with fewer tender points.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic variability makes reliable estimates difficult to ascertain, but limited data suggest that the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome in children and adolescents is between 1 and 2 percent.</p><p>Three illustrative examples that used the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for diagnosis are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based study of 2408 Israeli children aged 8 to 21 years, 1.2 percent met the criteria for fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of 548 Mexican children aged 9 to 17 years found fibromyalgia in 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 1756 third and fifth graders in Finland, the prevalence of fibromyalgia was 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>In a retrospective, cohort study of 2595 cases (both adults and children) identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses from a large, stable health insurance claims database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], the estimated rates of fibromyalgia among males and females based upon age were 0.5 and 1 percent for zero to four year olds, 1 and 1.4 percent for five to nine year olds, 2 and 2.6 percent for 10 to 14 year olds, and 3.5 and 6.2 percent for 15 to 19 year olds, respectively. These data should be viewed with some skepticism, however, as the rigor of the diagnosis was not evaluated. In addition, the data regarding children less than four years of age is much higher than what would be expected as fibromyalgia is thought to be almost nonexistent in this age group.</p><p>The age of onset of fibromyalgia is typically in the early adolescent years. Several studies have noted a mean age of onset ranging from 11.5 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14-17</a>].</p><p>Patients with fibromyalgia account for approximately 7 percent of all cases referred to tertiary pediatric rheumatology centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. There is a strong female predominance in the pediatric population, similar to that seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the etiology of fibromyalgia remains unknown, it is considered to be a disorder of pain regulation, classified often under the term &quot;central sensitization&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One widely accepted hypothesis is that fibromyalgia is a disorder of pain regulation due to neuroendocrinologic changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems, which occurs in genetically susceptible individuals, possibly in response to environmental triggers. This results in heightened pain perception and hypersensitivity to numerous stimuli.</p><p>The following is a summary of the data that support this mechanism of central sensitization. They are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased incidence of fibromyalgia in first-degree relatives of patients with this condition supports genetic susceptibility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in pain processing with increased levels of pain mediators and increased activation of pain-sensitive areas of the brain as detected by magnetic resonance imaging are observed in patients with fibromyalgia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurohumoral abnormalities are observed in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at baseline and after provocative testing in patients with fibromyalgia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep and mood disturbances are noted in the majority of patients, suggesting underlying central nervous system dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (eg, orthostatic hypotension) is seen more frequently in patients with fibromyalgia compared with the normal population.</p><p/><p>There is evidence that small-fiber polyneuropathy underlies fibromyalgia in some patients, but these data are preliminary, and additional systematic research is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the relationship between fibromyalgia syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) continues to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Lastly, genetic polymorphisms in various pain and neurochemical pathways have been identified in some series of patients with fibromyalgia and have been suggested as risk factors for the development of this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-fibromyalgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is increasing recognition that fibromyalgia may occur in patients with other diagnosed rheumatologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fibromyalgia may also co-occur with a number of other syndromes, including migraine headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], temporomandibular joint disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and gynecologic concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed previously, fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic, widespread pain and the presence of tender points. Other common symptoms include fatigue, headache, depressed mood, and disturbed sleep. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p>The following case series illustrate these findings and their frequency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series from the United States of 59 children with juvenile fibromyalgia diagnosed at a mean age of 15.5 years, the following symptoms and their frequency were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diffuse pain &ndash; 97 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Headaches &ndash; 76 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleep disturbances &ndash; 69 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stiffness &ndash; 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subjective joint swelling &ndash; 24 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fatigue &ndash; 20 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series from the United States of 45 patients, similar rates of diffuse pain (&gt;90 percent) and headaches (71 percent) were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, there was a higher incidence of sleep disturbances (&gt;90 percent), fatigue (62 percent), and morning stiffness (53 percent) than in the above cohort.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardinal manifestation of fibromyalgia is diffuse musculoskeletal pain involving the arms, legs, back, and neck. Not all parts of the body may be affected simultaneously, but it is important to recognize that this is not a local phenomenon. Affected patients frequently say, &quot;I hurt all over.&quot;</p><p>The pain may be described as an ache or an achy feeling, but terms as varied as &quot;dull,&quot; &quot;sharp,&quot; &quot;shooting,&quot; &quot;excruciating,&quot; and &quot;burning&quot; also are used by patients to describe the pain. It is usually constant and chronic, not intermittent, and may vary in intensity. It may wake patients from sleep, but, as a rule, the disturbed sleep characteristic of fibromyalgia is not caused by pain.</p><p>Although patients may describe joint pain and stiffness, they will also complain of pain and aching in the muscles, one characteristic that distinguishes fibromyalgia from arthritis. In addition, patients with fibromyalgia do not have swollen or inflamed joints on physical examination, although many will describe subjective perception of joint swelling. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In both Yunus' [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] criteria for fibromyalgia, chronic pain is a required finding, with the ACR definition specifying a minimum duration of three months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79179 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69755 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tender points</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second major finding in patients with fibromyalgia is the presence of multiple tender points. These are highly localized areas of the body (&quot;points&quot;) that are consistently sensitive to pressure. Palpation of these specific tender points in patients with fibromyalgia usually elicits pain causing a significant reaction in the patient, such as wincing and a withdrawal response. Palpation of &quot;control&quot; points should also be included. These points should not be tender, or at least should be less tender than the fibromyalgia tender points. Patients are usually not aware of the presence of the tender points as areas that are particularly painful. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although a total of 24 tender points have been identified, only 18 have been found to be reliable for use in the ACR criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79397 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Yunus and other investigators have found that the diagnosis of fibromyalgia in children requires fewer tender points than the number needed to diagnose adults according to the ACR definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31-35</a>]. Another set of criteria for the clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia that do not require a tender point examination was approved by the ACR in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These criteria, which require a widespread pain index &gt;7 and a score of &gt;5 on a symptom severity (SS) scale, recognize the limitations of the 1990 ACR criteria and present a simple but preliminary case definition that was able to correctly classify 88 percent of cases identified by the ACR classification criteria. These criteria have not been tested in children.</p><p>The optimal threshold for the number of tender points needed to diagnose both children and adults with fibromyalgia remains uncertain. The ACR criteria were based upon the greatest differentiation of cumulative tender points between the 293 adult patients with fibromyalgia and 265 controls. This number was not validated in a subsequent prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and, in fact, reports in adults using fewer tender points than the ACR criteria have demonstrated greater diagnostic sensitivity without a significant loss of specificity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of tender points in the absence of chronic pain does not appear to be predictive of later development of fibromyalgia in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In summary, the exact number of tender points present in a child with possible fibromyalgia is probably not as important in making the diagnosis of juvenile fibromyalgia as whether the child's constellation of symptoms is consistent with the diagnosis (ie, persistent chronic pain), provided that no other disease process is evident. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is a common and key complaint in children with fibromyalgia, which is similar to adults with this disorder. In the previously mentioned case series, Yunus found that 91 percent of his patients suffered from fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence of fatigue in other series of children with fibromyalgia has ranged from as little as 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] to 80 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frequent headaches occur in a majority of patients with fibromyalgia. The reported incidence ranges from 55 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,32,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32,37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep disturbance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disturbed or interrupted sleep occurs in at least two-thirds of children with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,31,33,34,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31,33,34,39</a>]. Patients most often describe difficulty in falling asleep. Despite complaints of severe fatigue, these children often take an hour or more to fall asleep. Even when they do fall asleep, many have difficulty maintaining sleep and wake up during the night. There may be overlap with restless legs syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Nonrestorative sleep (feeling tired or exhausted even after getting a full night's sleep) is a common complaint in children with fibromyalgia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children often suffer from fibromyalgia for many months, sometimes years, before the diagnosis is made. As a consequence, their day-to-day life may be greatly disrupted. Standardized measures can be used to assess the impact of juvenile fibromyalgia on function and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Some children with fibromyalgia sleep during the day after not being able to sleep at night because of sleep disturbances. School attendance is often inconsistent or poor, or the child is switched to home schooling. Enabling these dysfunctional children to improve adaptive functioning and to attend school regularly should be primary goals for the family and the healthcare provider.</p><p>In addition, dietary habits may deteriorate, and many patients fail to participate in any form of exercise and become deconditioned. This may perpetuate the cycle of pain.

A small percentage of patients may have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), but this likely reflects the underlying presence of incidental positive ANA tests in the general population.

This pain is usually accompanied by hyperalgesia and allodynia (severe pain with even light stroking of the skin of the affected area), edema, and changes in color or temperature of the affected limb. These changes may be subtle early in the disease process or extreme, with severe atrophy and trophic changes of the skin, hair, and nails and significant dysfunction of involved muscles and joints. Like fibromyalgia, CRPS occurs more frequently in females than males and is much more common in adolescents than in younger children.</p><p>Patients with CRPS are easily distinguished from patients with fibromyalgia because they have localized pain (compared with the vague diffuse pain that occurs in many parts of the body in fibromyalgia), and they usually do not have tender points. In addition, sleep disturbance, fatigue, headaches, and other features of fibromyalgia are not cardinal features of CRPS.

Growing pains typically affect both legs and sometimes the arms and other areas of the body, almost always occur at the end of an active day or in the middle of the night, and may wake a child at night.</p><p>Children with growing pains are easily distinguished from patients with fibromyalgia because they have localized rather than diffuse pain; their pain is intermittent, only occurs at night, is self-limited rather than chronic and persistent, and is not characterized by tender points; and they do not have other associated symptoms. Growing pains are also far more likely to be relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

However, at times, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> can have diffuse pain in addition to severe fatigue, indicating possible overlap between <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> and fibromyalgia. In one study of 27 adolescents with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> eight patients also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Not surprisingly, patients with fibromyalgia also had more muscle pain, neurologic symptoms, and sleep disturbances than the other patients in the study. A more recent study indicates a possible common immunological pathogenesis between the two syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatic diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and other rheumatic diseases are usually easily differentiated from fibromyalgia because of the presence of objective physical findings and laboratory abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rheumatic disease most commonly confused with fibromyalgia is JIA because the symptoms of musculoskeletal pain and joint stiffness are quite similar in the two diseases. Patients with fibromyalgia will often have joint tenderness and pain on motion of the joint, which may be confused with the inflammatory synovitis of JIA. However, they will also have tenderness of the muscles in areas away from the joints, have tender points, and will lack the objective signs of synovitis that occur in patients with arthritis. In addition, the presence of back pain is not as common in most children with JIA, although it can occur in children with certain types of arthritis, specifically enthesitis-related arthritis (or spondyloarthropathy).</p><p>As a note of caution, fibromyalgia can occur or develop in children with rheumatic diseases such as JIA and SLE, so it is possible for patients to have both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibromyalgia-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].
