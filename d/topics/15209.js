Acute wounds in normal, healthy individuals heal through an orderly sequence of physiological events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The overlapping intricacy of the wound healing pathway serves to prevent a single primary factor from disrupting the process. As examples, local tissue ischemia and neuropathy can impair chemotaxis during the hemostasis and inflammatory stages, tissue necrosis and infection alter the balance of inflammation and compete for oxygen, and uncontrolled periwound edema and wound instability disrupt myofibroblast activity, collagen deposition, and cross-linking. Impaired wound healing often occurs in the setting of multiple, smaller contributing issues to stall the healing process; however, infection or ischemia alone can impair wound healing. </p><p>When the healing process is stalled, a chronic wound may develop, and this is more likely to occur in patients with underlying medical disorders. Chronic ulceration commonly affects the lower extremities with a prevalence that ranges between 0.18 and 1.3 percent in the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The most common nonhealing wounds affecting the lower extremities are associated with chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/1,2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3845567735\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors associated with impaired wound healing leading to wound healing complications or chronic nonhealing wounds are listed and discussed in more detail in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/1,2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,7</a>]. The discussion of the more common factors assumes that nothing else is specifically contributing to acute local inflammation, such as a retained foreign body. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1077172852\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H179550987\" class=\"local\">'Smoking and nicotine replacement therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aging &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H2939164374\" class=\"local\">'Aging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malnutrition &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1310512405\" class=\"local\">'Malnutrition'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobilization &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1182403319\" class=\"local\">'Immobilization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H4117234763\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular disease &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1692646279\" class=\"local\">'Vascular disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H3335555110\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H2036692822\" class=\"local\">'Less common factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1077172852\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of infection impairs several steps of the wound healing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bacteria produce inflammatory mediators that inhibit the inflammatory phase of wound healing and prevent epithelialization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Infection also results in cellular death, which will increase the local inflammatory environment. New tissue growth also cannot occur in the presence of necrotic tissue. This might also result in a pathologic cycle as the presence of necrotic tissue additionally serves as a nidus for bacterial proliferation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H778993556\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical site infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical site infection (SSI) is defined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as infection related to an operative procedure that occurs at or near the surgical incision within 30 days of the procedure or within 90 days if prosthetic material is implanted at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. SSIs are often localized to the incision site but can also extend into deeper adjacent structures. </p><p>It is estimated that SSI develops in 2 to 5 percent of patients undergoing inpatient surgical procedures each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. SSIs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. Among patients with SSIs who die in the postoperative period, death can be related to the wound infection in over 75 percent of cases. SSI rates in ambulatory surgical settings are relatively low; one study reported overall rates at 14 and 30 days of 3.1 and 4.8 per 1000 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nonteaching hospitals generally have lower rates of SSI compared with small (&lt;500 beds) or large (&gt;500 beds) teaching hospitals (4.6 versus 6.4 and 8.2 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk for SSI in the immediate postoperative period may differ from that following discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>The risk of SSI for individual procedures varies widely. The highest rates occur after abdominal surgery: small bowel surgery (5.3 to 10.6 percent), colon surgery (4.3 to 10.5 percent), gastric surgery (2.8 to 12.3 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">liver/pancreas</span> surgery (2.8 to 10.2 percent), exploratory laparotomy (1.9 to 6.9 percent), and appendectomy (1.3 to 3.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other representative rates are as follows: coronary bypass surgery (3.3 to 3.7 percent), Caesarian section (3.4 to 4.4 percent), vascular surgery (1.3 to 5.2 percent), joint prosthesis (0.7 to 1.7 percent), and spinal fusion (1.3 to 3.1 percent). Eye surgery is associated with an extremely low rate of SSI (0.14 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4099501690\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether an SSI occurs depends upon a complex interaction between numerous factors, including the nature and number of organisms contaminating the surgical site, antimicrobial prophylaxis, the health of the patient, and the technique of the surgeon. Measures to prevent surgical site infection are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many of the factors identified as risk factors for SSI are also associated with impaired wound healing (eg, cigarette smoking, older age, obesity, malnutrition, diabetes, immunosuppressive therapy); these are discussed in the accompanying sections below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The presence of recent infection at the surgical site or remotely, recent surgery, and hospitalization are also important. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3940540290\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical wound classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of contamination of a surgical wound at the time of the operation is an important risk factor for infection and can be classified using the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) wound class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], which is based upon an adaptation of the American College of Surgeons surgical wound classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean &ndash; An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tracts are not entered. In addition, clean wounds are primarily closed and, if necessary, drained with closed drainage. Operative incisional wounds that follow nonpenetrating (blunt) trauma should be included in this category if they meet the criteria. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean-Contaminated &ndash; Operative wounds in which the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts are entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection or major break in technique is encountered. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contaminated &ndash; Open, fresh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations with major breaks in sterile technique (eg, open cardiac massage) or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract and incisions in which acute, nonpurulent inflammation is encountered, including necrotic tissue without evidence of purulent drainage (eg, dry gangrene), are included in this category. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dirty or Infected<strong> </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Includes old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera. This definition suggests that the organisms causing postoperative infection were present in the operative field before the operation. </p><p/><p>Procedure-specific risk factors identified in a logistic regression model using data from the NHSN generally outperform the traditional NHSN risk index based on wound classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The NHSN has made its risk adjustment models and methods available for participating hospitals via its web tool calculations of the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR). Several of the procedure-specific risk adjustment models offer only raw or minimally adjusted risk calculations due to the lack of statistically significant predictor variables in the existing NHSN database. Other risk adjustment models have been published by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179550987\"><span class=\"h1\">SMOKING AND NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking is associated with adverse outcomes following surgery, including surgical site infection and pulmonary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Pulmonary complications and recommendations on smoking cessation and nicotine replacement therapy are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Smoking cessation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The constituents of tobacco smoke and mechanisms responsible for the vasoactive and other effects of smoking have not been fully elucidated; for many years, nicotine was presumed to be responsible, but other constituents of tobacco smoke may have a greater impact. Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of compounds (eg, nicotine, carbon monoxide, tar, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, N-nitrosamines, formaldehyde, benzene), several of which have a physiological impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. The detrimental effect of smoking on wound healing is multifactorial, with mechanisms that include vasoconstriction causing a relative ischemia of operated tissues, a reduced inflammatory response, impaired bacteriocidal mechanisms, and alterations of collagen metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These are postulated to impair wound healing and cause wound dehiscence and incisional hernia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing#H4011539621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;, section on 'Wound healing'</a>.) </p><p>Smoking is associated with postoperative wound healing complications, which occur more often in smokers compared with nonsmokers as well as in former smokers compared with those who never smoked. A systematic review identified four randomized trials that evaluated the impact of preoperative smoking cessation (four- to eight-week interval of abstinence) on postoperative wound healing. Preoperative smoking cessation significantly reduced the incidence of surgical site infection (odds ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.83) but did not impact the incidence of other postoperative wound complications (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.19-1.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a separate study, current or past smoking was associated with an increased risk for postoperative infection (OR 1.9, CI 1.0-3.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Although smoking-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by nicotine, can reduce blood flow by up to 40 percent, the effect appears to be temporary, with tissue blood flow and oxygen levels restored to normal levels within 45 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. Most tissues with an adequate blood supply probably tolerate these transient alterations; however, tissue flaps, which have a fragile blood supply, and other ischemic tissues (eg, moderate-to-severe peripheral artery disease) may be vulnerable to smoking-induced reductions in blood flow. With respect to other effects of nicotine, both impaired and stimulated wound healing have been identified in experimental studies; however, no clinically significant detrimental or beneficial effects on wound healing have been demonstrated with the use of nicotine replacement therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/44-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2939164374\"><span class=\"h1\">AGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin is not excluded from the complex processes of aging. The supply of cutaneous nerves and blood vessels decreases with age, in addition to a general thinning of tissue, including dermis and basement membrane. There is a progressive loss of collagen and diminished ability to produce more collagen. These physiologic changes associated with aging contribute to slowed or impaired wound healing in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>In several studies, the extremes of age (infants and older individuals) were identified as a risk factor for surgical site infection (SSI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. One cohort study of more than 144,000 adult surgical patients found that increasing age independently predicted an increased risk of SSI only until age 65 years (risk increasing 1.1 percent per year between 17 and 65 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. At age &ge;65 years, increasing age independently predicted a decreased risk of SSI (risk decreased 1.2 percent for each additional year). The decreased risk of SSI in patients &ge;65 years may reflect selection bias (frail older adult patients are more likely to forego surgery). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1310512405\"><span class=\"h1\">MALNUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is insufficient evidence that nutritional supplementation helps wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>], adequate nutrition is imperative for the prevention of infection, which has deleterious effects on wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1077172852\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;, section on 'Consequences of malnutrition in surgical patients'</a>.) </p><p>Thus, we prefer to screen for malnourishment by obtaining preoperative serum prealbumin and albumin levels and monitoring them to optimize nutritional status. Prealbumin and albumin are not perfect markers of nutritional status; however, these should be obtained on patients with nonhealing wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1182403319\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMOBILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing periods of prolonged immobilization, particularly those with spinal cord disease, are at an increased risk for the development of chronic wounds. These are typically pressure wounds, similar in pathogenesis and appearance to neuropathic wounds occurring in areas of bony prominence such as the sacrum, knees, ankle malleoli, and heels. The sacrum may be particularly at risk when the presence of incontinence in spinal cord patients leads to a moist environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

In fact, complete immobilization with total contact casting is an effective treatment for plantar diabetic foot ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3335555110\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic immunosuppression is a risk factor for wound healing delay and nonhealing, particularly in the clinical situations of organ transplantation and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3463049181\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids may not have the same degree of negative effect as other immunosuppressive therapies, and locally applied topical steroids are often used in the treatment of chronic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. While some degree of anti-inflammation may prevent wounds from becoming arrested in the inflammatory stage, significant suppression of inflammation can prevent wounds from progressing into the next stages of wound healing. This is a subjective and currently unquantifiable inflammatory balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of topical steroid application in the treatment of chronic wounds, particularly when an abnormal and uncontrolled inflammatory stage is suspected within the stages of wound healing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1422148708\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of chemotherapy may have a detrimental effect on wound healing, specifically through its effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is an important factor contributing to angiogenesis during the early stages of wound healing but may also be an important regulator in malignancy and thus is a target of cancer therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p>Similar to these effects, any patient on immunosuppressive therapy is at an increased risk for the development of chronic wounds and wound infection. The inflammatory phase of wound healing may be blunted in patients on long-term immune suppression such as is used in treating transplant patients and HIV patients, among others. </p><p>Furthermore, neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy can produce loss of protective sensation and instability in a similar manner to diabetes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3543456663\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy has evolved as a powerful tool for tumor control as a sole therapy or administered adjunctively. More than 50 percent of cancer patients receive some form of radiation treatment, and, despite improvements in radiation technique, radiation-induced injury still contributes to poor wound healing. </p><p>The term &quot;radiation injury&quot; refers to the morphologic and functional changes that can occur in noncancerous tissue as a direct result of ionizing radiation and may include apoptosis (cell death) with low doses of radiation or outright tissue necrosis with higher doses of radiation. Irradiated skin in the chronic stage is thin, hypovascular, extremely painful, and easily injured by slight trauma or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Skin ulcers due to radiation injury are more commonly delayed in presentation and are due to ischemic tissue changes. Characteristic features of delayed radiation injury include telangiectasia and eccentric myointimal proliferation in the small arteries and arterioles. The proliferative changes may progress to obstruction, or the lumen may thrombose. These ulcers heal very slowly and may persist for several years. </p><p>Given the changes that are known to occur with respect to the perfusion of irradiated tissue and the phases of wound healing, surgical incisions in these locations are more likely to develop a wound complication. If an incision is planned in an area of radiation exposure, the optimal timing for surgery remains unclear. While some have recommended waiting three to six weeks after radiation therapy to perform an incision or conversely to delay radiation therapy three to four weeks after an incision, surgery in the immediate perioperative period has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. It is likely that the dosing and duration of radiation therapy affects this decision making, preventing the ability to make generalized recommendations; each case needs to be individualized. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4117234763\"><span class=\"h1\">DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous cytologic factors contribute to impaired wound healing in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. These include decreased or impaired growth factor production, angiogenic response, macrophage function, collagen accumulation, epidermal barrier function, quantity of granulation tissue, keratinocyte and fibroblast migration and proliferation, number of epidermal nerves, bone healing, and abnormal balance between the accumulation of extracellular matrix components and their remodeling by matrix metalloproteinases. </p><p>Diabetes is a particularly important risk factor for the development of chronic wounds from neuropathy and vasculopathy, which increase the risk of infection and delay healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/8,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,75</a>]. Diabetes is frequently associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with atherosclerosis developing at a younger age and affecting more distal arteries (eg, popliteal, tibial arteries). Peripheral artery disease in combination with diabetic neuropathy contributes to higher rates of nonhealing wounds and limb loss in diabetic patients compared with those without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].

Peripheral artery obstruction is present in approximately 20 percent of these patients and diabetic neuropathy in up to 50 percent of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/71,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,75</a>]. </p><p>Neuropathy alone can be responsible for the development of diabetic foot ulcers. Neuropathy associated with diabetes affects sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves. Sensory neuropathy diminishes the perception of pain that is protective when tissue injury has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Patients with diabetes may not be aware of the injury, particularly if the injured region cannot be seen or if the patient has a visual impairment. The motor nerves to the intrinsic muscles of the foot are affected in approximately 50 percent of patients with diabetes, resulting in claw deformities in the digits that transfer pressure to the plantar metatarsal heads. Increased local tissue pressure on the plantar surface or in other regions where bony deformities contact the shoe may lead to skin erosion and ulceration that may go unnoticed in patients with sensory deficits. In addition, autonomic neuropathy causes the skin to become dry and susceptible to skin fissures, tearing, and infection due to a loss of sweat and oil gland function. Loss of vascular tone may lead to foot edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-impaired-wound-healing-and-wound-complications/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Wounds may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including acute injury (abrasion, puncture, crush), surgery, or other factors that cause breakdown of previously intact skin (eg, ischemia, pressure). There is no specific time frame that distinguishes between acute and chronic wounds. Impaired wound healing and the development of chronic wounds are associated with physiologic derangements that alter the normal wound healing process. (See <a href=\"#H1590585254\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many disease states alter the process of wound healing, the most common of which are diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and chronic venous disease. Small vessel arterial diseases are also associated with the development of skin ulcers and poor wound healing due to vascular obstruction or vascular thrombosis. Other factors that contribute to skin or surgical wound breakdown and nonhealing ulcers include smoking, aging, malnutrition, immobilization, and immunosuppressive therapies, including radiation therapy, edema, and obesity. (See <a href=\"#H3845567735\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among surgical patients, surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common type of nosocomial infection and are associated with impaired wound healing and surgical site breakdown, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) risk index can be useful for predicting the risk of infection in surgical patients. However, whether an SSI occurs depends upon a complex interaction between numerous factors, including the nature and number of organisms contaminating the surgical site, use of appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis and other preventive measures, the health of the patient, and the technique of the surgeon, as well as the other factors discussed above that increase the risk for impaired wound healing.
