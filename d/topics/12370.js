It may be due to a structural or motility abnormality in the passage of solids or liquids from the oral cavity to the stomach. Patients' complaints range from the inability to initiate a swallow to the sensation of solids or liquids being hindered during their passage through the esophagus into the stomach.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of patients with dysphagia and diagnostic testing in patients with esophageal dysphagia.

Esophageal dysphagia arises within the body of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter, or cardia. A large number of conditions are associated with esophageal dysphagia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80528 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H802823703\"><span class=\"h2\">Characterizing the symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysphagia should be characterized according to types of food that produce symptoms, the time course (ie, progressive or intermittent), and associated symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70866\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70866 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Solid, liquid, or both?</strong>&mdash;A critical component of the medical history is determining the types of food that produce symptoms (ie, solids, liquids, or both). For example, dysphagia to both solids and liquids from the onset of symptoms is probably due to a motility disorder of the esophagus. Dysphagia to solids only is usually present when the esophageal lumen is narrowed to 13 mm or less by a stricture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progressive or intermittent?</strong>&mdash;It is important to ask if the symptoms are intermittent or are gradually progressive. Progressive dysphagia, beginning with dysphagia to solids followed by dysphagia to liquids, is usually caused by a peptic stricture or obstructing lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Symptoms of peptic stricture are slowly and gradually progressive, whereas those due to a malignancy progress more rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intermittent dysphagia may be related to a lower esophageal ring or web.

Patients with peptic strictures usually have a history of heartburn and regurgitation but no weight loss, while patients with esophageal cancer tend to be older males with significant weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This benign esophageal stricture is usually found in close proximity to the esophagogastric junction. The development of peptic strictures among patients with reflux has been associated with older age, male sex, and longer duration of reflux symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Peptic strictures have been observed in a number of other conditions that lead to increased esophageal acid exposure (eg, systemic sclerosis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, nasogastric tube placement, and after Heller myotomy for achalasia). The management of benign esophageal strictures is discussed separately.

In the acute setting, patients may develop esophagitis resulting in dysphagia and odynophagia. In some patients, chronic ischemia and fibrosis lead to chronic radiation esophagitis, which may present as esophageal ulcerations or strictures in the proximal esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

These include short duration of symptoms (ie, less than six months), presentation after age 60, excessive weight loss in relation to the duration of symptoms, and difficult passage of the endoscope through the gastroesophageal junction. In such cases, endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) should be performed to diagnose an underlying malignancy.

Swallowing may be accompanied by coughing, choking, nasopharyngeal regurgitation, aspiration, and a sensation of residual food remaining in the pharynx. Esophageal dysphagia is characterized by difficulty swallowing several seconds after initiating a swallow and a sensation of food getting stuck in the esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H2648463041\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of nonacute dysphagia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal dysphagia should be characterized according to types of food that produce symptoms (ie, solids, liquids or both), the time course (ie, progressive or intermittent), and associated symptoms (ie, weight loss, heartburn or regurgitation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70866\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70866 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H802823703\" class=\"local\">'Characterizing the symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to diagnostic testing to determine the cause of esophageal dysphagia is based upon the medical history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81108\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81108 \">algorithm 2</a>). We perform a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast esophagram as the initial test (prior to upper endoscopy) in patients with the following.

Although certain motility disorders (eg, achalasia) can be strongly suspected based upon their characteristic radiographic appearance when in advanced stages, confirmation with an esophageal manometry study is required to establish the diagnosis.
