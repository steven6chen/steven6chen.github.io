Children normally have a brief latency to sleep onset and then breathe quietly and comfortably during sleep. Sleep efficiency (time <span class=\"nowrap\">asleep/time</span> in bed) is high (greater than 90 percent). There are few behavioral arousals during the night, and the child awakens in the morning refreshed and ready to learn and play. During the day, children are normally very alert and do not display signs of sleepiness (which can include hyperactivity and poor impulse control). For younger children, a certain frequency of napping is normal and expected. Sleep-related breathing disorders in children occur along a spectrum of severity, ranging from primary snoring on the mild end of the spectrum to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on the serious end of the spectrum.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the normal physiology of sleep in children and the factors that disturb respiration during sleep and contribute to the development of a sleep-related breathing disorder, including OSA. The evaluation of the child with snoring or suspected OSA and the management of the child with OSA are discussed separately.

NREM sleep, REM sleep, and brief periods of wakefulness alternate in a regular and predictable pattern throughout the sleep period, defining the ultradian rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The NREM-REM cycle length increases from 60 minutes at infancy to 90 minutes in adolescents and adults. NREM sleep stage N3 is also labeled as &quot;slow-wave sleep.&quot; Slow-wave sleep predominates in the early part of the sleep period, whereas REM sleep predominates in the latter part of the sleep period. A normal night's sleep for a child is comprised of 5 to 10 NREM-REM sleep cycles woven together seamlessly, so that the transitions from one cycle to the next are behaviorally inapparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGES IN RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY DURING SLEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During sleep in a normal child there is a modest increase in upper airway resistance and a small decrease in nocturnal ventilation. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) studies in normal children have quantified these changes, establishing norms for nocturnal ventilation in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62237\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62237 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. These normative studies have demonstrated that there is a small decrease in oxygen saturation (0 to 7 percent) and a rise in end-tidal PCO2 (0 to 13 mmHg). Brief central apneas (pauses) are common in children, especially in association with movements, but obstructive apneas are never normal in children. </p><p>The decrease in ventilation is caused by both an increase in upper airway resistance and a decrease in central respiratory drive, as detailed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15459797\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased upper airway resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the nose is the site of greatest resistance in the upper airway, the pharynx is the site of the greatest increase in airway resistance during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This increase in resistance is due to the decreased size of the pharynx associated with relaxation of the pharyngeal dilators.</p><p>The pharynx provides a conduit for air, solids, and liquids, and is intimately involved in breathing, digestion, and speaking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78760\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78760 \">image 1</a>). In its role as an organ of respiration, the pharynx must remain patent. In its role as an organ of digestion, the pharynx moves to occlude and protect the nasopharynx and larynx, while directing solids and liquids into the esophagus during swallowing and out of the mouth during vomiting. In its role as an organ of speech, the pharynx provides a steady, highly regulated flow of air that is variably directed into the nose and mouth. </p><p>To fulfill these diverse functions, the pharynx is constructed as a rigid tube with a mobile, collapsible segment in the middle. The collapsible section of the pharynx is controlled by at least 20 sets of paired muscles, which can alter its size, shape, and dynamics, and behaves like a Starling resistor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79617 \">figure 1</a>). The collapsibility of the pharynx is a necessity for it to fulfill its roles in digestion, phonation, and to protect the airway from aspiration, but it is a liability in its role as an organ of respiration and is central to the understanding to the pathophysiology of sleep-related breathing disorders. </p><p>The pharyngeal dilators are a group of muscles that provide the postural tone to the pharynx during wakefulness and maintain pharyngeal patency in the face of the subatmospheric intraluminal pressure generated during inspiration. The pharyngeal dilators that have been studied during sleep in adults are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genioglossus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior cricoarytenoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tensor veli palatini [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal inspiratory muscle (the alae nasi), which affects the airway patency by causing the nasal ala to flare and open during inspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superior constrictor muscle, which also supports the tonsils and prevents them from collapsing when tonically contracted</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levator veli palatine, which gives tone to the soft palate along with the tensor veli palatini</p><p/><p>During wakefulness and sleep, the pharyngeal dilators help to maintain pharyngeal patency by tonic contraction (which is present throughout the respiratory cycle) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phasic contractions (which are synchronized with the contraction of the respiratory pump muscles, thereby helping to stiffen the upper airway prior to and during inspiration). During sleep in individuals without a sleep-related breathing disorder, there is a decrease in activity of the pharyngeal dilators that results in a decrease in pharyngeal size and a concomitant increase in upper airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/8-10,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,15-19</a>].</p><p>As a group, the pharyngeal dilators can be considered accessory muscles of respiration. Their activity during sleep is modulated by the respiratory control center of the medulla, which receives input from the pharyngeal mechanoreceptors. The mechanoreceptors are the afferent limb of a complex pharyngeal reflex that maintains pharyngeal patency during inspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These reflexes have been demonstrated in both children and adults and they augment activation of the pharyngeal dilators in response to negative intraluminal pressure and hypercapnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Topical anesthesia of the pharynx and glottis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] during wakefulness results in a substantial decrease in upper airway size and increase in upper airway resistance, suggesting that the pharyngeal mechanoreceptors play an important role in maintenance of pharyngeal patency during wakefulness. These reflexes likely play an even more important role during sleep in adults and children with sleep-disordered breathing. </p><p>In contrast with adults, normal children snore infrequently and rarely have obstructive apneas during sleep. This is consistent with the better preservation of upper airway patency in response to subatmospheric pressure. Adults with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) tend to have repetitive obstructive apneas, while children with OSAS frequently manifest a pattern of persistent, partial upper airway obstruction, rather than discrete apneas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, the pattern of upper airway muscle recruitment in children with OSAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] may be different from that in adults; children may have greater upper airway muscle activation, thereby preventing total airway occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15459804\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased central respiratory drive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the increased upper airway resistance is reversed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or is minimized by having patients breathe a low density gas, there is still a small decrease in ventilation, suggesting an independent decrease in central respiratory drive during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This decrease has been attributed to the loss of a &quot;wakefulness respiratory drive,&quot; the nature of which is not completely understood.

During sleep, the neuromuscular tone of the pharyngeal dilators, and possibly their coordination with the inspiratory pump muscles, is diminished so that they are less able to compensate. Pharyngeal dilator muscle activity decreases during NREM sleep in children and decreases further during REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These changes in tone of the pharyngeal dilators result in one of three possible outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66838\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66838 \">figure 2</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal sleep</strong> &ndash; During sleep in normal children and adults, there is a small decrease in the size of the pharyngeal airway, resulting in a small but clinically insignificant increase in upper airway resistance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstructive apneas and hypopneas</strong> &ndash; Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in most adults and many children is characterized by repeated transient collapse of the pharyngeal airway.

This finding is common in young children but less common in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) classifies obstructive hypoventilation as a form of pediatric OSA; obstructive hypoventilation is defined as at least 25 percent of total sleep time with hypercapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub>&gt;50 mmHg) associated with either snoring, flattening of the inspiratory nasal pressure waveform, or paradoxical thoracoabdominal motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND OBSTRUCTIVE HYPOVENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep in children with sleep-related breathing disorders is different from sleep in normal children. For children with sleep-related breathing disorders, the increase in upper airway resistance during sleep is exaggerated and can lead to markedly increased work of breathing with snoring, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstructive hypoventilation (OHV), resulting in sleep disruption, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.</p><p>Sleep-related breathing disorders in children ranges on a spectrum from snoring to obstructive hypoventilation to complete obstructive apnea. The precise point along this spectrum that is defined as abnormal is subject to some controversy. There is a growing body of literature describing the physiologic consequences of sleep-related breathing disorders in a child, which include impaired growth, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, and myocardial remodeling. In addition, there appear to be associations between OSA and neurocognitive and behavioral problems, including attention deficit disorder and poor school performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Dynamic MRI studies of the upper airway during tidal breathing under light sedation have demonstrated that the cross-sectional area of the upper airways of children with OSA are significantly smaller at all levels, from the epiglottis inferiorly to the nasopharynx superiorly, compared with normal controls; these differences are also seen dynamically when the inspiration of a normal control is compared with that of a child with OSA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77414\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77414 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The polysomnogram often displays phasic augmentation of chin and intercostal electromyographic (EMG) activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Paradoxical chest and abdominal movements suggest an obstructive breathing pattern in older children. They are seen during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in normal children up until 31 months of age.

At sleep onset, there is decreased tone of the pharyngeal dilators, leading to a decrease in size of the airway. This in turn causes an increase in upper airway resistance, resulting in a decrease in intraluminal pressures in the pharynx. The decreased airflow, increased negative pressure, and increased CO2 stimulate the pharyngeal mechanoreceptors to augment pharyngeal dilator contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a child without sleep-related breathing disorders, this response maintains airway patency.</p><p>In children with sleep-related breathing disorders, this response does not completely relieve the upper airway obstruction. In the mildest form of sleep-disordered breathing, a modest decrease in the size of the pharyngeal airway leads to turbulent airflow causing vibration of the soft palate and snoring. As the upper airway obstruction worsens, hypoventilation ensues, with a rise in PCO<sub>2</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation. This further stimulates the pharyngeal dilators and the respiratory pump muscles. In many children with OSA, this response usually is sufficient to maintain a partially open pharyngeal airway for long periods of sleep without experiencing discrete obstructive apneic events. By contrast, adults with OSA are more likely to have acute obstructive apneic events, leading to arousal, perhaps because the pharyngeal dilators are less effective <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the pharynx is more collapsible as compared with children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18246211\"><span class=\"h2\">Arousal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arousal is the ultimate defense against obstructive apnea since it leads to a change from the sleeping to the waking state, which in turn results in the opening of the pharyngeal airway and relief of the obstruction. Children use this strategy much less often than adults. Several studies have demonstrated that the majority of obstructive apneas in children during both REM and NREM sleep are terminated without a cortical EEG arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. However, many of these events are associated with a subcortical arousal as manifest by a movement and a change in the pulse transit time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The smallest cross-sectional area of the pharyngeal airway in children is the retropalatal area where the tonsils and adenoids overlap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61028 \">figure 3A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,37</a>]. However, adenotonsillar size alone cannot explain the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> since the majority of children with grossly enlarged tonsils and adenoids do not have <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> and the tonsils of children with <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> are not larger than those of children without <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Most studies of children with sleep-disordered breathing have shown only a modest positive correlation between adenotonsillar size and severity of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], and some have shown no correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There is an important interaction between obesity and adenotonsillar hypertrophy, which are the two most common predisposing factors for <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span>. However, in non-obese otherwise healthy children, the success rate of adenotonsillectomy for OSA is about 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These and other factors relevant to decisions about whether to perform adenotonsillectomy are discussed in a separate topic review.

Overall, tonsillectomy is effective for control of <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> in 60 to 70 percent of children with significant tonsillar hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In those children not cured of their <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> by adenotonsillectomy, it is presumed that a substantial part of the <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> was caused by subtle craniofacial or neuromuscular factors or pharyngeal instability, not simply enlarged tonsils and adenoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This is most apparent in children with obesity, in whom a minority have complete resolution of <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> after adenotonsillectomy, although most experience improvement in symptoms. In other children, the <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> initially improves after adenotonsillectomy but later recurs, due to adenoidal tissue regrowth or other factors such as lingual tonsillar hypertrophy, and may resolve after a second surgery.

Although obesity is not as common a cause of <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> in children as it is in adults, the prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">OSA/OHV</span> in obese children is higher than in non-obese children, and this is particularly true for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>]. Because the prevalence and severity of obesity in children is increasing, obesity is likely to become an increasingly important cause of pediatric sleep-related breathing disorders in the future. In a population-based study, the risk of sleep-disordered breathing was increased four- to fivefold in children with obesity, which was defined in this case by a body mass index (BMI) &gt;28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In many cases, obesity and adenotonsillar hypertrophy combine to cause OSA in an individual patient, and children with obesity are more likely than lean patients to have residual OSA after adenotonsillectomy; less than 50 percent of obese patients who undergo adenotonsillectomy for OSA have complete resolution of the OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/44,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,52</a>].

Management of these patients may include diagnostic procedures to determine the anatomic site(s) of obstruction, and adjunctive surgical procedures to relieve the obstruction. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a diagnostic tool to identify the site or sites of upper airway collapse that leads to OSA; the technique utilizes an anesthetic induction to simulate the upper airway relaxation that occurs during natural sleep. The site of obstruction determined on DISE can then be appropriately addressed surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].
