Most head injuries are mild and not associated with brain injury or long-term complications. Very rarely, children with more significant injuries may develop serious complications (eg, brain injury or bleeding around the brain).</p><p>The parent(s) of a <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent</span> with a head injury should work with their child's healthcare provider to determine if the child needs to be evaluated, how to monitor for signs or symptoms of worsening, and develop a plan for minimizing the risk of future injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD INJURY CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls are the most common cause of minor head injury in children and adolescents, followed by motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian and bicycle accidents, sports-related trauma, and child abuse. The risk of brain injury varies with the severity of the trauma.</p><p>Low force injuries (eg, short falls, hit by low speed or soft object such as toy or ball) have a low risk of brain injury.</p><p>In comparison, incidents that have a higher risk of brain injury include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High speed motor vehicle accidents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls from great heights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being hit by a high speed, heavy, or sharp object (eg, baseball bat, golf club, bullet, knife)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflicted injury (abuse), such as vigorous shaking, typically causes severe injury</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD INJURY SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child's behavior and symptoms after a head injury depend upon the type and extent of the injury. The most common signs and symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scalp swelling</strong> &ndash; Scalp swelling is common because there are many blood vessels in the scalp. If the skin is not broken, it is common to develop a large lump from bleeding or swelling under the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss of consciousness</strong> &ndash; Only about 5 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">children/adolescents</span> with a mild head injury pass out (lose consciousness), usually just for a brief period (less than one minute).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Headache</strong> &ndash; Headache occurs in about 45 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">children/adolescents</span> after head injury. In children who are too young to speak, irritability may be an indication of headache or other discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vomiting</strong> &ndash; Approximately 10 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">children/adolescents</span> have at least one episode of vomiting after a head injury. Children who vomit after a head injury do not necessarily have a serious brain injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Seizures </strong>&ndash; Less than one percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">children/adolescents</span> have a seizure immediately after a head injury. A few of these children have a serious head injury. A CT scan of the head is usually recommended in this situation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Imaging tests'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concussion</strong> &ndash; The term concussion is used to describe a mild form of traumatic brain injury. Common symptoms of a concussion include confusion, amnesia (not being able to remember events around the time of the injury), headache, vomiting, and dizziness. Loss of consciousness may occur but is uncommon, occurring in about 10 percent of young athletes with concussions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD INJURY TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many parents wonder if their <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent</span> needs medical attention after a head injury. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents contact their child's healthcare provider for advice for anything more than a light bump on the head.</p><p>Children with any of the following symptoms need to be evaluated by a healthcare provider since these symptoms may indicate a higher risk of complications. Depending upon the particular circumstances, this may be done at the pediatrician's office or in an emergency department:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has recurrent vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has a seizure (convulsion)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child loses consciousness after the injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child develops a headache that is severe or worsens with time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are changes in the child's behavior (eg, lethargic, difficult to wake, extremely irritable, or exhibiting other abnormal behavior)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child stumbles, or difficulty walking, clumsiness, or lack of coordination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child is confused or has slurred speech</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child has dizziness that does not resolve or recurs repeatedly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If blood or watery fluid oozes from the nose or ears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child is younger than six months of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cut will not stop bleeding after applying pressure for 10 minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child fell from a height greater than three to five feet, was hit with a high speed object, or was hit with great force</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/caregiver</span> is concerned about how the child is acting</p><p/><p>The goal of the evaluation is to determine if there is serious brain injury. The evaluation can also determine if the child needs immediate treatment, close follow up, or further testing (eg, computed tomography of the head or a &ldquo;CAT scan&rdquo;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents should try to describe how the injury occurred, if possible, including what the child was doing before the injury and how <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> responded after the injury. If there is any reason to suspect that another adult or child intentionally injured the child, this should be discussed with the healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many parents assume that their child will undergo imaging tests after a head injury. The purpose of imaging tests, such as a head CT (computed tomography), is to determine if there is bleeding inside or around the brain, if there is a skull fracture, or if there are other serious brain injuries. Most children with a minor head injury do <strong>not</strong> require an imaging test because the risk of a serious brain injury is small.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">When is a head CT needed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A head CT should be performed when there is concern about a serious brain injury. However, unnecessary use of CT exposes children to radiation and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A head CT may be recommended if there are concerning signs or symptoms of brain injury during the examination. These include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged loss of consciousness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or severe memory loss, confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe, persistent, or worsening headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspicion of intentional injury (abuse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral changes (eg, lethargy, decreased alertness, extreme irritability)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of a skull fracture or bulging fontanel (soft spot on an infant's head)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal neurologic examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant scalp bruise or swelling in a very young infant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody or clear fluid oozing from the ears or nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incident with a higher risk of brain injury (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Head injury causes'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Why is CT best?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head CT is recommended to evaluate head injuries because it is fast, available in most hospitals, and is good at identifying recent, severe injuries. Young children may need to be sedated briefly (less than 15 minutes in most cases) to obtain the best results.</p><p>MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain is <strong>not</strong> the test of choice for recent brain injury. In addition, in most hospitals, it is not usually available quickly. MRI requires the child to remain completely still for at least 30 minutes, which often requires prolonged sedation or general anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, it is not clear initially if a head CT is needed. In studies, some children with vomiting, headache, or a brief loss of consciousness (without other symptoms) have a traumatic brain injury while others do not.</p><p>In these cases, one reasonable strategy is to observe the child closely for four to six hours after the injury, usually in the emergency department. If the child develops any other symptoms, a CT scan could be done at that time. If no further symptoms occur, the child does not usually need a CT scan. Children who are well more than 12 hours after a head injury have a very low risk of brain injury that requires surgical intervention, although there is always a very small chance. Observation has been shown to decrease the number of children undergoing CT scans without missing important injuries. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD INJURY TREATMENT AT HOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent's</span> injury is mild and there are no worrisome signs or symptoms, he or she can be treated and monitored at home. However, if there is any evidence that the injury is more serious, the child should be evaluated in their doctor's office or an emergency department. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Head injury tests'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Rest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Encourage the child to lie down or choose a quiet activity. Allow the child to sleep if desired. It is not dangerous to sleep after a minor head injury (especially if it is nap time), although the parent should monitor the child. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring after a head injury'</a> below.)</p><p>A mild headache, nausea, and dizziness are common, especially during the first few hours after the injury. If the child is nauseous or has vomited, try offering clear liquids (eg, soda, clear juice, gelatin).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the head is bleeding, clean the area with soap and water and apply pressure to the area with a clean cloth (sterile gauze, if available). Bleeding should stop within 10 minutes. If bleeding does not stop or the cut is large, the child should be evaluated to determine if stitches are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Swelling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Swelling (a large lump or &quot;goose egg&quot;) is also common after a head injury. To reduce swelling, an ice or a cold pack can be applied to the area for 20 minutes. Swelling usually begins to improve within a few hours, but may take one week to completely resolve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol&reg;) may be given for a headache. If the child's headache is severe or worsens, the child should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AFTER A HEAD INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents of a child with a head injury are usually instructed to observe their child at home for signs of worsening injury. The parent(s) should call the pediatrician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> take the child to the emergency department immediately if the child does any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits twice or continues to vomit four to six hours after the injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develops a severe or worsening headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becomes more and more drowsy or is hard to awaken</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is confused or not acting normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a hard time walking, talking, or seeing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develops a stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a seizure (convulsion) or any abnormal movements or behaviors that worry you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot stop crying or looks sicker</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has weakness or numbness involving any part of the body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Waking from sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not usually necessary to wake the <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent</span> from sleep after a minor head injury. If the healthcare provider recommends waking the child, he or she should be able to wake up and recognize his or her surroundings and <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/caretaker</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up visit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most healthcare providers recommend a follow up visit or phone call within 24 hours after the injury. This is to ensure that the child is behaving normally, feeling well, and that there are no signs of brain injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to play</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents who have sustained a concussion are at risk for a serious or even fatal complication if they have a second head injury within a short time after the first injury. This is called second impact syndrome.</p><p>Any <span class=\"nowrap\">child/adolescent</span> who is suspected of having a concussion should be removed from play (eg, if playing a team sport) and monitored for signs of brain injury (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Head injury symptoms'</a> above). The child should follow up with a physician before returning to play.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD INJURY OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with a minor head trauma who do not have brain injury usually recover completely without any long term complications. Children with mild traumatic brain injury usually recover completely as well, but must be monitored closely and allowed to fully recover before returning to sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD INJURY PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head injuries can often be prevented. The following tips can help to prevent head injuries, as well as other types of injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Bicycle safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of bicycle-related deaths and hospital admissions are caused by head injuries. Bicycle helmets reduce the risk of head, and brain injuries for bicyclists of all ages. Thus, all bicycle riders and passengers of all ages should wear a helmet <strong>every</strong> time they ride a bicycle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only bicycle helmets that meet US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards should be used; helmets that have been involved in a crash should be thrown away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bicycle helmets should fit properly and be worn in the proper position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59465 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children younger than one year should not ride in bicycle-mounted carriers or trailers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When used, mounted carriers should be securely mounted, should have a spoke guard and seat with a high back, shoulder harness, and lap belt. Mounted carriers are not recommended once the child approaches four years of age since the weight of the child makes the bicycle unstable and difficult to handle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For child passengers, bicycle trailers are a safer alternative to bicycle mounted carriers. Children who ride in bicycle trailers should wear a helmet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Bicycle skills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for children to have the developmental skills needed to ride a bike.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children younger than three years often do not have the developmental skills necessary to ride a tricycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children aged four to five can typically ride a bicycle with training wheels and foot-operated brakes; they should not ride in traffic and must be supervised at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children aged six and older can usually operate hand brakes and ride a bicycle without training wheels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children should not be permitted to ride in traffic until they have demonstrated that they can control the bicycle, understand and follow the rules of the road, and exercise good judgment. The age at which a child has these skills is variable. Until this point, the child should be closely supervised by an adult and should not ride in the street.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">General safety tips</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Install car seats and booster seats correctly, and use the seat <strong>every</strong> time the child rides in a car. A booster seat is needed until the shoulder belt can be worn across the shoulder (rather than the face or neck), when the child is at least 4 feet 9 inches (142.5 cm) tall. Individual states may have additional regulations regarding the need for booster seats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many fire and police departments in the United States can determine if the seat is installed correctly. More information is available <a href=\"https://www.safercar.gov/parents/carseats/How-To-Install-Car-Seats.htm?view=full&amp;token=vdCs7dqmABYrTYLl86e3UGqOtfStcNtQcW7LlLhWKb3iU/r3ZX4BIN0+NiewDlOgNf7S7JDDIx3Eqfl36HysNA8MMuarFNVGnSOFbRMA+pVtwjLCg37IoHv+6xqMFgZY&amp;TOPIC_ID=1180\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use gates on stairways and doors to prevent injuries in infants and young children. Install window guards on all windows above the first floor. Do not use wheeled baby walkers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach children to safely cross the street by stopping at the curb and looking both ways (left, right, left). Young children should never cross the street alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss sports safety with your child's healthcare provider. Be sure that the child or adolescent has the appropriate protective equipment for biking, skating, skateboarding, skiing, snowboarding, or contact sports. Protective equipment often includes a helmet, mouthguard, wrist guards, eye protection, and knee and shin pads.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=1180\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
