The evaluation of weight loss in older infants, children, adolescents, and adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-over-six-months-of-age-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of weight loss in infants over six months of age, children, and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-unintentional-weight-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with unintentional weight loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2397319068\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss in young infants is commonly caused by acute infection, problems with feeding, milk protein allergy, malnutrition, or failure to thrive. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, pyloric stenosis, and child neglect are other frequent etiologies. Dehydration associated with any etiology can be severe. Although less common, other life-threatening conditions include intestinal malrotation with volvulus, congenital heart disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and inborn errors of metabolism. A careful, thorough history and physical examination, in conjunction with the judicious use of laboratory tests, will often reveal the cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5455998\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major components of weight include water, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Weight loss occurs when the daily balance of one or several of these components becomes negative. During infancy and early childhood, major causes of weight loss include inadequate calorie intake to meets the energy demands of the child's metabolism for daily activity and growth, or negative fluid balance. Specific etiologies include decreased calorie intake, normal calorie intake with an increased metabolic need, or normal calorie intake in the setting of malabsorption or excessive loss. During acute illnesses, such as gastroenteritis, fluid losses that exceed intake can lead to significant weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5456005\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for weight loss in the young infant is wide and may require an extensive work-up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88699 \">table 1</a>). In many patients, a diagnosis is not established during an initial visit, but the evaluation may begin and specialist referrals made as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5456013\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5456021\"><span class=\"h3\">Dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe dehydration from acute gastroenteritis can lead to significant weight loss from fluid losses. Dehydration from gastroenteritis is one of the leading causes of death among infants in developing nations. Infants with acute gastroenteritis typically present with acute onset of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and decreased feeding. Blood or mucous in the stool or rice water stool suggest bacterial enteritis or cholera, respectively. Dehydration may also occur due to other acute infections (eg, pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infection), conditions causing decreased intake (eg, feeding disorders, congenital heart disease, child neglect, malnutrition) or conditions associated with increased loses (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pyloric stenosis, milk protein allergy with diarrhea, or intestinal malabsorption). Findings of significant dehydration (eg, prolonged capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes or fontanelle, or lethargy) are commonly found on physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Repletion of fluid losses and management of gastroenteritis are discussed in more detail separately.

Volvulus occurs when small bowel twists around the superior mesenteric artery resulting in vascular compromise to large portions of the midgut (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78111 \">figure 1</a>). Most children with intestinal malrotation develop signs of acute small bowel obstruction in early infancy. Intestinal malrotation should be suspected in any infant with bilious vomiting. Physical examination may reveal mild distension of the abdomen, diffuse tenderness with or without signs of peritonitis, and bloody stool on rectal examination. Blood in the stool is a worrisome sign, since it suggests bowel ischemia and possible necrosis from volvulus. Third space fluid losses and sepsis, caused by necrotic bowel, can cause rapidly progressive cardiovascular compromise. Prompt fluid resuscitation and surgical intervention are essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>If the child is hemodynamically stable, the diagnosis should be confirmed by radiologic evaluation. This evaluation typically begins with plain radiographs, which are rarely diagnostic, but are important to exclude obvious perforation indicated by pneumoperitoneum. Plain radiographs are followed by an upper gastrointestinal contrast series, which is the best examination to visualize the duodenum in infants and children. It should be performed, whenever possible, under fluoroscopy by an experienced pediatric radiologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9144213\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder in newborns; ventricular septal defects account for approximately half of malformations. Infants with congenital heart disease frequently have difficulty feeding with resulting weight loss from dehydration or protein-calorie malnutrition. Though cyanotic and ductal dependent heart lesions are typically diagnosed perinatally and up to two weeks of age, many cardiac lesions (eg, structural lesions, cardiomyopathies, and cardiac tumors) may present later in infancy with weight loss or poor weight gain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease#H608469901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease&quot;, section on 'Postnatal diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In affected infants, parents most commonly notice difficulty with feeding. This may be manifested by intake of a limited volume of milk. Feedings may also take too long due to frequent interruption by sleeping or resting, choking, gagging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting. Infants may have respiratory distress that is reported by parents as fast or hard breathing, worse with feedings, or a persistent cough or wheeze. Other manifestations include color changes, such as central cyanosis or persistent pallor; excessive sweating that is increased with feeding and occurs during sleep, decreased activity, or excessive sleeping. Physical examination may demonstrate a cardiac murmur, gallop, or decreased pulses in the lower extremities. Electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, echocardiogram and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should be performed for any infant in whom congenital heart disease is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease#H2707798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5456028\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited defects in the enzymatic steps of cortisol biosynthesis (steroidogenesis) result in disease states termed congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 2</a>). These disorders cause primary adrenal insufficiency because they impair cortisol synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76865 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>CYP21A2 (21-hydroxylase) deficiency is the most common form of CAH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 2</a>). It accounts for more than 95 percent of cases of adrenal steroidogenic defects, and is estimated to occur in one in 14,200 live births. CYP21A2 deficiency usually presents as one of two clinical syndromes in neonates or very young infants, both of which are associated with glucocorticoid deficiency: a salt-wasting form (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension on account of mineralocorticoid deficiency) with ambiguous genitalia in affected females (because of adrenal androgen excess), and a simple virilizing form in affected males and females without salt wasting. In some infants, the distinction between the two forms is not clear. Adrenal crisis with circulatory collapse may occur within the first few days to weeks of life. In the United States, 21-hydroxylase deficiency is part of the newborn screen in all states, so most affected infants are diagnosed prior to developing adrenal crisis.

These problems often interfere with the coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing and may lead to weight loss or poor weight gain in the young infant. Premature infants, children with anatomic malformations of the oropharynx or esophagus (eg, cleft lip and palate or tracheo-esophageal fistula), neuromuscular weakness including infant botulism, or chronic neurologic disorders (eg, cerebral palsy or neuromuscular weakness) are at highest risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders#H18740620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Prematurely born infants and those requiring prolonged endotracheal intubation early in life may be at increased risk of having oral aversion.&nbsp;Some infants become extremely sensitive to certain textures and may refuse food intake. This aversion can range from a mild intolerance to textured foods to a complete refusal to take anything by mouth. A psychologist, speech therapist, or occupational therapist experienced in working with feeding disorders should be consulted as soon as a problem when oral aversion is suspected. A thorough evaluation will be needed to establish the range of factors involved and to rule out unidentified physiological problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders#H233306180\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;, section on 'Management approach'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with neuromuscular disease may present with poor weight gain or weight loss in association with generalized weakness, hypotonia, and feeding difficulty. Problems with sucking and swallowing are common in infants with central nervous system or neuromuscular disorders. In addition, difficulty maintaining airway patency and clearing secretions can predispose these patients to recurrent respiratory infections, which increases metabolic demand. Patients with significant disease must often maintain long term daily nutritional requirements through feeding tubes or parenteral supplementation.

Regurgitation is present in 50 to 70 percent of all infants, peaks at age four months, and typically resolves by one year. In contrast, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the reflux episodes are associated with symptoms or complications. A small minority of infants with GERD develop other symptoms, including feeding refusal, irritability possibly secondary to pain during eating, hematemesis, anemia, respiratory symptoms, and failure to thrive. Decreased food intake without any other complaints may be a symptom of esophagitis in infants, which can cause weight loss. In some infants, the pain of esophagitis causes arching of the back, extension of the neck, and turning of the head to the side in associated with regurgitation or choking (Sandifer syndrome). Color change (pallor or cyanosis) may also occur. These episodes may be mistaken for seizures, apnea, or dystonia. GERD is a clinical diagnosis. In patients who do not respond to treatment, upper endoscopy with biopsy of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum may be indicated.

The classic presentation is a three to six-week-old first-born male infant who develops immediate postprandial, non-bilious, often projectile vomiting and demands to be re-fed soon afterwards (a &quot;hungry vomiter&quot;). Vomiting may be less forceful in premature infants and those with central nervous system anomalies or cleft lip and palate. Significant dehydration with hemodynamic instability can occur. Laboratory evaluation classically shows a hypochloremic, metabolic alkalosis resulting from the loss of large amounts of gastric hydrochloric acid. The severity of these laboratory abnormalities depends upon the duration of symptoms prior to initial evaluation. Diagnosis is made by palpation of the hypertrophic pylorus or by demonstration of characteristic findings on ultrasound or an upper gastrointestinal study with contrast swallow.

It is defined by the National Center of Child Abuse and Neglect as failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs. The manifestations of infant neglect leading to weight loss may include starvation or dehydration due to inadequate provision of food and water, poor hygiene of an infant's body, failure to provide for the infant's medical needs, and physical abuse. Many, but not all neglected infants will also have physical signs of abuse including fractures and bruises.

Clinical symptoms of cow's milk protein allergy frequently appear during the first few months of life, often within days or weeks after the introduction of a cow's milk-based formula into the diet, although symptoms may also occur with exclusive breastfeeding if the mother ingests cow's milk. Patients typically present with weight loss in association with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody stools though patients can also present with atopy, anaphylaxis, or more severe gastrointestinal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50085\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50085 \">table 6</a>).

The gold-standard for diagnosis is a clinician-supervised double-blind, placebo controlled oral food challenge, although an open challenge will often suffice. Measurement of cow's milk-specific IgE can aid in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated CMA and may eliminate the need for oral food challenges.

FTT is used to describe instances of growth failure or, more specifically, failure to gain weight appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-weight-loss-in-infants-six-months-of-age-and-younger/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In more severe cases, linear growth and head circumference also may be affected. A wide variety of medical problems and psychosocial stressors can contribute to FTT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69846\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69846 \">table 7</a>); however, the underlying cause is always &quot;insufficient usable nutrition&quot;.

This is particularly true in the presence of oral ulcers, candidiasis, or chronic diarrhea. Almost three-fourths of the primary immunodeficiencies are caused by an antibody (B cell) deficiency or a combined antibody plus cellular (T cell) abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80845 \">figure 3</a>). Isolated T cell defects, as well as phagocytic cell, complement, and other innate immune defects, are much less common. Thus, B cell (antibody) or combined B and T cell diseases should be considered initially, unless clinical features suggest otherwise. Recurrent infections comprise the most common clinical findings. The type and pattern of recurring infections depend upon which components of the immune system are affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74045 \">table 8</a>). Infection severity also varies, ranging from mild respiratory infections to overwhelming systemic infections.

Specific genes have been identified for some of these disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73777\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73777 \">table 9</a>). If a congenital diarrhea is suspected, stool electrolytes, pH, fat, and reducing substances should be measured. A trial of fasting should be performed to determine if the diarrhea is secretory or osmotic. Further evaluation of congenital secretory and osmotic diarrhea is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Congenital diarrheas'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kidney disease </strong>&ndash; Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rare cause of weight loss in newborns and young infants. It should be suspected in patients who have an elevated or rising serum creatinine, anuria, or oliguria. Oligoanuria is defined as no urine output noted by 48 hours of age or a diminished urine output (urine volume less than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour). Although the time of the first void is variable, at least 50 percent of newborns void by eight hours of age and nearly all before 24 hours. However, the presence of urine does <strong>not</strong> rule out AKI since some infants are nonoliguric. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of neonatal AKI is confirmed by either a serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or increases by at least 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (17 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> per day. Causes of neonatal AKI are categorized as prerenal failure due to decreased renal perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oxygenation, intrinsic renal failure due to renal vascular thrombosis, or <span class=\"nowrap\">congenital/genetic</span> renal disorders (eg, renal dysplasia or renal tubular acidosis), and postrenal failure due to obstructive uropathy. Laboratory evaluation includes urinalysis, complete blood count, measurement of urine sodium excretion in oliguric patients, urinary osmolality, and renal ultrasound.

Many patients will have recurrent or persistent wheezing, increased respiratory rate and effort, feeding difficulties, and weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasian populations, with a frequency of 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births. Presentations in young infants include meconium ileus at birth, wheezing, coughing, recurring respiratory infections and pneumonia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal malabsorption with steatorrhea and failure to thrive. Screening for CF is performed at birth in most resource-rich countries. Diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of an elevated sweat chloride test. For optimal accuracy, sweat testing should be performed when the infant is at least two weeks of age and weighs &gt;2 kg.
