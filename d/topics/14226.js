The prevention of AKI in patients who have suffered trauma and are entrapped at the site of trauma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crush-related acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The general approaches to the treatment of the factor(s) causing rhabdomyolysis (including an acute compartment syndrome) or hemolysis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic anemia due to drugs and toxins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25398985\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevention of AKI requires early and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The goals of volume repletion are to maintain or enhance renal perfusion, thereby minimizing ischemic injury, and to increase the urine flow rate, which will limit intratubular cast formation by diluting the concentration of heme pigment within the tubular fluid, wash out partially obstructing intratubular casts, and increase urinary potassium excretion.</p><p>Intravenous isotonic saline should be administered as soon as possible after the onset of injury (even while the patient is being rescued) or detection of hemolysis and continued until the muscle injury or hemolysis has resolved. The evidence to support this strategy is largely based upon studies of traumatic crush injuries that have resulted from large-scale natural or manmade disasters. Although these studies are predominantly retrospective and underpowered, they are believed to be broadly applicable to AKI that is due to nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis and to hemolysis as well, given their common underlying pathogeneses. These studies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crush-related acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal fluid and rate of repletion are unclear. No studies have directly compared the efficacy and safety of different types and rates of fluid administration in this setting. In particular, no studies have directly compared the use of chloride-restricted (bicarbonate, lactate, or acetate as the accompanying anion) versus chloride-liberal fluid resuscitation strategies in the prevention of heme pigment-induced AKI due either to rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Buffered crystalloid versus isotonic saline'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the total amount and rate of volume repletion will vary depending on the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis.</p><p>As an example, attempted aggressive volume resuscitation in the setting of massive hemolysis may result in volume overload and pulmonary edema, especially in patients with compromised cardiac function. In contrast, volume overload is less likely to occur in patients with rhabdomyolysis, at least during its initial stages, due to the sequestration of significant amounts of fluid within damaged muscle.</p><p>For patients who are at risk for heme-associated AKI due to rhabdomyolysis from any cause, we suggest initial fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline at a rate of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour</span>. The plasma creatine kinase (CK) concentration correlates with the severity of muscle injury, and concentrations &gt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> identify patients who are at risk for the development of AKI. However, it may be difficult to identify patients who are at high risk for AKI based upon the initial plasma CK value since the CK level may still be rising from ongoing muscle injury. Thus, sequential CK measurements are critical in tailoring therapeutic interventions.</p><p>All patients should be initially treated with vigorous fluid repletion until it is clear from sequential laboratory values that the plasma CK level is stable and not increasing. Patients who have a stable plasma CK level &lt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> do not require intravenous fluid, since studies have shown that the risk of AKI is low among such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. A risk prediction score has been published that incorporates other risk factors for heme-induced AKI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H185775628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Risk prediction score for severe acute kidney injury or death'</a>.)</p><p>Fluid requirements may be less among patients with hemolysis, who are generally less volume depleted than patients who have rhabdomyolysis. In patients who are at risk for heme-associated AKI due to hemolysis, we suggest isotonic saline at an initial rate of 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. The degree of hemolysis that is associated with the risk of AKI is not known. All patients should be initially treated with intravenous saline, providing volume overload is not present. Fluid administration should continue until hemolysis is controlled unless the patient develops signs of volume overload.</p><p>The volume status of the patient should be carefully assessed and urine output monitored. The initial rate is continued until the systemic blood pressure normalizes and the patient starts to produce urine or there is evidence of volume overload. Volume overload is defined by signs of pulmonary congestion or via central hemodynamic monitoring since peripheral edema may be present, even in the absence of volume overload, due to third space sequestration. If an adequate diuresis is established, fluids are titrated to maintain a urine output of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.</p><p>Among patients with rhabdomyolysis, fluid repletion should be continued until plasma CK levels decrease to &lt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> and continue to fall. Studies have shown that there is a low likelihood of AKI when peak CK levels are under 5000 to 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Among patients with hemolysis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin levels should be monitored to guide intravenous fluid therapy and indicate when to stop fluid administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H11512190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Other laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25398992\"><span class=\"h2\">Bicarbonate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with rhabdomyolysis who are appropriately monitored may benefit from bicarbonate therapy. We generally administer a bicarbonate infusion to patients who have severe rhabdomyolysis, such as those with a serum CK above 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> or clinical evidence of severe muscle injury (eg, crush injury) and a rising serum CK, regardless of the initial value. In such patients, bicarbonate may be given, providing the following conditions are met:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypocalcemia is not present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial pH is less than 7.5</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum bicarbonate is less 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p/><p>We generally do <strong>not</strong> administer bicarbonate to patients with hemolysis, unless another indication is present (such as concurrent rhabdomyolysis, which may occur in the settings of envenomation and poisonings). The use of bicarbonate has not been evaluated in patients with hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury#H11512162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Causes of hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with rhabdomyolysis, we infuse approximately 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> (150 mL [3 amps] of 8.4 percent sodium bicarbonate mixed with 1 L of 5 percent dextrose or water)<strong> </strong>via an intravenous line separate from that used for the isotonic saline infusion. The initial rate of infusion is 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour;</span> the rate is adjusted to achieve a urine pH of &gt;6.5.</p><p>If bicarbonate is given, the arterial pH and serum calcium should be monitored every two hours during the infusion. The bicarbonate infusion should be discontinued if the urine pH does not rise above 6.5 after three to four hours, if the patient develops symptomatic hypocalcemia, if the arterial pH exceeds 7.5, or if the serum bicarbonate exceeds 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. If the bicarbonate solution is discontinued, volume repletion should be continued with isotonic saline.</p><p>If a diuresis is established, we suggest continuing bicarbonate therapy until plasma CK decreases to less than 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> or symptomatic fluid overload develops.</p><p>A forced alkaline diuresis, in which the urine pH is raised to above 6.5, may diminish the renal toxicity of heme pigments. In theory, urine alkalinization prevents heme-protein precipitation with Tamm-Horsfall protein and therefore intratubular pigment cast formation. Alkalinization may also decrease the release of free iron from myoglobin, the formation of vasoconstricting F2-isoprostanes, and the risk for tubular precipitation of uric acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1,2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7</a>].</p><p>Despite these potential benefits, there is no clear clinical evidence that an alkaline diuresis is more effective than a saline diuresis in preventing AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The only data in support of an alkaline diuresis are derived from uncontrolled case series in which a benefit was demonstrated among patients with severe rhabdomyolysis. These data are discussed elsewhere. Data on the combination of bicarbonate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> are presented below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crush-related acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Use of bicarbonate'</a> and <a href=\"#H25398999\" class=\"local\">'Mannitol'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to a lack of clear evidence of benefit, maintaining the urine pH above 6.5 is difficult in patients with AKI. There are also potential risks to alkalinization of the plasma, such as promoting calcium phosphate deposition (which is more likely if hyperphosphatemia is present) and inducing or worsening the manifestations of hypocalcemia by both a direct membrane effect and a reduction in ionized calcium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Manifestations of severe hypocalcemia include tetany, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The alkalinization of urine could increase the risk of from intratubular deposition of calcium-phosphate in the setting of rhabdomyolysis-induced hyperphosphatemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25398999\"><span class=\"h2\">Mannitol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>. The benefit of mannitol in rhabdomyolysis is not established. Experimental studies suggested that mannitol might be protective by causing a diuresis, which minimizes intratubular heme pigment deposition and cast formation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by acting as a free radical scavenger, thereby minimizing cell injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, mannitol did not ameliorate proximal tubular necrosis, suggesting that the induced diuresis was of primary importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The available retrospective series in humans reported conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of combined administration of bicarbonate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> in preventing heme pigment-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In a series of 382 patients with serum CK concentration &gt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L,</span> 154 (40 percent) were treated with bicarbonate and mannitol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of renal failure (defined as serum creatinine &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L];</span> 22 versus 18 percent), dialysis (7 versus 6 percent), or death (15 versus 18 percent) in patients who were or were not treated with bicarbonate and mannitol, respectively. However, there was a trend toward improved outcomes in patients with extremely high serum CK levels (greater than 30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L)</span> treated with bicarbonate and mannitol.</p><p>Unless the patient is carefully monitored and losses replaced when appropriate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> can lead to both volume depletion and, since free water is lost with mannitol, hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mannitol administered in very high doses, or to patients with reduced renal excretion due to renal insufficiency, can cause hyperosmolality, volume expansion, and hyperosmolar hyponatremia. The increase in plasma osmolality can also cause passive movement of potassium out of cells and raise the plasma potassium concentration. AKI may occur if patients are treated with more than 200 g of mannitol per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-mannitol-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of mannitol therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> administration may be of benefit in patients with marked elevations in CK (&gt;30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L);</span> however, even in these patients with severe rhabdomyolysis, the true benefit associated with mannitol administration remains undefined.

Mannitol is contraindicated in patients with oligoanuria, and patients should have adequate urine outputs (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span>.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> is given, the plasma osmolal gap should be measured and mannitol discontinued if the osmolal gap rises above 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). Mannitol should be discontinued if the desired diuresis of approximately 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> cannot be achieved since there is a risk of hyperosmolality, volume overload, and hyperkalemia with continued mannitol administration under these conditions.

Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation is the major preventive therapy. We recommend that all patients with rhabdomyolysis who have plasma creatine kinase (CK) values &gt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> and those who have CK values that are increasing regardless of baseline value be administered intravenous fluid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25398985\" class=\"local\">'Volume administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal fluid for the prevention of heme-induced AKI is not known. For patients with rhabdomyolysis who are to receive intravenous fluid, we suggest initial volume repletion with isotonic saline rather than other fluids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25398985\" class=\"local\">'Volume administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal rate of repletion for the prevention of heme-induced AKI is not known. For patients with rhabdomyolysis who are to receive intravenous fluid, we suggest initial volume repletion at a rate of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour</span> rather than lower or higher rates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The rate is adjusted to maintain the desired diuresis of approximately 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. (See <a href=\"#H25398985\" class=\"local\">'Volume administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heme-induced AKI from hemolysis may also be prevented by volume repletion. The volume requirements for patients with hemolysis are generally less than the volume requirements of patients with rhabdomyolysis. For patients at risk for heme-induced AKI from hemolysis, we suggest initial volume repletion with isotonic saline at a rate of 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> rather than lower or higher rates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25398985\" class=\"local\">'Volume administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited data suggest that alkalinization of urine may benefit patients with severe rhabdomyolysis. The administration of bicarbonate may cause severe alkalosis among anuric patients. For patients with rhabdomyolysis in whom a diuresis is established with volume repletion, we suggest the administration of an alkaline solution rather than isotonic saline, providing the patient is not hypocalcemic and has an arterial pH less than 7.5 and a serum bicarbonate less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25398992\" class=\"local\">'Bicarbonate'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crush-related acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Use of bicarbonate'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The alkaline solution should be discontinued if the urine pH does not rise above 6.5 after three to four hours of the alkaline solution, if the arterial pH increases to 7.5, if the serum bicarbonate exceeds 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> or if symptomatic hypocalcemia develops. If the bicarbonate solution is discontinued, volume repletion should be continued with isotonic saline. (See <a href=\"#H25398992\" class=\"local\">'Bicarbonate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics have not been shown to be effective in preventing heme pigment-induced AKI but may be given to patients who develop volume overload as a result of aggressive volume administration. (See <a href=\"#H25398999\" class=\"local\">'Mannitol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma potassium and calcium should be monitored several times daily until stable. Hyperkalemia should be treated as discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium supplementation should be given only for symptomatic hypocalcemia or severe hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypocalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis may be necessary for control of hyperkalemia and correction of acidosis or for the treatment of volume overload. (See <a href=\"#H25399021\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of established AKI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2404634137\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Joseph A Eustace, MB, MHS, MRCPI, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p><p>We are saddened by the death of Sinead Kinsella, MD, MBS, MRCPI, who passed away in July 2016.
