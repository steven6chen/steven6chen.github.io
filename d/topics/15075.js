Next to cortical blindness, ROP is the most common cause of childhood blindness in the United States. Other ophthalmologic disorders that occur frequently in preterm infants include amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening for ROP. The management and prognosis of ROP are discussed separately.

No blood vessels are present in the retina before approximately 16 weeks gestation. From approximately the sixth week, the anterior segment of the eye receives its vascular supply from the hyaloid artery. This artery originates from the optic nerve, passes through the vitreous, and supplies vessels to both surfaces of the lens and iris. These vessels usually are resorbed by 34 weeks of gestation.</p><p>Retinal vascularization normally begins at 15 to 18 weeks gestation. Retinal blood vessels extend out from the optic disc (where the optic nerve enters the eye) and grow peripherally. Vascularization in the nasal retina is complete at approximately 36 weeks. Vascular development usually is complete in the temporal retina by 40 weeks, although maturation may be delayed until 48 to 52 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) in preterm infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81538 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascularization in ROP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of ROP is thought to involve two stages. An initial injury caused by factors such as hypotension, hypoxia, or hyperoxia, with free radical formation, injures newly developing blood vessels and disrupts normal angiogenesis. Following this disruption, vessels either resume normal growth or new vessels grow abnormally out from the retina into the vitreous. Increased permeability of these abnormal new vessels (neovascularization) can result in retinal edema and hemorrhage. Abnormal fibrovascular tissue may develop along with the neovascularization and later contract, producing traction on the retina. In some severe cases, this results in retinal distortion or retinal detachment. However, in most instances, the abnormal vascular tissue regresses with little residual effect.</p><p>Regulation of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other cytokines appear to contribute to both normal retinal vessel growth and abnormal vascular disruption and subsequent neovascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. The mechanisms that determine whether initial disruption of normal angiogenesis in ROP will be followed by resumption of normal vascular development or progression of pathologic neovascularization are unknown.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) supports normal retinal vascular growth and interacts with VEGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The possible role of IGF-1 in ROP has been evaluated in several series of preterm infants who had serial blood samples and retinal examinations. In each of these series, decreased serum concentrations of IGF-1 were associated with the development of ROP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. With low IGF-1, vessels cease to grow, the maturing avascular retina becomes hypoxic, and VEGF accumulates. Later, as IGF-1 levels rise during maturation and reach a critical level, neovascularization ensues. Activation of a specific VEGF receptor may protect developing retinal vessels and prevent retinal ischemia induced by oxygen. This was investigated in a study in newborn mice, in which activation of the VEGF receptor VEGFR-1 by placental growth factor-1 (PGF-1) decreased the obliteration of retinal vessels by hyperoxia (22 versus 5 percent) and did not induce neovascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Stimulation of another VEGF receptor, VGEFR-2, had no effect on blood vessel survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Photoreceptor development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ROP appears to affect photoreceptor development. An observational study in which retinal sensitivity and retinal responsivity were assessed by electroretinography between 30 and 72 weeks PMA suggests that photoreceptor development is altered in prematurity (with or without ROP), that conditions that affect the photoreceptor cells (eg, ROP, ROP treatment) appear to reduce sensitivity, and that retinal neuronal behavior may be influenced by extrauterine experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ROP affects a substantial number of preterm infants worldwide. Both the incidence and severity increase with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p>In a study of 951 preterm infants born (&lt;37 weeks GA) at a single center between 1989 and 1997, ROP developed in 21 percent of patients and severe ROP in 5 percent (stage &ge;3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. No infant born at &gt;32 weeks GA developed the disorder, and no infant born at &gt;28 weeks GA required surgical intervention.</p><p>In a multicenter study conducted in the United States between October 2000 and October 2002, the incidence of ROP in preterm infants (BW &lt;1251 g) was 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The overall incidence of severe ROP was 36 percent. The incidence of ROP was 8 percent, 19 percent, and 43 percent among infants born at &ge;32 weeks, &gt;27 to 31 weeks, and &le;27 weeks gestation, respectively.</p><p>The increased incidence of severe ROP with decreasing GA also was demonstrated in a population-based cohort study from New Zealand and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The overall incidence of severe ROP among infants born at less than 32 weeks GA was 10 percent. Severe ROP increased from 3 to 34 percent as GA decreased from 27 to 24 weeks, respectively.</p><p>These studies, which were conducted in resource-rich countries, suggest that infants born at &ge;32 weeks are not at risk for developing ROP. In addition, most infants born at &gt;28 weeks who develop ROP have mild disease that does not require treatment.</p><p>In resource-limited settings, infants who develop severe ROP may be larger and have a greater estimated GA than those in resource-rich settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A survey of ophthalmologists from countries with low, moderate, and high levels of development found that the mean BW of infants with severe ROP was greater in infants in developing countries than in developed countries (900 versus 750 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similarly, the mean GA of infants with severe ROP was greater in developing countries than in developed countries (26 to 33.5 versus 25 weeks).</p><p>The diagnosis of ROP appears to be increasing. In one study, incidence of ROP (any stage) increased from 12.8 per 1000 low BW (BW &lt;1500 g) infants in 1990 to 125.5 per 1000 low BW infants in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The authors attributed the increased incidence to increased neonatal survival, improved awareness of ROP, and implementation of guidelines on ROP screening.

However, more than 50 separate risk factors have been identified. In multivariate analysis, low BW, low GA, assisted ventilation for longer than one week, surfactant therapy, high blood transfusion volume, cumulative illness severity, low caloric intake, hyperglycemia, and insulin therapy, have been independently associated with higher rates of ROP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/31-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-38</a>]. Breastmilk feeding appears to play a protective role in preventing ROP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In addition, infants with trisomy 21 appear to be at a lower risk for ROP compared with other infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Other possible risk factors include sepsis, fluctuations in blood gas measurements, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, systemic fungal infection, and early administration of erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/31,32,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,42</a>]. Poor longitudinal weight gain and elevated serum concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 have also been used to identify infants at risk for ROP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/16,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,43,44</a>].

However, ROP is not the only consideration in determining the optimal target oxygen level in preterm infants. Excessive reduction of target oxygenation saturation has been associated with increased mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants#H197747685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal target oxygen levels for preterm infants&quot;, section on 'High versus low SpO2 targets'</a>.)</p><p>Infection may worsen the course of ROP. In one study of affected infants, those with candidemia were more likely to reach threshold ROP and require surgical intervention (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% CI 1.7-32.1) compared with those without candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Infection was also associated with poor outcome following laser photocoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP) provides a uniform approach to documenting the extent and severity of disease and is described in detail in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This system facilitates communication among care providers and promotes collaborative clinical investigation. Four features are evaluated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zone &ndash; Describes the disease location on the retinal surface in relation to the disc, from the central zone (I) to the outer crescent (zone III).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage &ndash; Describes the severity from mildest disease (flat white line of demarcation [stage 1]) to most severe (total retinal detachment [stage 5]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extent &ndash; Described by dividing the retinal surface in 12 sections, similar to hours of a clock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence or absence of plus disease, the most important indicator of disease severity.</p><p/><p>&quot;Threshold ROP&quot; is a term that was previously used to describe the threshold at which treatment was needed. However, treatment is now initiated when the infant develops high-risk prethreshold ROP, also called &quot;type I ROP.&quot; Type I ROP is defined as any of the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-treatment-and-prognosis#H1125574223\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any stage ROP with plus disease in zone I</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 ROP without plus disease in zone I</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 or 3 ROP with plus disease in zone II</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of ROP is more correlated with postmenstrual age (PMA) than postnatal age. ROP typically begins approximately 34 weeks PMA, although it may be seen as early as 30 to 32 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a large natural history study, stages 1, 2, and 3 ROP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 2</a>) occurred at a median PMA of 34.3, 35.4, and 36.6 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>ROP advances irregularly until 40 to 45 weeks PMA but resolves spontaneously in the majority of infants. In a natural history study, in which two-thirds of infants with birth weight (BW) &le;1250 g developed some degree of ROP, treatment for severe disease was needed in only 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Regression of ROP also depends upon PMA and the location of disease. In one report of 766 children from the natural history study, involution began at a mean PMA of 38.6 weeks, and before 44 weeks in 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The outcome was favorable in 99 percent of infants when ROP resolved by moving from zone II to III. Partial or total retinal detachment was never seen when ROP was limited to zone III in serial examinations.</p><p>Ocular outcome is typically poor in infants with severe untreated ROP. This was evaluated at 5.5 years corrected age in infants with BW &le;1250 g who were enrolled in the Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Among untreated eyes, poor structural outcomes (eg, central retinal fold, severe retinal detachment) occurred in 3.1 percent of eyes, and poor Snellen visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">(20/200</span> or worse) occurred in 5.1 percent of eyes. All infants with a poor structural outcomes and nearly all poor visual acuity outcomes had a history of severe ROP (zone II ROP involving &gt;6 clock hours of stage 3+ disease or zone I ROP). Poor visual acuity occurred in only 2 of 110 eyes (1.8 percent) when ROP was observed only in zone III.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The screening evaluation consists of a comprehensive eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist with expertise in neonatal disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The pupil must be dilated in order to visualize the vitreous and retina. We recommend instillation in the eye of a combination eyedrop (Cyclomydril, which contains weak concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenylephrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclopentolate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclopentolate</a>) 30 minutes or more before the examination. Both manipulation of the eye and the drops used to dilate the pupil can produce systemic sequelae, most notably bradycardia and cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Therefore, careful monitoring of the infant throughout the examination procedure is essential. Topical anesthetic can be used if the examining clinician prefers.</p><p>The retina is examined by looking through the pupil with an indirect ophthalmoscope with a 20 or 28 diopter condensing lens while the eyelids are retracted with a speculum. ROP is most commonly visualized in the peripheral retina, which often is obscured by the iris. In order to completely view this area, a scleral depressor is used to indent the eye externally. ROP, if present, is described using the standardized classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Alternatively, telemedicine systems can be used to identify infants with potentially severe ROP. (See <a href=\"#H3604199449\" class=\"local\">'Telemedicine screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest screening <strong>all</strong> infants with birth weight (BW) &le;1500 g or gestational age (GA) &lt;30 weeks, as well as those with BW between 1500 g and 2000 g or GA &ge;30 weeks whose clinical course places them at increased risk for ROP (as determined by the neonatologist). This practice is consistent with the 2013 Joint Statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Ophthalmology, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS), and the American Association of Certified Orthoptists (AACO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These screening criteria, however, are controversial. In a Canadian study, screening infants with a BW of &le;1200 g was a more cost-effective strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Screening for ROP is a labor-intensive process with a relatively low yield; less than 10 percent of infants who are screened require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Incorporation of postnatal risk factors into the screening guidelines may increase the yield of screening. Models using various combinations of GA, BW, postnatal weight gain, and serum IGF-1 levels to predict increased risk of severe ROP have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/43,44,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,56-59</a>]. In initial validation studies, the sensitivity of these models approached 100 percent, and the specificity ranged from 32 to 84 percent. However, in a subsequent retrospective validation, the sensitivity of one such model using weight and IGF-1 level in detecting severe ROP among Mexican infants born at &lt;32 weeks gestation was only 84.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The use of models incorporating postnatal risk factors to screen for increased risk of severe ROP has the potential to reduce the number of infants requiring ophthalmologic examinations.

It is a common cause of potentially preventable childhood blindness in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence and severity of ROP increase with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Classification for ROP provides a uniform approach to documenting the extent and severity of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81495 \">figure 2</a>). It is based upon four features: zone, stage, extent, and presence or absence of plus disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ROP typically begins approximate 34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), but may be seen as early as 30 to 32 weeks. It advances irregularly until 40 to 45 weeks PMA, but resolves spontaneously in the majority of infants. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest screening for ROP in <strong>all</strong> infants with BW &le;1500 g or GA of &lt;30 weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, screening is warranted in select infants with BW between 1500 g and 2000 g or GA of &ge;30 weeks whose clinical course places them at increased risk for ROP (as determined by the neonatologist). The screening evaluation consists of a comprehensive eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist with expertise in neonatal disorders. Alternatively, telemedicine systems can be used to identify infants with potentially severe ROP. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3604199449\" class=\"local\">'Telemedicine screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We initiate screening examinations at 30 weeks PMA for infants born at 22 to 26 weeks and at 4 weeks of chronologic age for children born at &ge;27 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77995 \">table 1</a>). Additional examinations are performed at intervals of one to three weeks, depending on the severity of ROP and the health of the infant. Screening examinations continue until the risk of serious disease has passed, ROP regresses and the vasculature matures, or treatment is needed.
