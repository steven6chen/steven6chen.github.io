Depending on the stress test modality, ischemia may manifest in the form of symptoms, hemodynamic findings, electrocardiographic abnormalities, stress-induced perfusion defects, or regional wall motion abnormalities. </p><p>In patients with known or suspected CHD, the presence and extent of ischemia on stress testing are used to guide medical therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> determine the need for further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Thus, factors that impact the sensitivity and specificity of stress testing for the detection of ischemia may lead to either patients not receiving appropriate therapy or to unnecessary procedures and treatment with their attendant risks and costs, respectively. Many factors (eg, pre-existing electrocardiographic abnormalities, sex, body habitus, etc) can affect a stress test&rsquo;s ability to accurately identify myocardial ischemia.</p><p>The interaction between major cardiovascular medications, dietary factors (namely items containing caffeine), and stress testing and our recommendations for continuing or discontinuing the individual drug or dietary component will be discussed here. Indications and procedures for stress testing are discussed separately.

Vasodilator-stress induced manifestations of CHD depend on a hyperemic coronary blood flow differential between normal and abnormal coronary arteries, and are not dependent on increasing heart rate, blood pressure, or contractility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise ECG testing: Performing the test and interpreting the ECG results&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-echocardiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress echocardiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the presence of myocardial ischemia on stress testing generally correlates with the extent and severity of angiographic epicardial coronary artery stenosis, in a subset of patients, microvascular dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lesions not visible by standard invasive coronary angiography may produce myocardial ischemia on stress testing. Thus, a positive stress test in the absence of angiographic stenosis is not always a false positive test given the limitations of conventional coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac syndrome X: Angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the goals of medical and procedural therapies to treat CHD is to alleviate symptoms by reducing myocardial ischemia. As such, the goal of stress testing in patients with established (and treated) CHD is to consider the effectiveness of therapy, and this goal should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to continue or discontinue medications for stress testing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many factors influence a stress test&rsquo;s ability to identify myocardial ischemia. For the exercise electrocardiogram, common factors that affect the sensitivity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specificity include pre-existing electrocardiographic abnormalities, workload, sex, and prior coronary revascularization. For most imaging modalities, large body habitus may be associated with artifacts and limitations that can reduce both the sensitivity and the specificity of the test. Thus, although certain medications and dietary elements may affect the performance of both exercise and pharmacologic stress testing, a comprehensive understanding of the limitations of invasive coronary angiography in identifying CHD as well as a review of other factors that may affect test performance are crucial to clinical decision making.

Rarely, if the stress test is being performed primarily to diagnose the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extent of coronary heart disease (CHD), we will withhold certain medication(s) prior to stress testing (eg, methylxanthines, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers) in order to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but only after weighing the risks and benefits of withholding the medication(s) and considering possible alternatives.</p><p>The decision to continue or discontinue any medication(s) or to make certain dietary modifications prior to stress testing should be made on an individual basis. Factors involved in this decision include the indication for stress testing, indication for any medication(s) the patient is taking which may need to be stopped, and the potential harm to the patient from temporarily discontinuing the medication(s).</p><p>To obtain the maximal benefit of stopping any medication(s), the medication(s) should be withheld for four to five half-lives <strong>prior to</strong> the stress test being performed. Discontinuation of therapies for four to five half-lives will reverse the hemodynamic impact of antianginal treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. This can be accomplished, when practical and safe for the patient, by withholding antianginal medications such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates for at least 48 hours prior to a diagnostic stress test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-the-effect-of-medications-and-methylxanthines/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3068048437\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS THAT MAY REDUCE TEST SENSITIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of medications and substances (eg, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, caffeine, etc) that may impact the sensitivity of stress testing. In general, these medications impact heart rate, blood pressure, or both, with the notable exception of methylxanthines, which impact vasodilator stress testing via their impact on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> 2A receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2443647216\"><span class=\"h2\">Methylxanthines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methylated xanthines (ie, methylxanthines) should be withheld prior to stress testing with vasodilator agents.

In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study to investigate the effects of caffeine on radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), individuals with at least one segment with a reversible defect received caffeine tablets (200 or 400 mg) or placebo 90 minutes before a repeat <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regadenoson-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regadenoson</a> stress SPECT five days after the initial study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-the-effect-of-medications-and-methylxanthines/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mean number of segments with reversible defects decreased in both groups who received caffeine, compared with no significant change in the placebo group. </p><p>These findings are generally in agreement with nonrandomized smaller human studies and animal experiments.
