At this time, her ovaries stop releasing eggs and stop making the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age is 51.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637417\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I am going through menopause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women start to wonder about menopause when their periods start to change. If you are going through menopause, you might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have periods more or less often than usual (for example, every 5 to 6 weeks instead of every 4)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have bleeding that lasts for fewer days than before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skip one or more periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes or depression (described below)</p><p/><p>If your uterus has been removed, but you still have your ovaries, it might be tough to tell when you are going through menopause. Still, women who do not have a uterus can have menopause symptoms. If your ovaries were removed before the usual age of menopause, you had what doctors call &quot;surgical menopause.&quot; That just means that you went through it early, because your ovaries were removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637424\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of menopause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women go through menopause without symptoms. But most have 1 or more of these symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hot flashes</strong> &ndash; Hot flashes feel like a wave of heat that starts in your chest and face and then moves through your body. Hot flashes usually start happening before you stop having periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Night sweats</strong> &ndash; When hot flashes happen during sleep, they are called &quot;night sweats.&quot; They can make it hard to get a good night's sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep problems</strong> &ndash; During the transition to menopause, some women have trouble falling or staying asleep. This can happen even if night sweats are not a problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal dryness</strong> &ndash; Menopause can cause the vagina and tissues near the vagina to become dry and thin. This can be uncomfortable or make sex painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depression</strong> &ndash; During the transition to menopause, many women start having symptoms of depression or anxiety. That's especially true for women who have been depressed before. Depression symptoms include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sadness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Losing interest in doing things</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleeping too much or too little</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trouble concentrating or remembering things</strong> &ndash; This might be caused by lack of sleep that often happens at menopause, or by the lack of estrogen. Some experts suspect that estrogen is important for good brain function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637431\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your periods start changing and you are 45 or older, you do not need to see your doctor or nurse. But you should see your doctor or nurse if you have symptoms that really bother you. For instance, you should see your doctor if you cannot sleep because of night sweats, if it is hard to work because of your hot flashes, or if you feel sad or blue and don't seem to enjoy things anymore.</p><p>You should also see your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your period more often than every 3 weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have very heavy bleeding during your period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have spotting between your periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have been through menopause (have gone 12 months without a period) and start bleeding again, even if it's just a spot of blood</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637438\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for menopause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a test that can point to menopause. But doctors usually use that test only in women who are too young to be in menopause or who have special circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637445\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I still get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As long as you are still having periods, even if they do not happen often, you could get pregnant. If you have sex and do not want to get pregnant, use some form of birth control. If you have not had a period <strong>for a full year</strong>, it is probably safe to say you have been through menopause and can no longer get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637452\"><span class=\"h1\">How are the symptoms of menopause treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormones</strong> <strong>(estrogen)</strong> &ndash; The hormone estrogen is the most effective treatment for menopause symptoms. Women who no longer have a uterus can take estrogen by itself. Women with a uterus must take estrogen with another hormone, called progesterone. Experts think these hormones are effective and safe for many women in their 40s and 50s with symptoms of menopause. If you want to take hormones, ask your doctor or nurse if it is an option. You should not take hormones if you have had breast cancer, a heart attack, a stroke, or a blood clot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who have vaginal dryness without other symptoms of menopause can try &quot;vaginal estrogen.&quot; Vaginal estrogen is any form of estrogen that goes directly into the vagina. It comes in creams, tablets, or a flexible ring. Vaginal estrogen comes in small doses that don't increase the levels of estrogen in other parts of the body very much.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ospemifene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ospemifene</a> (brand name: Osphena) &ndash; This medicine is similar to estrogen, but is not estrogen. It comes as a pill you take once a day. It helps relieve vaginal dryness caused by menopause, but it can also cause hot flashes. It is for women who have trouble using vaginal estrogen or prefer not to use a vaginal medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antidepressants</strong> &ndash; Some types of antidepressants can ease hot flashes and depression. Even women who are not depressed can take them to help with hot flashes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-seizure medicine</strong> &ndash; One of the medicines used to prevent seizures seems to help some women with hot flashes &ndash; even if they do not have seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637459\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to reduce the symptoms of menopause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are some steps you can try (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82045 \">table 1</a>). But ask your doctor before you take any &quot;natural remedies.&quot; Some natural remedies might not be safe, especially for women who have a history of breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637466\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to protect my bones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take calcium and vitamin D supplements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be active (exercise helps keep bones strong)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor when you should start having bone density tests</p><p/><p>If needed, your doctor can prescribe medicines to help keep your bones strong.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538637473\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopause-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Menopause (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Menopausal hormone therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonhormonal-treatments-for-menopausal-symptoms-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonhormonal treatments for menopausal symptoms (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
