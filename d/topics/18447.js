There are significant clinical and genomic differences between melanomas of the uvea, conjunctiva, skin, and other sites. </p><p>The initial management of uveal and conjunctival melanoma is discussed in this section. The management of metastatic uveal melanoma is discussed separately.

Approximately 95 percent of uveal melanomas arise from the ciliary body <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> choroid, and approximately 5 percent arise in the iris. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971333074\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveal melanomas often present without symptoms, being discovered on a routine eye exam. Approximately one-half of patients will present with visual symptoms such as flashes, floaters, or visual field defects. </p><p>The diagnosis of uveal melanoma is based upon funduscopic examination by an experienced clinician, which is followed by further characterization with specialized noninvasive testing techniques, such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography. The most common simulating lesion in the differential diagnosis of uveal melanoma is a uveal nevus, and the two cannot always be distinguished with certainty on clinical examination due to an overlap in size between small melanomas and large nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The differential diagnosis of uveal melanoma also includes metastasis to the uvea, especially from lung and breast cancers, which can be the first manifestation of an occult primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The funduscopic and ultrasonographic features of uveal tumors usually allow the diagnosis to be determined noninvasively. In approximately 5 percent of cases, however, a diagnostic biopsy is needed to distinguish an atypical uveal melanoma from a metastatic tumor, hemorrhagic lesion, or other simulating lesion. </p><p>Fine needle aspiration biopsy is now performed in the vast majority of patients with uveal melanoma for molecular prognostic testing, which can be used to customize metastatic surveillance testing and to stratify high-risk patients into clinical trials. The molecular characteristics of the tumor may influence the choice of initial management in selected cases.

Research has identified factors that can predict which nevi are most likely to progress to melanoma. Most of these risk factors for choroidal nevus growth were first described in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Risks factors associated with malignancy include larger tumor size, intratumoral vascularity, invasion through the anterior chamber angle to the ciliary body, increased intraocular pressure, and secondary glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Prognosis is much better for melanomas of the iris than for melanomas of the ciliary body and choroid. Earlier diagnosis due to their readily visible location may contribute to this improved prognosis. Because of the less aggressive nature of iris melanomas, these tumors are often managed with close monitoring, although large or fast-growing tumors may require treatment with brachytherapy, proton beam radiation therapy (RT), local excision, or enucleation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3466603976\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local treatment for primary uveal melanoma is effective in preventing local recurrence in over 95 percent of cases, yet up to 50 percent of patients are at risk for metastatic disease. </p><p>The high risk of metastatic disease is thought to be due to a propensity for early micrometastasis followed by a variable latency period prior to the emergence of overt metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2208905283\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of uveal melanocytic tumors'</a> above.)</p><p>When observation is chosen, initial follow-up at two- to four-month intervals is typical. Imaging modalities commonly used in monitoring a small suspicious uveal melanocytic tumor include fundus photography, ultrasonography, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence to identify evidence of tumor growth, subretinal fluid, orange lipofuscin pigmentation, and other risk factors for malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3502222097\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is the most common treatment for primary uveal melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Since uveal melanomas are relatively radioresistant, they must be treated with high-dose radiation, usually in the form of plaque brachytherapy or charged-particle RT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177945075\"><span class=\"h4\">Plaque brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plaque brachytherapy is the most common form of RT used in the treatment of uveal melanoma worldwide. Several radioisotopes have been used, including cobalt-60 (60Co), iodine-125 (125I), iridium-192 (192Ir), palladium-103 (103Pd), and <span class=\"nowrap\">ruthenium-106/rhodium-106</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(106Ru/106Rh)</span>. Currently, 125I is the most commonly used isotope because of its favorable dosimetric characteristics across a broad range of tumor sizes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116591\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116591 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and because of its greater manufacturing accessibility with regards to application in the United States. <span class=\"nowrap\">106Ru/106Rh</span> is favored by some centers in the treatment of small tumors, but this isotope is associated with an increased rate of local treatment failure in larger tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Earlier studies reported higher local recurrence rates with brachytherapy compared with charged-particle RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], but with the use of intraoperative ultrasonography for plaque localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>], the local recurrence rates with plaque brachytherapy have decreased substantially and are now similar to charged-particle RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. These findings suggest that most local recurrences after plaque brachytherapy are due to suboptimal plaque localization and undetected plaque tilting, which can be detected and corrected with intraoperative ultrasonography at plaque insertion and removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This technique is particularly important for tumors located posteriorly in the eye, where surgical access can be challenging and where the plaque is most prone to tilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The importance of local control was illustrated by a study in which cause-specific survival at 10 years was 72 percent for patients with local control following proton beam RT versus 48 percent for those with local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Consensus opinion guidelines for the use of radioactive plaque therapy have been published by the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], but research is ongoing into the optimal dosimetric parameters for uveal melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1996287471\"><span class=\"h4\">Charged-particle radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Charged-particle RT (protons, carbon ions, helium ions) is the second most common form of RT used to treat uveal melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/42,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,54-56</a>]. The physical properties of charged particles allow increased dose targeting at the end of the beam range and a sharp decrease in the dose of the radiation beam beyond the targeted area (the Bragg peak effect) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50758 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Nevertheless, charged-particle RT can result in collateral damage to ocular structures such as the lashes, lacrimal gland, cornea, iris, lens, retina, and optic nerve.

Associated ocular radiation complications are slightly different, with greater anterior eye complications with charged-particle RT and with greater visual acuity loss and immediate procedural discomfort with plaque brachytherapy. One circumstance in which charged-particle RT has an advantage over plaque brachytherapy is when the melanoma is encircling the optic nerve in a so-called &quot;circumpapillary&quot; configuration, where it is not possible to place a plaque completely around the tumor. Charged-particle RT also has dosimetric advantages when the tumor basal dimensions are too large to accommodate a plaque. Normally, such large tumors are treated with enucleation, but eye preservation may be desired in occasional situations, especially for patients with poor vision in the contralateral eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3960966769\"><span class=\"h4\">Photon stereotactic radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Linear-accelerator-adapted stereotactic RT has also been used to treat uveal melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].

Radiation optic neuropathy presents initially with optic disc swelling and hemorrhages, and later evolves to optic atrophy with disc pallor.</p><p>Risk factors for visually significant radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy include proximity of the tumor to the optic disc and fovea, increased tumor thickness, tumor-associated retinal detachment, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. </p><p>The radiation complication most commonly resulting in secondary enucleation is neovascular glaucoma, wherein neovascularization of the iris is caused by the elaboration of angiogenic factors by an ischemic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronically detached retina, leading to closure of the anterior chamber angle and increased intraocular pressure. One study of patients treated with charged-particle RT reported five-year rates of neovascular glaucoma and neovascular-glaucoma-associated enucleation of 12.7 and 4.9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Risk factors for neovascular glaucoma include larger tumor diameter and thickness, increased patient age, chronic retinal detachment, and greater tumor vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4002136547\"><span class=\"h4\">Treatment of ocular radiation complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation-induced cataracts and dry eye can be managed by conventional ophthalmic means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p>The management of radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy, and neovascular glaucoma has been more challenging. Radiation causes endothelial cell loss and capillary closure, leading to retinal ischemia and the elaboration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other pro-angiogenic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Attempted treatments have included photodynamic therapy, laser photocoagulation, oral pentoxyphylline, hyperbaric oxygen, periocular or intravitreal injection of corticosteroids, and more recently, intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. </p><p>While none of these treatments is curative or preventative, promising results have been observed for intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy in maintaining or improving visual function in some patients with radiation maculopathy. Intraocular anti-VEGF therapy, often combined with panretinal laser photocoagulation to reduce the production of pro-angiogenic factors from an ischemic retina, has also improved the management of neovascular glaucoma and decreased the rate of secondary enucleation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The risk of neovascular glaucoma can also be reduced by prompt surgical repair of postradiation retinal detachment using vitrectomy techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2653248937\"><span class=\"h3\">Other noninvasive techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H809595543\"><span class=\"h4\">Transpupillary thermotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), also called diode laser hyperthermia, combines three features to induce deep-penetrating tumor necrosis: (1) a modified infrared diode laser, typically at a wavelength of 810 nanometers, that allows deep tissue penetration, (2) a large spot size, which decreases the risk of acute burns to the retina and tumor, and (3) a low-energy, long-duration technique that allows the entire tumor to gradually heat up to approximately 45 to 60&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Despite these improvements over laser photocoagulation, TTT is only used as a primary treatment in tumors up to approximately 3 mm in thickness, and it is associated with significant complications, such as retinal vascular occlusions, macular edema, epiretinal membrane, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

However, photocoagulation is associated with visually significant adverse effects, including retinal vascular occlusions, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Furthermore, local recurrences are common due to the inability of this method to destroy tumor cells below the surface.

Additionally, local tumor recurrence in the eye <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> orbit is more common with these techniques than with more conventional forms of treatment.</p><p>For these reasons, and because modern RT techniques offer a reasonable, if not superior, alternative, enthusiasm for local resection has waned in recent years.

However, retrospective studies comparing enucleation with RT did not show a survival advantage for enucleation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-92</a>].</p><p>In a large prospective clinical trial, the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) compared 1317 patients with medium-sized choroidal melanoma randomly assigned to enucleation versus 125I brachytherapy with overall survival as the primary outcome measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Five-, 10-, and 12-year rates of death with a histopathologically confirmed melanoma metastasis were 10, 18, and 21 percent, respectively, in the 125I brachytherapy arm and 11, 17, and 17 percent, respectively, in the enucleation arm, and there was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two groups. No comparable study has been performed for charged-particle RT, but it is generally assumed that the outcome would be similar. </p><p>Enucleation is now generally reserved for patients who would not be expected to have a favorable outcome with RT, such as those with large tumors, marked extrascleral extension, neovascular glaucoma, extensive retinal detachment, or poor visual potential, or for select patients who prefer enucleation. Fortunately, the quality of life for patients undergoing enucleation appears to be similar to that for those treated with RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].
