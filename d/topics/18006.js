While central nervous system (CNS) disease must be managed to prevent neurologic morbidity and preserve quality of life, the survival of patients with secondary CNS lymphoma depends upon control of both CNS and systemic disease sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, an effective treatment for secondary CNS lymphoma must address both compartments.</p><p>Treatment options for patients with secondary CNS lymphoma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose intravenous (IV) chemotherapy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy to sites of radiographically apparent symptomatic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose corticosteroids</p><p/><p>The majority of cases of secondary CNS lymphoma derive from histologically high-grade systemic lymphomas such as diffuse-large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Burkitt lymphoma. The evidence for various treatment options reviewed below is derived primarily from&nbsp;patients with relapsed DLBCL in the CNS. Less commonly, low grade systemic lymphomas (eg, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) involve the CNS secondarily.&nbsp;Treatment of advanced disease in such patients should be individualized and is not further addressed in this topic.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of secondary high-grade CNS lymphoma as well as prophylaxis of CNS lymphoma in high-risk patients will be discussed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of secondary CNS lymphoma and the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14776217\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment of secondary CNS lymphoma is unknown, and there is variation in clinical practice. Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials, when available. The majority of information regarding treatment comes from retrospective analyses, and very few controlled studies have been performed. A choice among treatment modalities must take into consideration the patient&rsquo;s functional status, burden of disease, and the therapy&rsquo;s side effect profile.</p><p>Our general approach depends upon the site of disease and patient-related factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with parenchymal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leptomeningeal involvement, we suggest the use of high-dose intravenous chemotherapy rather than intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This preference places a high value on our clinical experience with high-dose intravenous chemotherapy and the avoidance of lumbar puncture or Ommaya reservoir placement and access. Alternatively, some clinicians place an Ommaya reservoir for patients with documented CSF involvement to allow for the direct administration of chemotherapy into the CSF in addition to systemic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H14774969\" class=\"local\">'Systemic chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14774983\" class=\"local\">'Intrathecal therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Selected patients who attain a complete or partial response may be considered for high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic cell rescue, ideally in the setting of a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H14776354\" class=\"local\">'High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy is usually reserved for patients who have failed intravenous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrathecal chemotherapy, those with bulky parenchymal or spinal involvement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who have a functional status that limits their ability to receive intravenous or intrathecal chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H14775004\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose corticosteroids can be used for temporary symptomatic relief and may be used in conjunction with radiation therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H14776249\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14776224\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMATIC THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14776249\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids are commonly used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of NHL. They can result in temporary reversal of neurologic deficits from secondary CNS involvement as well. In addition, they may improve headache and radicular pain more effectively than analgesics. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> is the most commonly used preparation, and is often given at a starting dose of 4 mg orally four times per day. If radiation treatment is contemplated, some radiation oncologists prefer to continue corticosteroids until the radiation course has been completed. The dose can then be tapered.</p><p>Because treatment with corticosteroids may delay or interfere with diagnosis and alter the histopathology of the tumor, it is important that they not be used before pathologic confirmation of biopsy results. If necessary, patients with symptomatic edema or increased intracranial pressure can be initially treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>.

As with other brain tumors, we reserve the use of anticonvulsants for patients with documented seizure activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14774969\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose systemic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>) allows for the uniform distribution of chemotherapy throughout the neuraxis and optimal penetration of brain tissue remote from CSF spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. High dose systemic methotrexate (MTX) is commonly used for the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma and appears to have efficacy in secondary involvement of the CNS with NHL. However, high-dose systemic therapy carries with it the risk of systemic toxicity that local treatment with intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy or radiation therapy largely avoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Patients with combined CNS and systemic relapse had a poor response to both MTX and other therapies and worse overall survival.</p><p>There is more limited experience with MTX-based combination therapy. As an example, a retrospective study of 20 patients with CNS relapse of NHL evaluated the use of intravenous MTX (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> (1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The overall response rate was 90 percent, with 60 percent achieving a complete response or unconfirmed complete response. At a median follow-up of 14.9 months, the median time to neurologic progression was 8.9 months and the median overall survival was not reached.</p><p>The ideal dose of MTX to control CNS disease is unknown. Doses greater than or equal to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> are generally felt to achieve adequate CNS and cerebrospinal fluid penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Our own approach is to provide higher-dose IV MTX (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> over four hours) such as that commonly used for primary CNS lymphoma. We administer MTX every 14 days with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> rescue until the patient achieves a complete response or treatment failure. No data have yet been obtained to prove the superiority or inferiority of this approach.

CD20 is expressed by most B cells but not neurons or glial cells. However, the role of rituximab in the treatment of CNS involvement by B cell NHL is less clear, largely because of the very limited ability of rituximab to cross the blood-brain-barrier, and because most patients have received rituximab as part of initial chemotherapy for systemic disease.</p><p>Case reports and single-arm prospective trials have included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in the treatment of newly diagnosed or relapsed primary CNS lymphoma, and suggest that it crosses the blood-brain-barrier and has activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. If a regimen that incorporates rituximab is used, clinicians must be aware that rituximab therapy imposes a risk of hepatitis B reactivation among patients positive for HBsAg or anti-HBc. The risk of hepatitis B reactivation is discussed in more detail separately.

The experience to date suggests that a subset of patients may achieve long-term survival, which is rare with standard chemotherapy. Larger trials are necessary to clarify the role of this approach in a broader patient population; until further data become available, we consider high-dose chemotherapy with autologous HCT as an option in young, fit patients who have responded to induction therapy.</p><p>In addition to several retrospective series, two prospective studies have evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of this approach in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>].</p><p>In the first prospective multicenter study, 30 adult patients (median age 58 years, range, 29 to 65) with systemic NHL and parenchymal brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leptomeningeal relapse were enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Intravenous administration of most chemotherapy drugs is only able to achieve a CSF to serum drug concentration ratio &lt;10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because the volume of distribution in the CSF is much smaller than that of plasma, relatively small IT doses are adequate. In addition, the clearance half-lives for most chemotherapeutic drugs are longer in CSF than in plasma. Thus, the IT route affords prolonged drug exposure at high concentrations, with minimal systemic toxicity.</p><p>Options for IT administration include lumbar puncture (LP) and Ommaya reservoir instillation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration via LP is inconvenient for patients, often requires multiple injections each week, and is associated with a significant rate of inadvertent drug injection into the epidural space or soft tissues.

In addition, radiation therapy is localized therapy. Effective treatment for secondary CNS lymphoma must address meningeal, parenchymal, and systemic components of the disease. Radiation therapy remains an option for the palliative treatment of patients who are not candidates for high dose systemic chemotherapy. In addition, radiation therapy is commonly administered in conjunction with chemotherapy for patients with radiographically visible, symptomatic disease, particularly in the spinal cord. </p><p>Chemotherapy has limited penetration into bulky disease. As an example, in one study only one of 11 patients (9 percent) with parenchymal brain involvement achieved a complete response (CR) with chemotherapy alone versus a 33 percent CR rate in patients with leptomeningeal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Involved-field radiation therapy allows for the treatment of bulky disease that would not usually respond to chemotherapy. </p><p>Although one would prefer to treat the full extent of leptomeningeal disease, craniospinal irradiation is associated with significant neurologic and bone marrow toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The latter may mandate cessation of radiation therapy and may make additional chemotherapy unsafe. Involved-field radiation therapy avoids the toxicity of craniospinal irradiation. With this approach, daily fractions of 2 to 4 Gy to a total dose of 20 to 40 Gy are administered to areas that are symptomatic or involved according to imaging studies.</p><p>Immediate complications from radiation are few and include headaches, hair loss, and skin irritation. In patients with significant mass effect, corticosteroids should be administered to avoid cerebral edema and symptomatic elevation of intracranial pressure. Acute symptoms of confusion, caused by radiation-induced brain edema, are usually mild and transient. Occasionally, it may be necessary to temporarily increase the dose of corticosteroids to reduce the resulting edema.
