The diagnosis and management of pancreatic and duodenal injuries can be challenging. The retroperitoneal location of these organs makes signs and symptoms typical of intra-abdominal injuries less obvious, they are frequently associated with concomitant injuries, and they have high complication and mortality rates. Although the majority of injuries to the pancreas and duodenum are low grade and can be managed with minimal surgical intervention, complex injuries require timely pancreatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duodenal resection and reconstruction. </p><p>The mechanisms, associated injuries, diagnosis, and management of duodenal and pancreatic injury are reviewed here. The general approach to blunt and penetrating chest and abdominal trauma is discussed elsewhere.

The first portion is transversely oriented, beginning at the pylorus and ending at the common bile duct superiorly and the gastroduodenal artery inferiorly. The second portion runs inferiorly to the ampulla of Vater, the third portion runs transversely to the superior mesenteric artery and vein, and the fourth portion extends to the point where the duodenum emerges from the retroperitoneum to join the jejunum at the left border of the second lumbar vertebra. </p><p>Significant portions of the duodenum lie directly over the spinal column, and it is bordered anteriorly by the liver, colon, and stomach. The duodenal sweep is bordered by the gallbladder laterally and the head of the pancreas medially. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651340857\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pancreas is a compound exocrine and endocrine gland located in the retroperitoneum at the level of the second lumbar vertebrae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53979\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53979 \">figure 1</a>). Exocrine pancreatic secretion is composed of enzymes, water, electrolytes and bicarbonate, which are delivered to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct of Wirsung and aid with digestion. Insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin are secreted by the islets of Langerhans, A cells, and D cells, respectively. Removal of 90 percent of the mass of the pancreas can be performed without resulting in diabetes. </p><p>The pancreas is divided into five parts, including the head, uncinate process, neck, body, and tail. The head of the pancreas lies to the right of the superior mesenteric artery. The uncinate process is a variable posterolateral extension of the head that passes behind the retropancreatic vessels and lies anterior to the inferior vena cava and aorta. The neck is defined as the portion of the gland overlying the superior mesenteric vessels. The body and tail lie to the left of the mesenteric vessels; there is no meaningful anatomic division between the body and tail. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184654688\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct to drain into the duodenum via the major papilla (ampulla of Vater) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63728 \">picture 1</a>). The anatomy of these ducts can vary. In 85 percent of individuals, both the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct enter the duodenum through a common channel. In 5 percent of patients, both ducts enter the duodenum through the same ampulla but via separate channels. In the remaining 10 percent of patients, each duct enters the duodenum through a separate ampulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The entry of the common bile duct into the pancreatic tissue posteriorly can also vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52079 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184654538\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial supply to the duodenum and pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53700 \">figure 4</a>) is derived from the celiac artery providing the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (anterior and posterior branches), and the superior mesenteric artery providing the inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (anterior and posterior branches). The right gastric artery also gives branches to the duodenum and the splenic artery and supplies primarily the body and tail of the pancreas. The venous drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65365 \">figure 5</a>) follows the arteries to provide tributaries to the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein, which drain into the portal vein.</p><p>The duodenum and pancreas are innervated by sympathetic fibers from the splanchnic nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73063 \">figure 6</a>) and parasympathetic fibers from the vagus, both of which give rise to intrapancreatic periacinar nerve plexuses. The parasympathetic fibers stimulate exocrine and endocrine function, whereas the sympathetic fibers have an inhibitory effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651341015\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the patient with blunt or penetrating injury are based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of acute trauma, many patients cannot relate their symptoms or medical history due to altered mental status (eg, neurologic injury, intoxication) or because they are intubated and sedated. Every attempt should be made to identify preexisting medical conditions by contacting the patient's primary care physician or family members. The presence of significant medical comorbidities and medical conditions requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation should be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Patient assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Although Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is a useful, validated test for detecting hemoperitoneum in the setting of blunt trauma, it is not reliable as a screening test for duodenal or pancreatic injury. Approximately one-third of patients with retroperitoneal injuries including injuries of the duodenum and pancreas will have normal FAST examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Although diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) does not sample the retroperitoneal space, most patients with duodenal or pancreatic injuries have associated injuries that may be detected by DPL; however, the test is not sufficiently specific for detecting duodenal or pancreatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184656132\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk for injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duodenal and pancreatic injuries are uncommon, occurring in 3 to 5 percent of patients sustaining abdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Injury to these retroperitoneal structures may be suspected based upon the injury mechanism and the identification of injury to organs in close proximity to the duodenum or pancreas. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184654907\"><span class=\"h3\">Injury mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 75 to 85 percent of blunt injuries to the duodenum and pancreas are caused by motor vehicle collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. The mechanism is typically due to crushing of these fixed retroperitoneal organs between the vertebral column and steering wheel or seatbelt. The remainder of blunt duodenal and pancreatic injuries results from falls and assaults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. Blunt duodenal and pancreatic injury can also be due to bicycle accidents in which the duodenum and pancreas are crushed between the spinal column and bicycle (or motorcycle) handlebar. </p><p>Any implement or missile that enters the abdomen can injure the pancreas or duodenum. Gunshot or shotgun wounds are more likely to result in injury compared with stab wounds because of their high energy. However, depending upon the girth of the victim and force applied, even a short implement that penetrates the upper abdomen can cause duodenal or pancreatic injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184654704\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scope of injuries associated with pancreatic and duodenal trauma is illustrated in the following retrospective reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 1153 cases of duodenal injury, there were 3047 associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The liver was the most commonly injured organ, accounting for 17 percent of associated injuries. Other organs injured along with the duodenum included the pancreas (12 percent), small bowel (12 percent), colon (12 percent), and stomach (9 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another review of 3465 injuries involving the pancreas, there were 7526 associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The liver was also the most commonly injured, accounting for 19 percent of associated injuries. Other organs injured along with the pancreas included the stomach (16 percent), spleen (11 percent), colon (8 percent), and duodenum (8 percent). </p><p/><p>Because of the proximity of the major vascular structures including the aorta, vena cava, and portal vein, injury to the duodenum and pancreas can be associated with exsanguinating hemorrhage. In the first review discussed above, major abdominal veins were injured in 10 percent of patients, mostly involving the inferior vena cava, and major arteries were injured in 7 percent of patients, mostly involving the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Penetrating injury is more likely to result in vascular injury, with one review documenting that 37 percent of patients with penetrating pancreatic injury had major vascular injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Major venous injuries were present in 20 percent of patients with blunt duodenal injury, but there were no associated arterial injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054843\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History and physical examination are nonspecific and are <strong>not</strong> reliable for detecting duodenal or pancreatic injury. A history of any blunt injury mechanism causing a blow or crushing injury to the midabdomen raises the suspicion for duodenal or pancreatic injury. (See <a href=\"#H184654907\" class=\"local\">'Injury mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p>Abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs on initial evaluation may indicate the presence of intra-abdominal injury but are not specific for duodenal or pancreatic injury. A physical exam finding of abdominal wall ecchymosis may be a sign that a crush injury has occurred. In a study of 117 blunt abdominal injuries due to motor vehicle accident, significantly more patients who presented with abdominal wall ecchymosis or the &quot;seatbelt sign&quot; had an intestinal injury (21 versus 2 percent), or intra-abdominal injuries requiring surgery (36 versus 4 percent) compared with those who did not have ecchymosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The thoracic and lumbar spine should be carefully palpated for spinal tenderness, which may indicate the presence of a spine fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F60907\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60907 \">image 1</a>). Approximately one-third of patients with transverse vertebral body fractures (ie, Chance fracture) of the low thoracic or lumbar spine have intra-abdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>When patients are being observed following trauma, the following clinical symptoms and signs may suggest an undiagnosed duodenal or pancreatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing abdominal pain </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing abdominal tenderness </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent emesis or inability to tolerate oral diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing leukocytosis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing amylase </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal small bowel obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal sepsis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054857\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of duodenal or pancreatic injury is made by imaging studies, typically computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen or exploratory laparotomy, as indicated by the clinical scenario.</p><p>Laboratory studies such as serum amylase and lipase are typically performed as a part of routine trauma assessment. Serum amylase or lipase cannot be used to rule out or establish a diagnosis of pancreatic injury.

In retrospective reviews, the sensitivity of CT for detecting blunt small bowel injury is reported to be as low as 59 or as high as 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. </p><p>The integrity of the pancreatic duct determines the course of treatment for injury to the pancreas, and a test with high specificity is desirable. In a multicenter study of 206 patients, the sensitivities of 16-channel and 64-channel multidetector abdominal CT were 54.0 and 52.4 percent, respectively, with specificities of 94.8 for 16-channel and 90.3 percent for 64-channel CT scanners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In spite of higher-resolution scanning, between 5 to 10 percent of pancreatic ductal injuries are missed with abdominal CT. (See <a href=\"#H2054906\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative management'</a> below.) </p><p>If the integrity of the pancreatic duct cannot be established with computed tomography, cholangiopancreatography can be performed.

For patients with symptoms of proximal bowel obstruction due to duodenal hematoma, a nasogastric tube is placed for decompression and parenteral nutrition initiated. After five to seven days, imaging should be repeated to evaluate patency of the duodenum. If the obstruction has resolved, an oral diet can be initiated. However, if the obstruction persists after 10 to 14 days, exploratory laparotomy is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

When a duodenal hematoma is seen or palpated during emergent laparotomy, it should be left intact since a majority of these patients will heal with conservative management. Although it may be tempting to evacuate the hematoma, doing so can potentially convert a partial-thickness injury to a full-thickness injury. However, in patients who have failed conservative management of duodenal hematoma, the hematoma should be decompressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2054906\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2054950\" class=\"local\">'Repair of duodenal injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Most duodenal perforations are seen upon inspection.

Full-thickness duodenal injury in the region of the ampulla indicates a need to fully evaluate the ampulla, bile ducts, and pancreatic ducts using cholangiopancreatography. (See <a href=\"#H184650930\" class=\"local\">'Evaluating ductal anatomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Because the pancreas is highly vascular, transections and major lacerations of the pancreas are easily identified as a peripancreatic hematoma during visual inspection of the retroperitoneum. All peripancreatic hematomas should be explored. Once the hematoma is decompressed, the pancreas is examined for several minutes under loupe magnification to identify leakage of clear pancreatic fluid consistent with pancreatic duct injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>If pancreatic ductal injury is suspected but is not immediately apparent, a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> intravenously) can be given to stimulate pancreatic secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Intraoperative ultrasound can also be used to detect pancreatic parenchymal or pancreatic duct injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. If a suspected pancreatic duct injury cannot be confirmed, cholangiopancreatography should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In indeterminate cases, intraoperative cholangiopancreatography can determine the presence of ductal injury but can be technically difficult to accomplish. </p><p>Intraoperative cholangiopancreatography during trauma exploration is performed through an existing duodenal wound, or via anterior duodenotomy. A catheter is directed into the common bile duct or pancreatic duct injecting 2 to 5 mL of soluble contrast into the duct while imaging using fluoroscopy or shooting a plain film. </p><p>Intraoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can also provide the necessary imaging but would require the abdomen to be closed and the patient to be repositioned in lateral decubitus position on a radiolucent table. </p><p>An alternative approach is to employ damage control techniques and obtain a postoperative study (ERCP or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram [MRCP]) to evaluate the ductal anatomy. However, positive findings may indicate the need to return to the operating room to manage the identified injuries.

Intraperitoneal packing and temporary abdominal closure are followed by fluid resuscitation, patient warming, and correction of coagulation deficits in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

For suspected pancreatic duct injuries, wide drainage is used, but if the injury is distal, a quick distal pancreatectomy can be performed. (See <a href=\"#H2057032\" class=\"local\">'Managing pancreatic injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Bleeding from the pancreas distal to the head of the pancreas can usually be controlled with packing; however, high-grade injuries to the head of the pancreas, which may also involve the duodenum, are often associated with bleeding that cannot be controlled by packing, and thus, resection without reconstruction may be needed. To resect the proximal duodenum and pancreas, the pylorus, pancreatic neck, and proximal jejunum are stapled across and transected, the common bile duct is ligated, and the biliary tract is drained using tube cholecystostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Closed-suction drains are placed to control duodenal and pancreatic secretions. Following resuscitation and stabilization, definitive resection and reconstruction (Whipple) can be performed. (See <a href=\"#H2058045\" class=\"local\">'Combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054950\"><span class=\"h2\">Repair of duodenal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of duodenal lacerations can be managed by simple procedures such as debridement and primary repair, or resection and reanastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. More complex procedures are rare but are associated with a high risk of postoperative complications, including suture line failure and anastomotic leak or small bowel fistula formation. Mortality is also increased but is often related to associated injuries and not strictly a consequence of complications related to duodenal repair. (See <a href=\"#H2055015\" class=\"local\">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low grade &ndash; Partial-thickness injuries (Grade I) are repaired by suturing the serosa in a Lembert fashion. Full-thickness duodenal lacerations (Grade II) are debrided, and the duodenum is repaired with a tension-free primary closure in one or two layers. Longitudinal injuries should be closed transversely, if possible, to minimize the potential for luminal narrowing. If the injury is judged to be too extensive for primary repair (eg, &gt;3 cm) after debridement, the injured segment should be resected and the duodenal ends brought together with a primary end-to-end duodeno-duodenostomy. Injuries to the second portion of the duodenum may not be amenable to this approach if the common bile duct or ampulla is injured, or if resection would require removal of these structures. The treatment of ampullary injuries is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2058045\" class=\"local\">'Combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate grade &ndash; As with low-grade injuries, many intermediate (Grade III) injuries can also be treated with debridement and primary closure or resection and primary anastomosis. When primary repair is not possible, surgical options include resection with reanastomosis by duodenoduodenostomy. For larger defects, a duodenojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction should be considered. Although some advocate for additional procedures to protect the repair, such as pyloric exclusion, supporting data are limited. (See <a href=\"#H184658492\" class=\"local\">'Pyloric exclusion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High grade &ndash; Injuries involving the ampulla (Grade IV, V) increase the complexity of duodenal repair. For limited injuries to the ampulla, management options include stenting or sphincteroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Avulsion of the ampulla can occur and has been successfully managed with common bile duct reimplantation using choledochoduodenostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Extensive periampullary injuries, such as intraduodenal bile duct injury, intrapancreatic bile duct injury, or Grade V injury, often require staged pancreaticoduodenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2058045\" class=\"local\">'Combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184658485\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjunctive techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several adjunctive procedures have been used in conjunction with duodenal repair with a primary aim of decreasing the likelihood of leak following repair. There is no consensus on when these procedures are indicated, and none of these techniques has demonstrated a clear benefit. Under most circumstances, these adjunctive techniques are not needed. Pyloric exclusion, duodenal decompression, and duodenal diverticularization are described briefly below. Given a lack of data, we prefer pyloric exclusion because it is more easily performed in the face of severe traumatic injuries. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184658492\"><span class=\"h4\">Pyloric exclusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyloric exclusion refers to a procedure in which the pylorus is closed for the purpose of excluding gastric secretions from the duodenal repair. Pyloric exclusion is used selectively as an adjunctive procedure to manage intermediate- or high-grade duodenal or combined injuries. (See <a href=\"#H2054950\" class=\"local\">'Repair of duodenal injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2058045\" class=\"local\">'Combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>Following duodenal repair, the pylorus is sutured closed through a longitudinal antral gastrotomy using partial-thickness absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures placed proximally into the pylorus or, alternatively, using a noncutting linear stapler applied transversely just distal to the pylorus. Once the pylorus has been closed, a loop gastrojejunostomy is performed. </p><p>The pylorus will reopen spontaneously in the majority of patients within three to six weeks, even when nonabsorbable sutures or staples are used. In a small retrospective review of 29 patients with penetrating duodenal injuries, no significant differences in clinical outcomes were seen in patients who underwent pyloric exclusion compared with those who underwent primary repair alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Although pyloric exclusion is a relatively straightforward procedure to perform, it is associated with a high incidence of marginal ulceration along the gastrojejunostomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H184658499\"><span class=\"h4\">Duodenal decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following repair, the duodenum can be decompressed in an antegrade (duodenostomy) or a retrograde (jejunostomy) fashion. The rationale for duodenal decompression is to decrease the pressure and volume of secretions in the duodenum, thereby protecting the duodenal repair. In studies that have evaluated tube enterostomy, a serosal patch or mucosal graft taken from the jejunum or stomach has often been used to reinforce the duodenal repair. </p><p>There are no randomized trials evaluating the use of duodenal decompression in patients following duodenal injury, and the outcomes of retrospective reviews are mixed. Given the lack of consistent results as illustrated in the following studies, and the risk of other complications such as duodenal fistula, we prefer not to use duodenal decompression following duodenal repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/32,38,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38,62-64</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One retrospective review of 276 patients with duodenal injuries repaired by primary closure compared 237 patients treated with tube decompression (mostly retrograde tube jejunostomy) and 57 who were not decompressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Options include debridement and wide suction drainage, extended distal pancreatectomy with division of the pancreas to the right of the superior mesenteric vessels, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. (See <a href=\"#H2058045\" class=\"local\">'Combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the high incidence of endocrine insufficiency and diabetes with removal of &gt;90 percent of the pancreas, some authors have advocated Roux-en-Y distal pancreaticojejunostomy (with oversewing of the proximal segment) for proximal duct transections (ie, central pancreatectomy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F93268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93268 \">figure 10</a>). Central pancreatectomy has an advantage over distal or subtotal pancreatectomy in preserving the tail of the pancreas and its endocrine and exocrine function, as well as the spleen. However, the risk of anastomotic leak and morbidity is significant, and some argue that a more conservative approach should be used. In a review of 134 patients with blunt pancreatic duct injury, 34 patients with proximal injuries (not Grade V) were treated with closed-suction drainage alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Complication rates were no different compared with more aggressive approaches. Favorable results have also been reported for proximal duct injury due to gunshot wounds using debridement, suture repair, and closed-suction drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. These considerations and the complexity of the procedure make central pancreatectomy unsuitable for many patients, particularly multiply injured patients. The technical aspects of central pancreatectomy are discussed elsewhere.

In some patients with combined pancreatoduodenal injuries, the duodenal injury and pancreatic injury can be approached separately using relatively simple procedures. (See <a href=\"#H2054950\" class=\"local\">'Repair of duodenal injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2057032\" class=\"local\">'Managing pancreatic injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>When combined pancreatoduodenal injuries are more extensive, the risk of postoperative pancreatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duodenal fistula is high. Adjunctive procedures should be considered to decrease the amount of secretions in the duodenum, such as pyloric exclusion or tube decompression. Of these, pyloric exclusion is the most expedient and least complex option. (See <a href=\"#H184658485\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive techniques'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with severe, combined pancreatoduodenal injury, such as when the ampulla of Vater or intrapancreatic common bile duct has been destroyed, or the head of the pancreas has been devitalized, reconstruction is impossible and resection is needed. Fortunately, this rarely occurs. A damage control approach is often needed due to other associated injuries, which necessitates a staged procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults/abstract/48,55,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55,73</a>]. The head of the pancreas and proximal duodenum can usually be resected quickly (pancreaticoduodenectomy). At the initial exploration, the pylorus, proximal jejunum, and pancreatic stump are stapled and transected. The common bile duct is ligated or a drain placed within it. The patient is stabilized in the surgical intensive care unit and, after 24 to 48 hours, brought back to the operating room for reconstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82519 \">figure 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60689 \">figure 12</a>).

The severity of injury correlates with the presence of associated injuries and increasing rates of morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2054836\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909579191\" class=\"local\">'Injury grading'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of duodenal or pancreatic injury may not be obvious upon presentation due to the retroperitoneal location of these organs. The diagnosis of low-grade injuries can be challenging, particularly in the setting of blunt trauma or when exploratory laparotomy is not immediately indicated to evaluate other injuries. (See <a href=\"#H2054843\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2054857\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is the initial imaging test used to evaluate duodenal and pancreatic injury but has only moderate sensitivity for detecting these injuries. Specificity is higher, but pancreatic ductal injuries will be missed in as many as 10 percent of patients. Cholangiopancreatography (endoscopic or magnetic resonance) may be needed to make a diagnosis of ductal injury. (See <a href=\"#H2054857\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade (I or II) <strong>blunt</strong> injuries of the duodenum and pancreas are initially managed nonoperatively rather than with operative exploration and repair. Most of these injuries heal without the need for surgical intervention, although approximately 10 percent of patients will fail nonoperative management. Nonoperative management includes bowel rest and nutritional support (enteral or parenteral). Nonoperative management has <strong>not</strong> been reported for penetrating mechanisms. (See <a href=\"#H2054906\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When duodenal or pancreatic injuries require operative intervention, relatively simple surgical techniques are often all that is needed. These include debridement of devitalized tissue, local repair of lacerations, closed-suction drainage, and, for full-thickness duodenal injury, resection and primary anastomosis. Several adjunctive techniques have been described to decrease the potential for leak following duodenal repair, but no studies have proven any benefit. (See <a href=\"#H2054950\" class=\"local\">'Repair of duodenal injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2057032\" class=\"local\">'Managing pancreatic injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of pancreatic ductal injuries depends upon the location of the injury. Distal main pancreatic duct injuries to the left of the superior mesenteric vein are managed with distal pancreatectomy. Proximal main pancreatic duct injury is managed primarily with wide closed-suction drainage. (See <a href=\"#H343177528\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic ductal injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade injuries to the pancreatic head or combined severe injuries of the duodenum and pancreas are managed with resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) and interval reconstruction. Devitalized tissue is debrided, and the pylorus, jejunum, and pancreatic stump are stapled closed. The common bile duct is ligated or drained. After an interval during which the patient is resuscitated, the patient is returned to the operating room for reconstruction (Whipple). (See <a href=\"#H2058045\" class=\"local\">'Combined pancreaticoduodenal injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality following pancreatic and duodenal injury occurs in 15 to 20 percent of patients and is related to the severity of the duodenal or pancreatic injury and other associated injuries. Complications are common and include intra-abdominal abscess, duodenal fistula, pancreatic fistula, pancreatitis, and pancreatic pseudocyst. High rates of late infectious complications occur even if the injury is diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion. These complications can usually be managed without the need to return to the operating room.
