In a prospective series of 73 children presenting to a specialty hospital with back pain for more than three months, excluding children with a history of back surgery, only 13 patients (18 percent) received a definitive diagnosis: spondylolysis with or without spondylolisthesis (nine patients), Scheuermann kyphosis (two patients), osteoid osteoma (one patient), and lumbar disc herniation (one patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A retrospective series of 116 adolescents referred to an orthopedic practice for nonmalignant back pain documented nonspecific mechanical pain in 32 patients (28 percent), scoliosis in 31 patients (27 percent), Scheuermann kyphosis in 23 patients (20 percent), spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis in 18 patients (16 percent), and other causes in 12 patients, including only two with disc herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

It may be asymptomatic but typically manifests as aching low back pain that is exacerbated by hyperextension and relieved with rest. The pain may extend into the buttocks and posterior thighs.</p><p>Examination findings include lumbosacral tenderness, particularly with extension or lateral bending, and hamstring tightness (limited passive straight-leg raising and forward bending). In addition, the patient may have a positive one-legged hyperextension test (while standing on one leg and bending backward, pain is experienced in the ipsilateral back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78320\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78320 \">picture 1</a>)), but this test is neither sensitive nor specific for spondylolysis. Spondylolysis may progress to spondylolisthesis, generally during the adolescent growth spurt. Progression is correlated with persistent back pain and lack of healing.

The observation that a history of prolonged bed rest was more common among patients with Scheuermann kyphosis than controls suggests that in some cases, the wedging may reflect compression fractures associated with transient osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. An association with sports or heavy lifting is controversial. Although these patients are generally taller than their peers, their sternal lengths have been found to be somewhat reduced, suggesting the possibility that sternal size may result in compressive stresses on the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiology &ndash; The estimated prevalence of Scheuermann kyphosis ranges from 4 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. Scheuermann kyphosis is more common among boys than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Tall boys are at increased risk for severe disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features &ndash; Scheuermann kyphosis typically occurs in early adolescence and affects the thoracic or thoracolumbar spine. It may be associated with spondylolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and rarely, myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Pain generally is subacute without a clear episode of precipitating trauma. The pain is worse after activity and at the end of the day and improves with rest. It tends to improve with skeletal maturity. However, long-term follow-up suggests an increased prevalence of back pain in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with Scheuermann kyphosis have a rigid kyphosis with a relatively sharp angulation when the child bends over, best viewed from the side of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81479\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81479 \">figure 3</a>).The curvature does not flatten with forward bending, extension, or lying supine (in contrast to the curvature of poor posture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/6,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32</a>]. There may be a compensatory increase in lumbar lordosis and tightening of the hamstrings manifest by limited passive straight leg raising and forward bending. The physical examination is neither sensitive nor specific for Scheuermann kyphosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging &ndash; Standing lateral spine radiographs are necessary for the diagnosis (anterior wedging of &ge;5&ordm; in at least three adjacent vertebral bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96735\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96735 \">image 1</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Radicular symptoms may ensue if the prolapsed material presses on a nerve root.</p><p>Degenerative disc changes (with or without disc calcification) in the absence of overt prolapse are associated with pain in some adolescents and are an incidental finding in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiology &ndash; Herniation of the nucleus pulposus is much less common in children and adolescents than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The etiology is controversial. Although disc biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis, as many as 60 percent of biopsied discs grow bacteria, usually <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. A prospective study identified <em>Kingella kingae</em> by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the oropharynx of 10 of 10 children with discitis (compared with &lt;10 percent of asymptomatic children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. <em>K. kingae</em> was also identified by PCR in blood cultures of 2 of 10 children with discitis; disc aspirations were not performed. In a study of 25 South Korean children with discitis, <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> were the most prevalent pathogens (40 and 32 percent, respectively) among the 22 patients with positive cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Despite the frequency of positive cultures, children often recover without antibiotic therapy. The current consensus, backed by scant supportive evidence, is that discitis in children usually represents low-grade infection and is on one end of the spectrum of vertebral osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/63,64,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64,66,67</a>]. In children younger than seven years, host defense systems usually are capable of overcoming the infection without assistance because the disc is richly vascularized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Occasionally, however, host defenses are overwhelmed, and complications such as abscess formation may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiology &ndash; Discitis is rare.
