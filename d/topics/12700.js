Compared with injury to other genitourinary (GU) organs, ureteral injury tends to be more often iatrogenic, occurring during pelvic surgery (gynecologic, urologic, or colorectal surgery). When they occur, the majority of traumatic ureteral injuries are due to a penetrating mechanism, predominantly in young males. Traumatic injuries are frequently associated with other severe injuries. </p><p>Ureteral injuries may not be recognized early unless they are specifically evaluated for based on clinical suspicion. Treatment may include placement of a ureteral stent or surgical repair, depending on the severity and location of injury.</p><p>An overview of the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of ureteral injuries is provided here. The diagnosis and management of upper GU tract injury, lower GU tract injury, and injury to other GU organs are discussed separately.

Similar to most trauma demographics, younger males predominate. Penetrating trauma is most common (60 to 77 percent), with gunshot wounds accounting for most injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The proximal ureter is most commonly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Blunt injury can occur and has a high incidence of associated injuries. Deceleration can result in avulsion of the ureter at the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) or distally along the ureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bilateral UPJ disruption has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2334097979\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a result of close associations with surrounding structures, traumatic ureteral injury is highly associated with concomitant injuries to surrounding structures. In one of the largest literature reviews of ureteral trauma, associated injuries were present in 91 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The median injury severity score (ISS) was higher for blunt injury (21.5 versus 16) in a review of 582 ureteral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bowel and vascular injuries were commonly associated with penetrating injury, whereas bony pelvic fracture was associated with blunt ureteral injury. These studies highlight the need to consider possible ureteral injury following significant multiple trauma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3927132670\"><span class=\"h2\">Iatrogenic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iatrogenic ureteral injuries can occur during various abdominopelvic and retroperitoneal surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], as well as during endoscopic manipulation, or dissolution of ureteral calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Recognition and treatment of ureteral injuries at the time of injury is associated with the least morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective review identified 55 patients (11 male and 44 female; mean age 54.5 years) with verified iatrogenic ureteral injury over a 16-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The majority of ureteral injuries occurred during gynecologic procedures (55 percent). The remainder of procedures were urologic (25 percent), colorectal (15 percent), and vascular (5 percent). Most iatrogenic injuries were incomplete transection, but perforation (partial or complete), ligation, or complete transection also occurred. </p><p>The incidence of injury to the ureters may be lower for a laparoscopic compared with an open surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In a review of over 90,000 colectomies, the incidence for laparoscopic colectomy was 0.53 percent compared with 0.66 percent for open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When ureteral injury does occur during laparoscopic surgery, it may be more difficult to identify intraoperatively. The risk for complications related to laparoscopic surgery may be related to the experience of the surgeon but also depends on the type of procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H860575245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3783121019\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is incumbent for the surgeon to demonstrate that due diligence was taken during the course of surgery or another procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At a minimum, when the procedure is anticipated to occur in the vicinity of the ureters, the surgeon should document that the ureters were identified and protected, or <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should provide the reason why if this is not possible (eg, adhesions, distorted anatomy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malpractice-risk-associated-with-surgical-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malpractice risk associated with surgical procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In an effort to prevent injury during surgery, prophylactic ureteral stents may be placed prior to surgery to assist with intraoperative identification of the ureter (eg, gynecologic surgery, rectosigmoid surgery, aortoiliac surgery), which is particularly important if the operative field is scarred from previous dissection. Whether stents actually prevent ureteral injury remains debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one review of 5729 colectomies, no difference was seen for those who did versus did not undergo preoperative ureteral stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

A history of rapid deceleration, multisystem abdominal trauma (eg, bowel, bladder, pelvic fracture), or penetrating trauma, and clinical features such as flank pain, flank ecchymosis, posterior rib fracture, or spine fractures, should increase suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/2,4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,16</a>]. </p><p>Some patients will not have any symptoms or external signs to suggest a ureteral injury. As such, a high index of suspicion is necessary to identify the presence of ureteral injuries. It is important to note that the absence of hematuria cannot be relied upon to exclude ureteral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Unlike renal injury, hematuria is an unreliable finding following ureteral trauma as it is present in less than one-half of patients with a ureteric injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3592024928\"><span class=\"h2\">Missed injury/delayed presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteral injuries (traumatic, iatrogenic) that are initially missed may become suspected on the basis of <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs</span> of a urine leak causing urinary ascites, urinoma, ileus, periureteral abscess, sepsis, ureteral fistula, or ureteral stricture. Symptoms may include vague malaise and <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/flank</span> pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fever, and delayed passage of <span class=\"nowrap\">stool/flatus</span>. Examination of the urine may reveal hematuria or pyuria. </p><p>One review noted that 38 percent of ureteral injuries were initially missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a separate review, among patients who underwent trauma laparotomy, 48 of 429 ureteral injuries were missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The majority of missed injuries were located in the proximal ureters, a region with less accessibility, particularly in the setting of retroperitoneal hematoma, and therefore with less likelihood of being explored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2387750438\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ureteral injury is typically made using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span>. If there is a suspicion for a ureteral injury that is not definitively proven by CT scan (initial or repeat), then cystoscopy with retrograde pyelography can aid the evaluation. </p><p>For trauma patients with indications for immediate laparotomy, the diagnosis will necessarily be made during exploration of the ureters when injury is suspected. Direct inspection of the ureters is the most sensitive method to assess for ureteral injury. Intravenous dyes (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>) can be used to assess for dye leakage along the course of the ureter. The intraoperative approach for identification of suspected iatrogenic ureteral injury is similar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H670602368\"><span class=\"h2\">CT urography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For hemodynamically stable patients with suspected ureteral injuries, we suggest using contrast-enhanced <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> CT with delayed imaging (CT urography). For penetrating trauma, a trajectory in proximity of the ureters may signal the need for evaluation of the ureters even in the absence of other signs. The advantages of CT outweigh the risks, which include contrast-related complications, radiation exposure, and the dangers of transporting a trauma patient away from the resuscitation environment into the CT scanner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>For patients taken to the operating room emergently without imaging studies, some experts have suggested that postoperative CT scan may reduce the incidence of missed injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Consider other potential injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Identification of ureteral injuries requires a delay of 5 to 10 minutes after the administration of intravenous (IV) contrast to allow contrast to reach the ureters. When the situation allows, 10-minute delayed imaging is preferred for a more complete evaluation of the upper urinary tract. In an effort to reduce radiation exposure, delayed phase imaging can be performed with a low-dose protocol and increased axial image slice thickness (5 mm). Repeated scans at a later interval may be necessary if there is poor renal excretion of IV contrast at 10 minutes. </p><p>Findings that suggest ureteral injury include nonvisualization of the ureter, contrast extravasation from the ureter, ipsilateral hydronephrosis, and poor renal excretion localized to one side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/5,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22-25</a>]. If the initial delayed images do not adequately opacify the ureters, further delayed imaging may be necessary if ureteral injury is still suspected. </p><p>To reduce radiation exposure during repeat CT imaging, we perform a low-dose &quot;CT urinoma&quot; study, which omits the parenchymal phase. This study involves a low-dose noncontrast phase followed by a delayed image phase 10 minutes after intravenous contrast administration.

The grading system relies on visual inspection of the injury to make a diagnosis since injury grades are difficult to assess using imaging alone. Rather than stratifying ureteral injuries by grade, most surgeons distinguish them based upon location of ureteral injury (upper, mid, lower), mechanism of injury (blunt versus penetrating), and severity of injury (complete versus partial transection) as these categories guide the type of surgical management necessary for repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults#H2435546541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inpatient management of upper genitourinary tract injuries in adults&quot;, section on 'Injury grading'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1867481209\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteral injuries generally will require some form of treatment, either using minimally invasive or open reconstructive techniques. Data to guide conservative management of ureteral injuries are limited; minimally invasive techniques are often necessary when this treatment strategy is pursued. Patients who are being followed conservatively who demonstrate worsened urinary extravasation on repeat imaging should be treated with placement of a ureteral stent and urethral catheter (if not already in place) to reduce pressure and promote healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

When the injury is located near a suture line (eg, bowel, vagina), or if the patient requires surgery for another reason, immediate repair can be considered. If stent placement is unsuccessful or not possible, percutaneous nephrostomy should be performed. Aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drainage of an associated abscess may be necessary if ureteral stenting or a nephrostomy tube does not successfully contain the ureteral injury. For complicated injuries with abscess or urinoma formation, percutaneous nephrostomy with periureteral drainage is preferred. </p><p>In general, iatrogenic urinary tract injury recognized during surgery should also be repaired intraoperatively when identified rather than delaying until after surgery or performing a second procedure, if possible.

If placement of a ureteral stent is not possible or if stent placement fails to adequately divert the urine, then a percutaneous nephrostomy tube should be placed. If there is a large urinoma, a periureteral tube can be placed subsequently.

Most patients will present with fever, chills, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flank pain 7 to 10 days after acute injury. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan with delayed images provides the diagnosis. Treatment involves placement of a perinephric drain and appropriate antimicrobial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F114630\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114630 \">image 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H821319586\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral injury is very rare. Compared with other genitourinary (GU) organs, ureteral injury tends to be more often iatrogenic. Most traumatic ureteral injuries are due to penetrating trauma, with younger men predominantly affected. Traumatic ureteral injury is highly associated with concomitant injuries. (See <a href=\"#H694822266\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A suspicion for traumatic ureteral injury is based on an appropriate mechanism of injury and clinical findings. Hematuria is present in less than one-half of patients with a ureteral injury. Clinicians should be mindful to assess for a potential ureteral injury when new symptoms of fever, flank pain, sepsis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ileus occur following initial trauma stabilization, or following pelvic surgery. (See <a href=\"#H53361667\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hemodynamically stable patients, the diagnosis of ureteral injury is typically made using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span>. Identification of ureteral injuries requires a delay of 5 to 10 minutes after the administration of intravenous (IV) contrast to allow contrast to reach the ureters. (See <a href=\"#H670602368\" class=\"local\">'CT urography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the operating room (eg, trauma patients requiring laparotomy, suspected intraoperative injury), direct inspection of the ureters is the most sensitive method to assess for ureteral injury. Intravenous dyes (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>) can be used to aid the assessment looking for dye leakage along the course of the ureter. (See <a href=\"#H2387750438\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral injuries generally require some form of treatment. Minimal blunt ureteral injuries and partial penetrating injuries may be amenable to ureteral stenting. Ureteral repair should be performed when injury is identified at the time of laparotomy, if possible. For severe injuries, ligation of the ureter with urinary drainage and delayed reconstruction may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1867481209\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-traumatic-and-iatrogenic-ureteral-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">McGeady JB, Breyer BN.
