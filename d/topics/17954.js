In addition, a variety of systemic (so-called &quot;extraglandular&quot;) manifestations may occur, including fatigue, musculoskeletal symptoms, rashes, and internal organ (eg, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and neurologic) disease. There is also increased risk of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.</p><p>SS occurs in a primary form, not associated with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and in a secondary form, often associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or systemic sclerosis.</p><p>The treatment of salivary gland enlargement, extraglandular manifestations affecting other organs and tissues, and constitutional symptoms will be reviewed here. An overview of the systemic treatment and prognosis of SS, the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of SS, and the treatment of dry eyes, dry mouth (including the use of muscarinic agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cevimeline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cevimeline</a> as secretagogues), and other nonocular sicca symptoms are described in detail separately.

Treatment of glandular lymphoproliferation and more severe extraglandular manifestations generally includes the use of glucocorticoids; antimalarials (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>); conventional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, mycophenolic acid, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>; and other potent agents, including the alkylating agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and the anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, which targets B cells.

The enlargement is usually bilateral, although it may not be symmetric. It may be relapsing and remitting or persistent. Patients who report intermittent swelling often have chronically enlarged glands that are not of cosmetic concern or noticeable to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sjogrens-syndrome-constitutional-and-non-sicca-organ-based-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Systemic treatment is generally reserved for those patients with cosmetic concerns, glandular pain, or systemic involvement that would otherwise warrant it.

In the evaluation of suspected lymphoma, it is important to collect specimens for flow cytometry (core-needle specimens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fine-needle aspirates) in addition to a core-needle biopsy for histopathologic analysis. Excisional biopsy may be required if the diagnosis remains indeterminate. An approach to treatment of lymphoma in SS is described. (See <a href=\"#H327260760\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In SS patients on chronic steroids with persistent parotid gland swelling related to fatty infiltration, management includes discontinuation of glucocorticoids in favor of other immunosuppressive therapies (if still needed) and weight-loss counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2721694687\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for musculoskeletal pain depends upon the cause of the symptoms, their severity, and the response to therapy; the spectrum of inflammatory musculoskeletal pain in SS ranges from mild arthralgias and myalgias to frank synovitis and chronic pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthralgia and arthritis</strong> &ndash; Mild joint symptoms, including mild arthritis and arthralgia with associated myalgia, but without other evidence of inflammatory synovitis, may be managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in antiinflammatory doses given daily or as needed depending upon symptom frequency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with an inadequate response to NSAIDs after a three-month trial or with moderate to severe symptoms usually require a traditional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or low-dose weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, depending upon the severity of symptoms, in doses typically used for RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sjogrens-syndrome-constitutional-and-non-sicca-organ-based-manifestations/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2514032628\" class=\"local\">'Approach to drug therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1828327342\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for organ-based disease and constitutional symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H80959970\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic rationale and evidence overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2606837497\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of specific therapeutic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We generally use the following approach:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Salivary gland enlargement</strong> &ndash; Treatment of enlarged major salivary glands varies according to the severity of localized symptoms, other systemic features, and the suspected cause. Interventions may be primarily symptomatic, sometimes with preventive use of secretagogues, but can include short courses of glucocorticoids and longer courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Persistent (&gt;12 weeks) swelling may require further evaluation to exclude malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H3816825852\" class=\"local\">'Salivary gland enlargement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Musculoskeletal pain</strong> &ndash; We manage mild joint symptoms with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in antiinflammatory doses given daily or as needed depending upon symptoms. Patients with an inadequate response to NSAIDs or with moderate to severe symptoms usually require a traditional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or low-dose weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> in doses typically used for RA. Fibromyalgia is treated in the same fashion as in patients without SS. (See <a href=\"#H2721694687\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal pain'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fatigue</strong> &ndash; In patients with fatigue that is largely related to the SS itself, we treat initially with a low-impact aerobic exercise program. In patients with fatigue refractory to exercise and other lifestyle changes, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> in a fashion similar to the approach utilized for SLE, while for patients with disabling fatigue refractory to hydroxychloroquine, we treat patients with a positive response to a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with immunosuppressive drug therapy, such as glucocorticoids, conventional DMARDs, or a biologic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, depending upon the severity and response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3686612117\" class=\"local\">'Fatigue'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cutaneous manifestations</strong> &ndash; Treatment of cutaneous manifestations of SS varies by the condition. Pruritus is largely managed symptomatically. Annual erythema is treated initially with topical steroids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, or with oral glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 5 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day);</span> for recurrent skin lesions, we use systemic therapies that have benefit in cutaneous lupus, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or low-dose weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Treatment of cutaneous vasculitis depends upon the cause and whether an associated illness is present and may include local measures, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, glucocorticoids, or nonbiologic or biologic DMARDs. (See <a href=\"#H1077713833\" class=\"local\">'Pruritus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3106595702\" class=\"local\">'Annular erythema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4262696013\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous vasculitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Raynaud phenomenon</strong> &ndash; Raynaud phenomenon is treated as it is in other rheumatic diseases. (See <a href=\"#H3891435815\" class=\"local\">'Raynaud phenomenon'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cardiopulmonary disease</strong> &ndash; The treatment of most cardiopulmonary manifestations, including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and pericarditis, is approached in the same way as in patients with other systemic rheumatic disorders, such as SLE or systemic sclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H1714918178\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Renal disease</strong> &ndash; The management of interstitial nephritis with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and glomerulonephritis (GN) are described separately. The treatment of thrombotic glomerulopathy caused by antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in SS is the same as for patients with SLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-in-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal disorders</strong> &ndash; Treatment of any of the various gastrointestinal disorders associated with SS requires a careful diagnostic evaluation and appropriate therapeutic interventions for the primary disorder (eg, gastroesophageal reflux or dysmotility) and for aspects of the SS that may be contributing to the disorder (eg, treatment with secretagogues to improve salivary flow). Associated conditions (eg, celiac disease or primary biliary cholangitis [cirrhosis]) should be identified and treated as in patients without SS. (See <a href=\"#H4046613271\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neurologic manifestations</strong> &ndash; The treatment of neurologic manifestations differs depending upon the specific involvement, which may include several forms of peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and central nervous system involvement. Symptomatic therapies for neuropathic pain should avoid the use of anticholinergic agents, when possible, in favor of alternative therapies. Disorders causing functional impairment and those due to systemic vasculopathy may require glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapies. (See <a href=\"#H1297574469\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral neuropathies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1579789696\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic neuropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3628494170\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hematologic abnormalities</strong> &ndash; The majority of patients with leukopenia do not require specific therapy, although some patients require treatments including glucocorticoids, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), growth factors, or other therapies. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is treated as in other rheumatic diseases. We evaluate monoclonal proteins according to guidelines recommended for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and monitor relevant laboratory studies on an annual basis unless specific symptoms arise suggesting the development of a hematologic malignancy. The treatment of lymphomas seen in patients with SS uses the same regimens as in patients without SS, although the management of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) in SS involves unique considerations. (See <a href=\"#H2163044728\" class=\"local\">'Monoclonal gammopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H327260760\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2187016062\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editors of UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Paul Creamer, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sjogrens-syndrome-constitutional-and-non-sicca-organ-based-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mandel L.
