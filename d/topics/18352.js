By convention, UTI is defined either as a lower tract (acute cystitis) or upper tract (acute pyelonephritis) infection. UTIs (acute cystitis and pyelonephritis) and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women will be reviewed here.</p><p>Issues related to urinary tract infections or asymptomatic bacteriuria in other populations are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Additionally, the incidence of pyelonephritis is higher than in the general population, likely as a result of physiologic changes in the urinary tract during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H249334770\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in 2 to 7 percent of pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It typically occurs during early pregnancy, with only approximately a quarter of cases identified in the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Factors that have been associated with a higher risk of bacteriuria include a history of prior urinary tract infection, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, increased parity, and low socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>Without treatment, as many as 30 to 40 percent of pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria will develop a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), including pyelonephritis, during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This risk is reduced by 70 to 80 percent if bacteriuria is eradicated (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for treatment'</a> below). Although a study from the Netherlands suggested a low rate of pyelonephritis among 208 women with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria (2.4 percent versus 0.6 percent among 4035 women without bacteriuria), this study included only low-risk women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies without diabetes mellitus or urinary tract abnormalities, and it is uncertain whether these results are generalizable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Acute cystitis occurs in approximately 1 to 2 percent of pregnant women, and the estimated incidence of acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy is 0.5 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Most cases of pyelonephritis occur during the second and third trimesters. As an example, the incidence of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy in the setting of routine prenatal screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria was examined in a prospective study of a general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. During the two year study period, 440 cases of acute pyelonephritis were identified in 32,282 pregnant women (14 per 1000 deliveries). The majority of cases occurred in the second trimester (53 percent). In addition to prior untreated bacteriuria, other clinical characteristics that have been associated with acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy include age &lt;20 years, nulliparity, smoking, late presentation to care, sickle cell trait, and pre-existing (not gestational) diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249335178\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies have described a relationship between maternal urinary tract infection, particularly asymptomatic bacteriuria, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Studies have also suggested that acute pyelonephritis has a similar association, but there are several variables that potentially confound this association, such as socioeconomic status and previous preterm delivery. </p><p>Untreated bacteriuria has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,7,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,14-19</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>], studies. As an example, in a meta-analysis of 19 studies, among women without bacteriuria, the risks of preterm birth and a low birth weight infant were one-half and two-thirds the risks among women with asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other pregnancy complications have also been associated with bacteriuria. As an example, a case control study of over 15,000 pregnant women found an increased risk of preeclampsia with either asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>No correlation has been clearly established between acute cystitis of pregnancy and increased risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, or pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], perhaps because pregnant women with symptomatic lower UTI usually receive treatment. </p><p>Pyelonephritis, however, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. In an 18-year retrospective study of over 500,000 singleton pregnancies followed at a large health care system in the United States, the rate of preterm birth, primarily between weeks 33 and 36, was higher among the 2894 women who had pyelonephritis during pregnancy (10.3 versus 7.9 percent among those who did not, OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were no differences in stillbirth or neonatal death. Other complications of pyelonephritis include anemia, sepsis, and respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Maternal morbidity and obstetric outcomes with pyelonephritis do not appear to differ by trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249334770\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organisms that cause bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTI) in pregnant women are of the same species and have similar virulence factors as in nonpregnant women. Thus, the basic mechanism of entry of bacteria into the urinary tract is likely to be the same for both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, the smooth muscle relaxation and subsequent ureteral dilatation that accompany pregnancy are thought to facilitate the ascent of bacteria from the bladder to the kidney, resulting in the greater propensity for bacteriuria to progress to pyelonephritis during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pressure on the bladder from the enlarging uterus may also increase the risk of progression to pyelonephritis. In addition, the immunosuppression of pregnancy may contribute. As an example, mucosal interleukin-6 levels and serum antibody responses to <em>Escherichia coli</em> antigens appear to be lower in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249334876\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in nonpregnant women, <em>E. coli</em> is the predominant uropathogen found in both asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection (UTI) in pregnant women. As an example, in a study of over 400 cases of pyelonephritis, <em>E. coli</em> accounted for approximately 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other organisms responsible for infection included <em>Klebsiella</em> and <em>Enterobacter</em> species (3 percent each), <em>Proteus</em> (2 percent), and gram-positive organisms, including group B Streptococcus (10 percent). Group B Streptococcus in pregnancy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in pregnant women&quot;, section on 'Urinary tract'</a>.)</p><p>As in other community-acquired infections, antimicrobial resistance is an increasing concern. Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains are increasing in number, even in uncomplicated UTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In India, ESBL-producing uropathogens is a particular problem, even in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Isolation of more than one species or the presence of <em>Lactobacillus</em> or <em>Cutibacterium</em> may indicate a specimen contaminated by vaginal or skin flora. However, repeated isolation of <em>Lactobacillus</em> with high colony counts and without other organisms in consecutive urine cultures may not represent simple contamination, although the significance of this finding in pregnancy is not known. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253489103\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria is made by finding high-level bacterial growth on urine culture in the absence of symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI). Details on the timing of screening, specimen collection, and diagnostic criteria are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249335399\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America that recommend screening all pregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria at least once in early pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rationale for screening is the same as for treatment of bacteriuria and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is performed at 12 to 16 weeks gestation (or the first prenatal visit, if that occurs later) with a urine culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Rescreening among those who did not have bacteriuria on the initial test is generally not performed in low-risk women. It is reasonable to rescreen women at high risk for infection (eg, history of UTI or presence of urinary tract anomalies, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin S, or preterm labor), however the optimal target populations for this is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249335368\"><span class=\"h3\">Specimen collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria should be based on culture of a urine specimen collected in a manner that minimizes contamination. Although the optimal method for collecting voided urine is uncertain, instructing women to spread their labia and collect a midstream urine (without requiring a clean-catch) seems most reasonable. Routine catheterization to screen for bacteriuria is not warranted due to the risk of introducing infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sampling and evaluation of voided urine in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In order to minimize contamination of the voided specimen, it is often recommended that the patient collect a clean-catch (after local cleansing of the urethral meatus and surrounding mucosa) midstream (collection of the second portion of the voided urine after discarding the initial stream) specimen. However, it is not clear that these measures reduce contamination. In a study of 113 asymptomatic pregnant women, each was instructed to collect a midstream sample from the first concentrated morning urine, a midstream sample, and a clean-catch midstream sample, in that order, over the course of a day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Rates of mixed growth and growth of skin flora on culture in midstream urine were comparable with those observed in the morning and clean-catch samples. Overall rates of contamination were high in all three samples, and the women were tested at a mean of 32 weeks of gestation as opposed to the recommended period of 16 weeks. Findings from this and other studies suggest that collection of a clean-catch voided urine specimen is of little value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. </p><p>Proper handling and processing of the specimen is crucial to avoid false-positive results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-specimen-collection-and-transport\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology specimen collection and transport&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253489185\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For asymptomatic women, bacteriuria is formally defined as two consecutive voided urine specimens with isolation of the same bacterial strain in quantitative counts of &ge;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(cfu)/mL</span> or a single catheterized urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of &ge;10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In clinical practice, however, only one voided urine specimen is typically obtained, and diagnosis (and treatment initiation) is made in women with &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> without obtaining a confirmatory repeat culture. The threshold for diagnosis (and treatment) of asymptomatic bacteriuria due to group B <em>Streptococcus </em>during pregnancy is lower, at &ge;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span>.

Antimicrobial treatment reduces the risk of subsequent development of pyelonephritis and is associated with improved pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,36-40</a>]. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials of antibiotic treatment versus placebo or no treatment for pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Antibiotic therapy was more likely to clear asymptomatic bacteriuria (odds ratio [OR] 0.30, 95% CI 0.18-0.53) and to lower the incidence of pyelonephritis (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13-0.41). There was also a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight infants with antibiotic treatment. However, the included studies that evaluated these outcomes were deemed to be of poor quality. </p><p>Similar effects of treatment were suggested by a subsequent prospective study of pregnant women in the Netherlands (where screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is not performed routinely) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria between 16 and 22 weeks gestation who were not treated or received placebo treatment had a higher rate of pyelonephritis (2.4 percent of 208 women) compared with both those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria (0 percent of 40 women) and those who did not have asymptomatic bacteriuria (0.6 percent of 4035 women). Likewise, low birth weight occurred in 17 of 208 untreated or placebo-treated women with asymptomatic bacteriuria (8 percent) compared with 1 of 40 of nitrofurantoin-treated women (2.5 percent). While this difference was not statistically significant, the study was under-powered for this outcome. Preterm birth did not differ between these two groups. Notably, the study included only women who were at low risk for UTI, pre-term birth, or other complications, and the pyelonephritis rate was lower than in previous studies of pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Antimicrobial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is treated with an antibiotic tailored to the susceptibility pattern of the isolated organism, which is generally available at the time of diagnosis.

The choice of antimicrobial agent should also take into account safety during pregnancy (including the particular stage of pregnancy). (See <a href=\"#H249335517\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic safety in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal duration of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteruria is uncertain. Short courses of antibiotics are preferred to minimize the antimicrobial exposure to the fetus. Short course antibiotic therapy is usually effective in eradicating asymptomatic bacteriuria of pregnancy, although single-dose regimens may not be as effective as slightly longer regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. As an example, in a meta-analysis of 13 studies comparing single-dose treatment with four to seven day treatments, there was a trend towards lower rates of bacteriuria clearance with the single-dose regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>An exception is single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a>, which successfully treats bacteriuria.

The presence of fever and chills, flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness should raise suspicion for pyelonephritis (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Acute pyelonephritis'</a> below). A urinalysis and urine culture should be performed in pregnant women who have new onset dysuria. Specimen collection is the same as for asymptomatic bacteriuria. (See <a href=\"#H249335368\" class=\"local\">'Specimen collection'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of acute cystitis is confirmed by finding of bacterial growth on urine culture. Prior to confirming the diagnosis, empiric treatment is typically initiated in a patient with consistent symptoms and pyuria on urinalysis (see <a href=\"#H775757841\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below). As in nonpregnant women, pyuria is usually present in almost all pregnant women with symptomatic urinary tract infection, and its absence strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis.

It has been estimated that as many as 20 percent of women with severe pyelonephritis develop complications that include septic shock syndrome or its variants, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. As an example, in a prospective study of 440 cases of acute pyelonephritis identified among 32,282 pregnant women in a general obstetric population, complications included anemia (23 percent), bacteremia (17 percent in the minority of patients who were tested), respiratory insufficiency (7 percent), and renal dysfunction (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Although many pregnant women have back or flank pain without pyelonephritis, we have a low threshold for evaluation for bacteriuria and a diagnosis of pyelonephritis in pregnant women with these symptoms, given the risk of complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes with untreated pyelonephritis.

Although there is no evidence that bacteremia portends a worse prognosis or requires longer therapy in an otherwise healthy pregnant woman with pyelonephritis, it is reasonable to obtain blood cultures in those with signs of sepsis or serious underlying medical conditions such as diabetes. Other tests, such as a serum lactate level, can also be useful in women with suspected sepsis to inform the severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>Imaging is not routinely used to diagnose pyelonephritis. However, in patients with pyelonephritis who are severely ill or who also have symptoms of renal colic or history of renal stones, diabetes, history of prior urologic surgery, immunosuppression, repeated episodes of pyelonephritis, or urosepsis, imaging of the kidneys can be helpful to evaluate for complications.

If induction of labor or cesarean delivery for standard obstetrical indications is planned in a patient on treatment for pyelonephritis, we favor waiting until the patient is afebrile, as long as delaying the delivery is relatively safe for the mother and fetus.</p><p>Since pyelonephritis is associated with preterm birth, an important obstetric consideration is whether tocolysis should be used when pyelonephritis triggers preterm labor at various gestational ages. Tocolysis is typically not administered after 34 weeks gestation. If a woman with uncomplicated pyelonephritis prior to that gestational age experiences preterm labor, administration of tocolysis and steroids is reasonable to attempt to prolong the pregnancy. However, if the patient is septic, tocolysis is generally avoided. Pregnant women with pyelonephritis are at increased risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be exacerbated by administration of tocolysis with or without corticosteroids. Detailed discussion of the benefits and risks of tocolysis for acute preterm labor are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhibition of acute preterm labor&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent pyelonephritis during pregnancy occurs in 6 to 8 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/65,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,71,72</a>]. As a result, low dose antimicrobial suppressive therapy with an agent to which the original organism is susceptible is warranted for the remainder of the pregnancy; reasonable options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> (50 to 100 mg orally at bedtime) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> (250 to 500 mg orally at bedtime) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/62,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,73</a>]. </p><p>Monthly cultures are not necessary if preventive therapy is administered; however, breakthrough bacteriuria can occur during preventive therapy, so we usually perform at least one later culture, such as at the start of the third trimester, to ensure preventive therapy is working. If a follow-up culture is positive (&ge;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> then a course of antimicrobial therapy based on susceptibility data should be administered. In addition, the preventive regimen should be reassessed and adjusted if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249336320\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION IN WOMEN WITH HISTORY OF RECURRENT UTI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A separate issue is the management of pregnant women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) prior to pregnancy, which is often related to sexual intercourse. We use postcoital prophylaxis in pregnant women who have recurrent UTIs that appear to be temporally related to sexual intercourse. The preferred regimen is a single postcoital dose of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> (250 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> (50 mg). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent urinary tract infection in women&quot;, section on 'Prevention strategies'</a>.)</p><p>The potential efficacy of postcoital prophylaxis to prevent UTIs during pregnancy was evaluated in a report of 33 women with a history of recurrent UTIs who had 39 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The women were treated with a single postcoital dose of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> (250 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> (50 mg). Only one UTI occurred during pregnancy; this was in sharp contrast to 130 UTIs during a mean observation period of seven months before prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249335517\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBIOTIC SAFETY IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the information regarding the safe use of antibiotics during pregnancy was obtained decades ago, before pregnant women were excluded from drug studies because of concerns about risk to the fetus. Thus, there is little direct information about the safety of many newer antibiotics in pregnancy, and concern about the use of certain antibiotics generally derives from indirect evidence (eg, animal studies) or observational studies that may have numerous confounders. Overall, the safest course is to use the antibiotics that have well-established safety profiles in pregnancy and limit the use of antibiotics of potential concern to cases in which no safer alternative exists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs#H1294336483\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Patient education, health promotion, and safety of commonly used drugs&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p>It is generally accepted that penicillins (with or without beta-lactamase inhibitors), cephalosporins, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a> are safe in pregnancy. However, drugs with very high protein binding, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, may be inappropriate the day before parturition because of the possibility of bilirubin displacement and subsequent kernicterus. Of the carbapenems, some animal studies have shown adverse fetal effects with imipenem-cilastatin, so <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a> are the preferred carbapenems for use during pregnancy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosfomycin</a> is also generally considered safe in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In several studies of single-dose fosfomycin during pregnancy, it was well-tolerated, and adverse fetal effects were not observed.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrofurantoin</a> is frequently used during pregnancy, although some potential concerns exist. Nitrofurantoin has been associated with birth defects in case control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>], but these findings should be interpreted with caution as multiple comparisons involving small numbers of affected exposed infants may have led by chance to the observed associations. In a prospective study of pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, there were no congenital birth abnormalities reported among the 40 women who received nitrofurantoin compared with 2 among the 208 women who received placebo or no antimicrobial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The safest course is to avoid using nitrofurantoin in the first trimester if another antibiotic that is safe and effective is available. Nitrofurantoin has also been reported to cause hemolytic anemia in the mother and fetus with G-6PD deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The risk of hemolytic anemia is estimated to be only 0.0004 percent of cases, but its use should be avoided near term for this reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/73,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,79</a>]. </p><p>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> is typically limited to mid-pregnancy, avoiding the first trimester and near term. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim</a> is generally avoided in the first trimester because it is a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> antagonist, has caused abnormal embryo development in experimental animals, and some case control studies have reported a possible association with a variety of birth defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. However, it is not a proven teratogen in humans. Women are routinely prescribed folic acid supplementation during pregnancy; this may be particularly important in those who are taking trimethoprim. Sulfonamides should be avoided in the last days before delivery because they can displace bilirubin from plasma binding sites in the newborn, with the theoretical increased risk for kernicterus, although kernicterus related solely to in utero sulfonamide exposure has never been reported. Sulfonamides have also been associated with birth defects in a case control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], but the limitations of the study discussed above lead to uncertainty about the association. </p><p>Aminoglycosides have been associated with ototoxicity following prolonged fetal exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], and therefore should be avoided unless intolerance or resistance prohibits the use of less toxic agents.</p><p>Tetracyclines should not be used, and fluoroquinolones are generally not used during pregnancy.

Without treatment, as many as 30 to 40 percent of pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria will develop a symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). The smooth muscle relaxation and subsequent ureteral dilatation that occurs in pregnancy are thought to facilitate the ascent of bacteria from the bladder to the kidney, accounting for the greater risk of pyelonephritis. Additionally, untreated bacteriuria may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality. (See <a href=\"#H249334047\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H249334770\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in nonpregnant women, <em>Escherichia coli</em> is the predominant uropathogen found in both asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in pregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H249334876\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We screen all pregnant women at least once for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is performed at 12 to 16 weeks gestation with a midstream urine for culture. The diagnosis is made by finding high-level bacterial growth (&ge;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">[cfu]/mL</span> or, for group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, &ge;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL)</span> on urine culture in the absence of symptoms consistent with UTI.

Potential options include beta-lactams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98083 \">table 1</a>). Following treatment, follow-up cultures are performed to confirm sterilization of the urine. For those women with persistent bacteriuria, prophylactic or suppressive antibiotics may be warranted in addition to retreatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cystitis should be suspected in pregnant women who complain about new onset dysuria, frequency, or urgency. The diagnosis is made by finding of bacterial growth on urine culture in this setting. Management of acute cystitis in pregnant women includes empiric antibiotic therapy that is subsequently tailored to culture results. Potential options for empiric and directed therapy include beta-lactams, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F98083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98083 \">table 1</a>). As with asymptomatic bacteriuria, follow-up cultures are performed to confirm sterilization of the urine. For those women with persistent bacteriuria or recurrent cystitis, prophylactic or suppressive antibiotics may be warranted in addition to retreatment. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Acute cystitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy is suggested by the presence of flank pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> fever (&gt;38&ordm;C), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> costovertebral angle tenderness, with or without the typical symptoms of cystitis, and is confirmed by the finding of bacteriuria in the setting of these symptoms.

Antibiotic therapy can be converted to an oral regimen tailored to the susceptibility profile of the isolated organism following clinical improvement.
