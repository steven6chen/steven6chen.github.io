Patients with eyelid abnormalities commonly present to their primary care physician. Primary care clinicians, therefore, must be able to identify serious conditions that require urgent referral and to provide appropriate therapy for treatable benign conditions.</p><p>This topic will discuss the differential diagnosis of non-acute lesions that affect the eyelid. Eyelid lacerations, blepharitis, and the differential diagnosis of the red eye are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eyelid-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eyelid lacerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENIGN NODULAR LESIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Xanthelasma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xanthelasma are cholesterol-filled, soft, yellow plaques that usually appear on the medial aspects of the eyelids bilaterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67919 \">picture 1</a>). They most often occur in middle-aged and older adults.</p><p>Hyperlipidemia is present in approximately 50 percent of patients with xanthelasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These lesions are a classic feature of primary biliary cholangitis, a condition often associated with marked hypercholesterolemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypercholesterolemia-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypercholesterolemia in primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>). They are also common in patients with primary disorders of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol metabolism; they occur in 75 percent of older patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and 10 percent of patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of LDL-cholesterol metabolism other than familial hypercholesterolemia&quot;</a>). Young individuals, in particular, with xanthelasma, appear to have a relatively high prevalence of lipoprotein abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In normolipidemic individuals, the possible association between xanthelasma and atherosclerosis is not clear. Some studies have noted other lipoprotein abnormalities in normocholesterolemic patients with xanthelasma that may increase the risk of coronary heart disease, including low levels of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Thus, it is reasonable to obtain a lipid profile in patients with xanthelasma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xanthelasma are always benign lesions. Therapy is usually undertaken only for cosmetic reasons.</p><p>Lipid lowering may induce regression of xanthelasma in some patients, although the effect is not consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Removal can be attempted with surgery, carbon dioxide laser, or topical 100 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a> (TCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], but recurrence is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chalazion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chalazion, meaning &quot;hail stone&quot; in Greek, is a chronic inflammatory lesion that develops when a Zeis or meibomian tear gland of the eyelid becomes obstructed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80892 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62030 \">picture 3</a>). A chalazion may first present with eyelid swelling and erythema and then evolve into a painless, rubbery, nodular lesion. It is seen commonly in patients with eyelid margin blepharitis and in those with rosacea. An inflamed hordeolum will often calm and scar into a hard chalazion. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hordeolum'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are not indicated since chalazion is a granulomatous condition. Small chalazia often resolve without intervention. For larger lesions, frequent hot compresses may allow them to drain although typically most clear spontaneously in weeks to months. Symptomatic patients with recalcitrant lesions can be referred to an ophthalmologist for incision and curettage or direct glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Persistent or recurring chalazia should be checked histopathologically for possible sebaceous cell, basal cell, or meibomian gland carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hordeolum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hordeolum is an acute purulent inflammation of the eyelid. It may be sterile or may show both inflammatory cells and bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus. An internal hordeolum represents inflammation of a meibomian gland just under the conjunctival side of the eyelid. An external hordeolum (stye) arises from an eyelash follicle or a lid-margin tear gland (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58059 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hordeolum is largely based on case reports, as randomized trial data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Both internal and external hordeola can be treated with warm compresses, placed off and on for about 15 minutes at a time approximately four times per day.</p><p>If, despite continued treatment with warm compresses, the hordeolum hardens into a chalazion and does not reduce in size within one to two weeks, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration of incision and curettage.</p><p>If there is concurrent preseptal cellulitis, oral antibiotics with Staphylococcal coverage are appropriate. However, cellulitis is uncommon, and it may be difficult to distinguish secondary cellulitis from sterile inflammation.</p><p>Patients are frequently treated with topical medications containing antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corticosteroids. There is little evidence that these are helpful in promoting healing. Patients who have frequent hordeola in the setting of rosacea-associated blepharitis, and who have not found relief with warm compresses and mechanical removal of lid margin debris, may benefit from a topical <span class=\"nowrap\">antibiotic/corticosteroid</span> ointment combination (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a>). This, however, is best managed under the care of an ophthalmologist because of the ocular complications caused by long-term steroid use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Molluscum contagiosum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and spread by direct contact or by fomites. It is usually seen as one or multiple small, pale, shiny nodules with central umbilication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68192 \">picture 5</a>). A chronic conjunctivitis may accompany the condition if it is located on the lid margin. The diagnosis is based on clinical appearance; biopsy is rarely necessary.</p><p>Most patients with molluscum contagiosum are not immunodeficient, although approximately 10 to 20 percent of HIV-infected patients develop this infection on the face, neck, or anogenital areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There may be more dissemination with confluent lesions in patients with immune deficiency states; these individuals can have up to 40 lesions on each eyelid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molluscum may resolve spontaneously within one year. Treatment options include simple excision, cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and desiccation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MALIGNANT NODULAR LESIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1034072473\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All primary carcinomas of the eyelid (excluding melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) can be staged according to the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This system is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110634 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the eyelid, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all such malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. It usually arises in fair-skinned individuals with a history of prolonged sun exposure. It may be associated with basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin-Gortz Syndrome) or xeroderma pigmentosum, particularly in younger patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Basal cell carcinomas are commonly small, slow-growing, firm, painless, pearly, and indurated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67350\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67350 \">picture 6</a>). There may be associated telangiectasia. Sometimes there is a loss of lashes associated with the lesions. Morpheaform tumors are less common but more aggressive; these nodules are firm, raised, plaquelike, and often show ulceration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of basal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One-half to two-thirds of basal cell carcinomas involve the lower eyelid margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In order of declining frequency, lesions are also found in the medial canthus, upper eyelid, and lateral canthus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>These tumors are locally invasive, but only rarely metastasize. However, neglected tumors can grow to large size and invade as deeply as bone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An evidence-based review supported two therapies for basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid: Mohs' chemosurgery and excision with frozen-section control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Two large series that evaluated these techniques in patients with basal cell carcinoma reported recurrence rates of 1 and 2 percent, respectively, although follow-up in the latter study was only three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Cryosurgical techniques are also being developed that are effective at a lower cost, and better preserve the surrounding structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Radiation therapy usually is reserved for recurrent or extensive tumors, and for patients not amenable to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Squamous cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma is much less common but faster growing than basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma can arise de novo or from preexisting actinic keratosis and is more likely to metastasize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The tumor usually is found on the lower eyelid, with a propensity for the lid margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. Similar to basal cell carcinoma, prolonged sun exposure is a risk factor for this malignancy. Squamous cell carcinomas present as nodules or plaques with everted edges that enlarge and often develop crusting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69166\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69166 \">picture 7</a>). Unlike basal cell carcinomas, they do not show surface telangiectasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by incisional biopsy. Wide local surgical excision with frozen section is usually sufficient for cure. Orbital exenteration may be necessary in cases of deep invasion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a>). As with basal cell carcinoma, the two treatments best supported by the evidence-based review cited above include Mohs' chemosurgery and excision with frozen section control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The reported recurrence rate with the former method is approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Primary radiation therapy has also been described as an effective alternative to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Sebaceous carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sebaceous carcinoma is often mistaken for recurrent chalazion or blepharoconjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is a highly malignant carcinoma arising from meibomian, Zeis, or sebaceous glands of the skin. Five-year mortality rates as high as 30 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] although more recent studies suggest that earlier definitive treatment improves prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and have found much lower mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/24,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sebaceous-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sebaceous carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sebaceous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the upper lids of females over age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. A nodule that originally resembles a chalazion and then causes loss of lashes as well as destruction of the meibomian gland orifices is likely to be a sebaceous carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77552\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77552 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wide surgical excision is the main treatment modality for sebaceous carcinoma. Disappointing results have been reported with radiation and Mohs' surgery although no prospective studies have been performed. Excision with frozen section control appears to be the most tissue-sparing procedure with the highest cure rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Radiation is reserved generally for larger tumors, as an adjunct to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Orbital exenteration may be necessary for large tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Keratoacanthoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing hyperkeratotic nodule with a central keratin plug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59550\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59550 \">picture 9</a>). The growth of a keratoacanthoma occurs over three to six weeks, in contrast to the slow growth of typical squamous cell carcinomas over months to years. Keratoacanthomas may occur on either sun-damaged or protected skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keratoacanthoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keratoacanthoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is controversy regarding whether keratoacanthomas are malignant or benign; although they resemble squamous cell carcinomas histologically, most will spontaneously regress with scar formation. On the other hand, there have been reported cases of invasive keratoacanthoma, some with metastases, leading many authors to consider it a form of squamous cell carcinoma and treat it as such. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keratoacanthoma-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keratoacanthoma: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">WART-LIKE LESIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Squamous papilloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common benign tumor of the eyelid is squamous papilloma, a lesion caused by the human papillomavirus. It presents as a frond-like (skin tag) or lobular projection of skin that contains a central vascular core (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76858 \">picture 10</a>). Simple excision or cryotherapy is curative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Seborrheic keratosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seborrheic keratoses appear as greasy, brownish, crust-like lesions &quot;stuck on&quot; to the eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67714\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67714 \">picture 11</a>). They commonly are seen in the elderly. Enlargement occurs outwardly; shave biopsy is usually sufficient for this benign condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Actinic keratosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratosis is a premalignant condition. It predisposes to squamous cell carcinoma in 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Lesions are usually dry, scaly, and flat with an erythematous base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71298\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71298 \">picture 12</a>). Biopsy, followed by surgical excision or cryotherapy, is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous horn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cutaneous horn usually presents as a dark protrusion of packed keratin from the surface of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65697 \">picture 13</a>). It typically overlies an area of malignancy (basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma). Biopsy of the horn and underlying skin is performed for diagnosis of the underlying condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">CYSTIC LESIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Milia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Milia are pinpoint, multiple, firm, white lesions that usually occur on both the upper and lower eyelids. They are caused by the plugging of hair follicles (pilosebaceous units) by keratin. Therapy consists of puncture of the lesions with a pin and expression of the contents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidermal inclusion cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An epidermal inclusion cyst is a solitary, slow growing, mobile, firm, round, subcutaneous nodule most commonly found on the upper eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79621\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79621 \">picture 14</a>). It typically forms after trauma or surgery, or may be congenital. Cysts can become infected or rupture, causing an inflammatory reaction. Surgical excision with the complete wall of the cyst is recommended to prevent recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoid cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoid cysts are usually recognized in infancy, and often grow during puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. They are firm, mobile, subcutaneous cysts found most commonly in the lateral brow or upper eyelid regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72727\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72727 \">picture 15</a>). Attachment to the frontozygomatic skull suture often is present and sometimes can extend far back into the orbit.

The superficial spreading melanoma lesion is usually smaller with elevation. Both of these forms typically have a long phase of superficial growth before invasion into deeper tissues. Nodular melanoma is more aggressive and may present as a pigmented or amelanotic nodule that grows rapidly and begins to bleed.</p><p>Excessive sun exposure, genetic factors, Caucasian race, and changing skin nevi are the biggest risk factors for this disease.

It is associated with the Sturge-Weber syndrome. This lesion is congenital and usually covers the eye and nearby facial skin, typically in the distribution of a branch of the trigeminal nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58831\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58831 \">picture 17</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73978\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73978 \">picture 18</a>). It does not blanch with pressure. It may be associated with ocular and leptomeningeal vascular hamartomas as well as glaucoma and retinal detachment. Argon laser therapy has been somewhat successful at removing these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

This benign tumor usually is present at birth or manifests by six months of age. It consists of a bright red papule, nodule, or plaque raised above clinically normal skin. Superficial hemangiomas are believed to be hamartomatous proliferations of vascular endothelial cells. Approximately seventy percent will spontaneously regress by the age of seven years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-hemangiomas-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile hemangiomas: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of the propensity of the tumor to shrink on its own, treatment is usually limited to large tumors and those that may cause the lid to occlude the pupil. Continued occlusion could lead to amblyopia and subsequent strabismus. Treatments include intralesional steroid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], radiotherapy, laser therapy, surgery, and rarely systemic steroids.

Some spontaneously resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/eyelid-lesions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Cryotherapy, intralesional chemotherapy, surgical excision, and irradiations have been used with varied success with this condition.

The primary care clinician should be able to distinguish potentially malignant lesions, and arrange appropriate referral. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign nodular lesions include xanthelasma, chalazion, hordeolum, and molluscum contagiosum. Xanthelasma, yellow cholesterol-filled plaques, are associated with hyperlipidemia in 50 percent of affected patients. Chalazia, hard granulomata may require hot compress application, glucocorticoid injection, or incision and curettage. A hordeolum is an acute purulent inflammation, usually responsive to warm compresses. Molluscum contagiosum, characterized by shiny nodules with central umbilication, may resolve spontaneously within one year. Patients with benign lesions unresponsive to usual treatment should be referred to ophthalmology for confirmation of diagnosis and further treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Benign nodular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common malignant eyelid tumor is a basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas occur as nodules or plaques, usually on the lower lid. Treatment for either condition is by Mohs' chemosurgery or excision. Sebaceous carcinoma may initially resemble a chalazion on the upper eyelid but, in a progressed state, may cause loss of lashes; wide excision is indicated. Keratoacanthomas grow over three to six weeks; while some may spontaneously regress, they are best treated similarly to squamous cell carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Malignant nodular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wart-like lesions include the benign conditions, squamous papilloma and seborrheic keratoses. Actinic keratosis is premalignant and requires excision or cryotherapy. Cutaneous horns may develop overlying a basal cell or squamous cell cancer. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Wart-like lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of malignant transformation of benign pigmented eyelid nevi is about 5 percent. Malignant melanoma are infrequent (1 percent of all eyelid malignancies) but have significant mortality. Treatment is by wide excision, with regional lymph node dissection if extension is suspected.
