Unlike cicatricial alopecias (eg, lichen planopilaris or discoid lupus), the inflammatory process in alopecia areata does not lead to scarring and destruction of the hair follicle.

In alopecia areata, peribulbar inflammation is associated with dystrophic changes in anagen follicles and stimulates premature transition of anagen follicles to the nonproliferative catagen and telogen phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Theories for the mechanism of autoimmunity have included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collapse of the immune-privileged status of hair follicles leads to a cell-mediated immune response that targets follicular antigens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune privilege does not extend to the catagen phase, and inflammatory cells that normally present during follicular regression inappropriately trigger an immune response against follicular antigens.</p><p/><p>The results of a genome-wide association study suggest that genes involved in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems participate in the pathogenesis of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the study, genomic regions containing the CTLA4, <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-2/IL-21,</span> IL-2RA, and Eos genes, all of which are involved in regulating the activation or proliferation of regulatory T cells, were identified as susceptibility loci for alopecia areata. A strong association also was detected in a region containing genes encoding ULBPs, molecules involved in the stimulation of natural killer, natural killer T, gamma delta T, and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. </p><p>A key role for cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup>NKG2D<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata is supported by a study performed with a mouse model of alopecia areata that found that transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup>NKG2D<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice with alopecia areata induced alopecia areata in healthy mice, whereas transfer of lymph node cell populations from diseased mice that were depleted of NKG2D<sup>+</sup> cells did not transfer the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is proposed that interferon produced by CD8<sup>+</sup>NKG2D<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulates the collapse of immune privilege in the hair follicle. Janus kinase (JAK) signalling pathways that support interferon production by CD8<sup>+</sup>NKG2D<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and IL-15 production by follicular epithelial cells appear to play an important role in the perpetuation of this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In support of this theory, marked improvement in alopecia areata has been reported during treatment with JAK inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-alopecia-areata#H92728618\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of alopecia areata&quot;, section on 'Janus kinase inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to these findings, the genome-wide association study confirmed previously reported associations of alopecia areata with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. The HLA-DQB1*03 allele, among others, may be an important marker for susceptibility to the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Several susceptibility loci that have been associated with other autoimmune diseases (eg, CTLA4, <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-2/IL-21,</span> IL-2RA) also were identified, indicating that alopecia areata may share a common pathway with other autoimmune diseases. </p><p>Although a cell-mediated immune response is thought to be primarily responsible for hair loss in alopecia areata, hair follicle autoantibodies are frequently present in sera from affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Whether these antibodies have a pathogenic role is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H988007641\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic background</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic background influences risk for the development of alopecia areata. In a study of 206 patients with alopecia areata, 20 percent had a first degree relative with the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The importance of genetics is also supported by studies reporting high concordance rates among identical twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In one study involving 19 sets of monozygotic twins, both twins were affected in 42 percent of twin sets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In contrast, among 31 pairs of dizygotic twins, only 10 percent shared the disease. The genetic predisposition for alopecia areata is polygenic in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors, such as infections, drugs, and vaccinations, have been implicated in triggering episodes of alopecia areata. Some patients report severe stress, especially emotional stress, as a precipitating event, although many patients have no such history. Remote events, such as childhood trauma, have also been associated with the development of alopecia areata in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>A potential role for vitamin D has been proposed based upon a study that found significantly lower serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with alopecia areata compared with healthy controls and an inverse correlation between serum vitamin D levels and alopecia areata severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Occasionally, pruritus or a burning sensation may precede the loss of hair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71583%7EDERM%2F105455%7EDERM%2F79908%7EDERM%2F58252%7EDERM%2F87348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71583 graphicRef105455 graphicRef79908 graphicRef58252 graphicRef87348 \">picture 1A-E</a>). A rare diffuse variant of alopecia areata that is characterized by generalized thinning of scalp hair also exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Alopecia most commonly occurs on the scalp but may be found on any hair-bearing area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53104%7EDERM%2F66057%7EDERM%2F72738\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53104 graphicRef66057 graphicRef72738 \">picture 2A-C</a>). Short hairs broken off a few millimeters from the skin surface (also known as exclamation point hairs) may be found at the edges of expanding patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65864 \">picture 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). In men, involvement of the beard may be the initial or only manifestation. In a retrospective study of 55 men with new-onset alopecia areata limited to the beard and a mean follow-up period of 29 months (range 12 to 144 months), 46 percent developed scalp involvement, usually within 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Patches of alopecia can enlarge and coalesce into bizarre patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70996%7EDERM%2F63538%7EDERM%2F76247\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70996 graphicRef63538 graphicRef76247 \">picture 4A-C</a>). A band-like area of alopecia extending across the occipital scalp (ophiasis pattern) may occur in some patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52784\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52784 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The rare sisaipho pattern of alopecia areata, also known as ophiasis inversus, presents with alopecia involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal scalp but spares hair along the scalp periphery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110290\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110290 \">picture 6</a>). This distribution resembles the pattern of hair loss seen in androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>White hairs initially may be spared, leading to the appearance of rapid graying of the hair in adult patients with multiple new lesions. In some patients, regrowth may begin with the appearance of fine white vellus hairs.</p><p>Persistent areas of alopecia and patches exhibiting regrowth of hair may occur simultaneously on the same patient. In a minority of cases, the disease may progress to complete loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or all scalp and body hair (alopecia universalis).

Nail disease may precede, follow, or coexist with active hair loss. Pitting of the nail plate is most common; however, a variety of other disorders, including trachyonychia (roughening of the nail plate), onychorrhexis (longitudinal fissuring of the nail plate), red spotting on the lunulae, onycholysis (separation of the distal nail plate from the nail bed), and onychomadesis (detachment of the proximal nail plate from the nail bed) may also accompany alopecia areata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73527%7EDERM%2F64919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73527 graphicRef64919 \">picture 7A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Nail involvement has been associated with greater severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alopecia areata is associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders and other diseases. One of the largest disease association studies, a nationwide study from Taiwan that included 4334 patients with alopecia areata, found associations with vitiligo (odds ratio [OR] 5.23, 95% CI 3.06-9.00), lupus erythematosus (OR 3.95, 95% CI 3.05-5.11), psoriasis (OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.24-3.50), atopic dermatitis (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.95-2.58), thyroid disease (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.68-2.13), and allergic rhinitis (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18-1.41) among all patients compared with control subjects and differences in disease associations based upon the age of onset of alopecia areata. Another large study supports an association between alopecia areata and atopic dermatitis. In a case-control study of 2055 patients with alopecia areata and 588 non-alopecic controls, a history of atopic disease was more common in the alopecia group (31 percent) than in controls (21 percent) and was associated with an increased risk of developing alopecia areata (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.50-2.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>An increased risk for type I diabetes mellitus has been reported in relatives of individuals with alopecia areata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, there does not appear to be an increased risk for diabetes among those with the disease.</p><p>Genetic disorders associated with an increased risk for alopecia areata include Down's syndrome (trisomy 21, MIM #190685) and polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I (MIM #240300) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. The latter is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results from a mutation in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene on chromosome 21. In a study of 1000 institutionalized patients with Down syndrome, the prevalence of alopecia areata was approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. One series of 19 patients with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I reported the presence of alopecia areata in 33 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, alopecia areata may persist for several years and in some cases hair growth never recovers. Approximately 10 percent of patients progress to alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50229\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50229 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The following factors have been associated with increased risk for a poor prognosis or high likelihood of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset in childhood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe disease, especially alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of more than one year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Band-like involvement of the peripheral temporal and occipital scalp (ophiasis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of alopecia areata</p><p/><p>Long-term outcomes were assessed in a study of 191 patients with alopecia areata who presented to a university dermatology clinic in Italy between 1983 and 1990 and who were contacted by phone in 2005 to give self-reports of their clinical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Patients with less severe disease at presentation were more likely to report being free of disease at follow-up (68 percent with less than 25 percent hair loss initially; 32 percent with 25 to 50 percent hair loss initially; 8 percent with more than 50 percent hair loss initially).

In acute cases, the presence of peribulbar lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates surrounding anagen follicles is characteristic. These infiltrates are often described as resembling swarms of bees. In addition, signs of follicular insult may be seen, such as follicular edema, cellular necrosis, microvesiculation, and pigment incontinence.</p><p>The peribulbar inflammatory infiltrate is thought to stimulate the transition of anagen follicles to the catagen and telogen stages. Thus, biopsy specimens from subacute lesions reveal high proportions of follicles in the late stages. Follicular miniaturization characterizes the chronic stage of the disease. The presence of an inflammatory infiltrate in chronic lesions is variable.</p><p>It is best to perform two 4 mm punch biopsies into the subcutaneous fat. One specimen should be processed with routine vertical sectioning and the other with horizontal sectioning.

Among 298 children (ages 10 months to 19 years) with alopecia areata who had thyroid function studies performed, 59 (20 percent) had abnormal results. Factors associated with increased risk for abnormalities included a personal history of Down syndrome or atopy and a family history of thyroid disease. Age, disease duration, pattern of alopecia, and a diagnosis of autoimmune disease were not associated with abnormal thyroid studies. </p><p>Pending additional data to support reduced screening for thyroid disease in children with alopecia areata, we continue to screen all affected children for thyroid disease.</p><p>In addition, adults and children with clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of other autoimmune diseases should be evaluated for those disorders.

Inflammation and cervical lymphadenopathy may also be present. Tinea capitis should always be considered in children presenting with patchy hair loss. In contrast, alopecia areata produces smooth areas of hair loss that lack scale.

All are characterized by permanent destruction of hair follicles. Hair loss is usually patchy and there is loss of follicular orifices. Additional features are variable and, depending on the primary pathology, may include erythema, scaling, follicular plugging, and pustulation. Early lesions of cicatricial alopecia, particularly in discoid lupus erythematosus, may resemble alopecia areata. This is important to recognize as hair growth may be salvaged by prompt treatment.

The disorder can affect individuals of any age, but for many patients, symptoms begin before the age of 30. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of alopecia areata is thought to involve autoimmune-mediated disruption of the normal hair cycle, leading to the inhibition of normal hair growth. Genetic predisposition also contributes to the development of the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with alopecia areata typically present with smooth, circular, discrete areas of complete hair loss that develop over a period of a few weeks. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail findings may accompany hair loss in alopecia areata; pits in the nail plate are the most common manifestation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alopecia areata has been associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases and other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Associated diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The course of alopecia areata is unpredictable. Approximately 50 percent of patients with limited patchy hair loss experience regrowth within one year, but recurrence is common. A minority of patients may progress to total loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or loss of all body hair (alopecia universalis). Poor prognostic factors for alopecia areata include young age of onset, severe disease, long duration of disease, ophiasis pattern, nail disease, and an atopic history. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Course of disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of alopecia is often made via clinical examination. Biopsies can be performed in cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Strazzulla LC, Wang EHC, Avila L, et al.
