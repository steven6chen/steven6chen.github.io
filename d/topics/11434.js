Among those who have LVH, two-thirds die from HF or sudden death, while one-third die from a noncardiovascular event.

However, additional, larger randomized trials are necessary before we recommend the addition of an aldosterone antagonist; the small size of these studies, slow recruitment, and absence of placebo in one study limit confidence in the results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Correction of anemia with erythropoietic-stimulating agents -</strong> Partial correction of anemia with erythropoietin decreases LVH, presumably by improving tissue oxygen delivery. This allows cardiac output (which is increased in anemia) and, therefore, cardiac work to fall toward normal.

As an example, one prospective study of 24 dialysis patients evaluated changes in LV mass by echocardiography at 3, 6, and 12 months posttransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was a significant decrease in blood pressure at 12 months, and the incidence of LVH decreased from 75 to 52 percent. There was also a significant decrease in LV dilatation, and systolic dysfunction normalized in all patients after 12 months. It is unclear if removing the uremic milieu, improving blood pressure, or both were significant factors underlying these changes. Arterial stiffness also significantly improves after renal transplantation and may in part be responsible for the regression of LV mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FAILURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure (HF) is more common among ESRD patients compared with the general population. In an analysis of data from United States Renal Data System (USRDS), the HF hospitalization rate (with HF as a primary reason for hospitalization) in 2011 for hemodialysis patients was 140 per 1000 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, the annual incidence of new HF hospitalizations in white males in the United States 65 to 74 years of age without ESRD is 15.2 per 1000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Either systolic or diastolic dysfunction can lead to clinically evident HF, even when the patient is at or near &quot;dry weight&quot; (ie, euvolemic). Myocardial disease can also reduce cardiac reserve, making the patient more vulnerable to episodes of hypotension during dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1410078956\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinicopathologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among dialysis patients, the clinicopathologic features of HF without coronary artery disease are incompletely described. Imaging studies have suggested that diffuse myocardial fibrosis is common among ESRD patients, even in the presence of a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32-34</a>]. Myocardial metabolism is frequently altered and associated with less efficient use of high-energy phosphates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32-34</a>].</p><p>Extensive fibrosis has been shown on biopsy. As an example, in one study, endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 40 ESRD patients with dilated cardiomyopathy without coronary artery disease and in a control group of 50 nondialysis patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Severe myocyte hypertrophy and extensive fibrosis were characteristic of the dialysis group. Patients not on dialysis had a similar proportion of fibrosis but overall a much smaller proportion of severely hypertrophic myocytes (8 versus 45 percent in dialysis patients). In the dialysis patients, increasing fibrosis correlated with a decreased survival rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occult ischemic heart disease may contribute to cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In an experimental uremia rat model, after a myocardial infarction as small as 8 percent of LV mass, there is substantial loss of LV function and an increased fibrotic response over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Hemodialysis-induced myocardial stunning is common and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Hemodialysis-induced myocardial stunning is defined as hemodialysis-induced segmental LV dysfunction in the absence of known heart disease. In a study of 70 patients, significant myocardial stunning during hemodialysis was noted at baseline in 64 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At 12 months follow-up, survival was significantly lower in those with stunning. Among those who survived, the LVEF was markedly lower at rest and during hemodialysis. A second study demonstrated a lower prevalence of hemodialysis-induced LV dysfunction of 27 percent, but still an increased mortality associated with this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The difference in prevalence of stunning between studies may have been due to differences in the study population (including a lower percentage of patients with diabetes, known cardiovascular disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LV hypertrophy [LVH] in the latter study) or to differences in the echocardiographic method of evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1410078009\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for new-onset HF in ESRD patients are in part similar to the general population and include hypertension, older age, anemia, ischemic heart disease, and baseline systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The prevalence of atheromatous disease in ESRD is high, and this may in part be due the clustering of risk factors and the direct result of renal dysfunction.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is primarily released from atrial myocardial cells in response to volume expansion and possibly increased wall stress. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a natriuretic hormone that is similar to ANP, was initially identified in the brain but is also present in the heart, particularly the ventricles.

Major risk factors for LVH include hypertension (particularly systolic blood pressure) and increasing age. Chronic volume overload, anemia, and possibly increased cardiac index may contribute. LVH is typically diagnosed by echocardiography. LVH may be reversed by rigorous control of blood pressure and anemia and by kidney transplantation.
