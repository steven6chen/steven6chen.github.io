The frequency of serious complications depends upon the valve type and position, and other clinical risk factors. Complications include embolic events, bleeding, valve obstruction (due to thrombosis or pannus), infective endocarditis, structural deterioration (particularly for bioprosthetic valves), paravalvular regurgitation, hemolytic anemia, and patient-prosthesis mismatch.</p><p>Thromboembolic- and anticoagulation-related problems are by far the most frequent complications of mechanical valves. The long-term risk of thromboembolism is generally lower with bioprosthetic valves, though there is an increased risk of thromboembolism for bioprosthetic as well as mechanical valves early after valve implantation. </p><p>The anticoagulants used to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolic events in patients with prosthetic heart valves are vitamin K antagonists (VKA; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>; generally for long-term therapy) and heparin (mainly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin; generally for short-term bridging therapy), with indications as described below. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> is recommended as an antiplatelet agent in addition to anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valve prosthesis and is suggested in patients with bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valves.

However, rapid reversal of anticoagulation, leading to subtherapeutic INRs, increases the risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism. Given these concerns, we suggest an individualized approach based largely on expert opinion that is generally consistent with the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> and 2012 European Society of Cardiology guideline recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H742473636\"><span class=\"h2\">Overanticoagulation without bleeding</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are not bleeding and have an INR &ge;6, VKA should be temporarily discontinued to permit a gradual reduction in INR; small doses (1 or 2.5 mg) of <strong>oral</strong> vitamin K may be administered to help hasten the fall in INR in patients with a high risk of bleeding.

PCC containing approximately equal concentrations of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X (known as four-factor PCC), when available, are preferred over three-factor PCC or FFP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94210 \">table 1</a>). A four-factor PCC has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for urgent reversal of VKA in patients with acute major bleeding. Three-factor PCCs contain low concentrations of factor VII and thus may require coadministration of FFP to lower an elevated INR effectively.

A repeated dose of PCC has not been studied in this setting and will increase the risk of thrombosis. Thus, repeated doses of PCC should be given only in the setting of life-threatening bleeding when the coagulopathy is due to continued VKA effect; in such cases, PCC doses should be given at least six hours apart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The approach described above is generally consistent with the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> valve guideline, which states that administration of FFP or PCC is reasonable in patients with mechanical valves and uncontrollable bleeding who require reversal of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <br/><br/>Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is <strong>not</strong> recommended for VKA reversal in individuals with prosthetic heart valves because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern for risk of thrombosis, especially in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Components may include advance planning of perioperative anticoagulant management (including anticoagulant discontinuation and resumption and bridging therapy, as applicable), providing patients and providers with a calendar outlining the timing of anticoagulant changes and INR testing, providing education on injection technique for any outpatient low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy, and assessment of postoperative hemostasis. </p><p>When discontinuation of anticoagulation is required, general guidelines for the duration of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) discontinuation are provided below. However, individual responses to discontinuation of anticoagulation vary widely, so careful monitoring, including International Normalized Ration (INR) testing on the day before and the day of the procedure, is required.

If the INR is 1.5 to 1.9 on the day before surgery, administration of a low dose of oral vitamin K (eg, 1 to 2.5 mg) is likely to reduce the INR to 1.4 or less on the day of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, in patients with mechanical valves who require interruption of VKA therapy, high-dose vitamin K should <strong>not</strong> be routinely administered before invasive procedures since this will significantly delay the ability to re-anticoagulate with VKA after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The decision on whether or not to use bridging with heparin during the period that the INR is subtherapeutic is based upon the risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism as discussed below.

As an example, given the low bleeding risk of eye surgery, particularly for cataract removal or glaucoma, it can generally be performed without change in anticoagulant therapy. In preparation for procedures during which VKA will be continued, it is important to confirm that the INR is in the therapeutic range prior to the procedure (exact timing of testing is individualized).

In 16 operations on patients with only an aortic prosthesis, oral anticoagulation was discontinued for three to five days without IV UFH coverage. In 26 operations on patients with mechanical mitral prostheses, the patients were treated with IV UFH during the period when oral anticoagulation was discontinued; IV UFH was interrupted only for 12 hours at the time of surgery. There were no thromboembolic events in either group. </p><p>In an open-label, randomized multicenter trial (including some patients with prosthetic valves), a four-factor PCC was shown to be superior to FFP in rapid INR reduction and hemostasis in patients on VKA with an INR &gt;2 needing an urgent surgical or invasive intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-management-of-bleeding-and-invasive-procedures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The trial enrolled 181 patients on VKA therapy who required rapid reversal of anticoagulation before an urgent invasive or surgical procedure. All patients received Vitamin K with randomization to a single dose of four-factor PCC compared with FFP based on INR and patient weight. Effective hemostasis was achieved in only 75 percent of patients in the FFP group compared with 90 percent in the PCC group (difference 14.3 percent, 95% CI 2.8-25.8). The safety profile was similar for both treatment arms with thromboembolism in 7 percent of PCC-treated patients versus 8 percent of FFP-treated patients. The relevance of this study to patients on VKA therapy for a mechanical heart valve is unclear; the reasons for VKA therapy in this study were arrhythmia in 42 percent, vascular disease in 21 percent, a previous thromboembolic event in 17 percent, and a prosthetic heart valve (type not specified) or joint in only 16 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
