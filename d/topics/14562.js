Certain syndromes are classically or most commonly associated with <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, specifically. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecthyma gangrenosum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burn wound infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Folliculitis associated with hot tub exposures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection following nail puncture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Green nail syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perichondritis following ear piercing or acupuncture</p><p/><p>These are discussed in further detail below. </p><p>Additionally, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can be involved in other general skin and soft tissue infections, such as cellulitis (particularly in neutropenic patients), postoperative infections, infections following trauma (particularly after injury in aquatic environments), and infections of chronic decubitus ulcers. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> osteomyelitis can result from direct invasion or hematogenous spread, especially in injection drug users. Inflammatory subcutaneous nodules (ie, panniculitis) due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in the absence of bacteremia or classic immunosuppression have been rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Skull base osteomyelitis associated with malignant otitis externa is most commonly caused by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-necrotizing-external-otitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant (necrotizing) external otitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with other infections, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> soft tissue infections are often associated with worse outcomes than other pathogens. As an example, in a prospective study of 132 patients who received skin grafts for soft-tissue defects, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> was the most common etiologic microorganism in skin-graft loss due to infection (58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infections due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> were more fulminant and were 4.2 times more likely to require reoperation that those caused by other organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210515359\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, treatment of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> skin, soft tissue, and bone infections should include aggressive surgical debridement of any necrotic tissue and infected eschars, in addition to antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic options include an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, a carbapenem, and a fluoroquinolone. In general, aminoglycosides should not be used as a single agent for infection at these sites. Specific agents and doses are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of antimicrobial therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics with antipseudomonal activity'</a>.)</p><p>The usual duration of antimicrobial therapy for skin and soft tissue infection is 10 to 14 days; however, shorter courses may be acceptable if the clinical signs and symptoms of infection have resolved. Occasional patients will continue to have local signs of infection at the end of two weeks of treatment. We generally continue oral antibiotic therapy (if the isolate is susceptible) in these patients until resolution of all erythema has occurred.</p><p>The usual duration of antimicrobial therapy for osteomyelitis is six weeks following surgical debridement. If the isolate is fluoroquinolone susceptible, therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (750 mg twice daily) can be used.</p><p>Specifics on the management of ecthyma gangrenosum, burn infections, folliculitis, infections following nail puncture, and green nail syndrome are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1133434152\"><span class=\"h1\">ECTHYMA GANGRENOSUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> has been classically associated with a characteristic skin lesion called ecthyma gangrenosum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80582 \">picture 1</a>), which is most frequently described in the setting of bacteremia in immunocompromised patients. It results from perivascular bacterial invasion of the media and adventitia of arteries and veins with secondary ischemic necrosis. Ecthyma refers to an ulcerative lesion that extends through the epidermis and deep into the dermis and appears as a &quot;punched-out&quot; ulcer covered in crust surrounded by raised violaceous margins. Although ecthyma gangrenosum is not pathognomonic of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection, the presence of these lesions should immediately raise the high probability that <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is the causative organism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20689149\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ecthyma gangrenosum is classically associated with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> sepsis and bacteremia in immunocompromised patients, including those with neutropenia and those on immune modulating agents. It has been observed in approximately 1.3 to 3 percent of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>&nbsp;bacteremia cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In some cases, ecthyma has been described in patients who were subsequently discovered to have an immune deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, it has also been reported in healthy, immunocompetent patients without bacteremia or systemic infection. In such patients, ecthyma gangrenosum can present as localized skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Lesions may occur after breakdown of mechanical defense barriers and local infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Diabetes and malnutrition have been identified as predisposing factors in patients without classic immunocompromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210515389\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ecthyma gangrenosum results from perivascular bacterial invasion of the media and adventitia of arteries and veins with secondary ischemic necrosis. </p><p><em>Pseudomonas</em> produces several toxins that mediate the process of tissue degradation. Exotoxin A inhibits protein synthesis and elastase degrades elastin, thereby destroying the blood vessel wall support. Phospholipase C breaks down phospholipids in cell membranes and pyocyanin produces reactive oxygen species toxic to cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210514982\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80582 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114332 \">picture 2</a>) commonly begin as painless red macules which rapidly evolve into areas of induration that develop into pustules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bullae. Ultimately, these become gangrenous ulcers. Ecthyma lesions typically progress rapidly (within 12 to 18 hours). The lesions may involve the skin or mucous membranes. </p><p>Although ecthyma gangrenosum can occur at any anatomic location, the anogenital and axillary areas are most commonly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The gluteal and perineal areas are involved in 57 percent of cases, extremities in 30 percent, the trunk in 6 percent, and the face in 6 percent. Periorbital lesions are very rare but have been described. </p><p>Lesions may be single or multiple; in the latter case, they may be in different stages of development at any given point in time.</p><p>Biopsy of ecthyma gangrenosum lesions typically shows hemorrhagic necrosis, gram-negative bacilli, and damage to the media of arterial blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Most patients have fever and may be systemically ill; however, ecthyma gangrenosum can occur in patients in the absence of fever or other constitutional signs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210515007\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ecthyma gangrenosum is not pathognomonic of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection. Identical lesions have been seen with systemic infection due to an array of common and uncommon bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among bacterial pathogens, <em>Pseudomonas stutzeri</em>, <em>Aeromonas</em> spp, <em>Stenotrophomonas</em> spp, <em>Citrobacter</em> spp, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and atypical mycobacteria have been described to cause ecthyma gangrenosum. Among fungal infections, <em>Fusarium</em> spp have been classically associated with ecthyma gangrenosum, and a few reports have described ecthyma gangrenosum-like lesions in immunocompromised patients with disseminated candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>In light of the broad microbial differential diagnosis, efforts to identify the causative pathogen in every patient are warranted. These are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1210515013\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Pyoderma gangrenosum may rarely be confused with ecthyma gangrenosum when it is evolving from a pustule or vesicle into a typical cutaneous ulcer. However, the lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum are not due to an infection, they are usually tender, and patients are typically not systemically sick. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210515013\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum is generally made based on the characteristic clinical appearance of the lesions in the appropriate clinical setting. The presence of these lesions should immediately raise the possibility of bacteremia, particularly with <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, and should thus prompt the collection of blood cultures if not already performed. However, the absence of growth on blood cultures does not rule out the diagnosis of ecthyma. </p><p>A specific microbial diagnosis is important given that many different organisms can cause ecthyma gangrenosum, which is another reason for collecting blood cultures. Culture of exudates from an aspirate or swab of lesions is easy to perform and may identify a causative pathogen. If both blood cultures and cultures from skin exudates are negative, a biopsy of the lesion for pathology and bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures may be useful to exclude other etiologies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210515395\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the typical involvement of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, empiric antimicrobial therapy of a lesion suspicious for ecthyma gangrenosum should include an agent with antipseudomonal activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91115 \">table 1</a>). In certain high-risk patients (eg, neutropenic or otherwise immunocompromised) and those with severe infections (eg, sepsis or septic shock), we favor the use of a combination antimicrobial regimen for initial empiric therapy. The rationale for the use of combination therapy is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-antimicrobial-therapy-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections#H6675708\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of antimicrobial therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections&quot;, section on 'Rationale'</a>.)</p><p>Once the causative organism and its susceptibility pattern are identified, directed therapy with a single active agent can be tailored to these results. Specific antimicrobial options for <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infections are discussed elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91115 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Although not generally warranted for infections with limited involvement, surgical debridement and even skin grafting may be necessary in patients with severe or extensive skin necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BURN INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> skin infection complicating burn injuries is a severe infection often associated with antibiotic resistance that warrants combination empiric therapy. These infections often have a poor outcome despite the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>P. aeruginosa</em> is one of the most commonly isolated organisms from burn patients, accounting for 57 percent of positive swab and tissue culture results in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Rates of bacteremia due to <em>P. aeruginosa</em> vary by center. In one study of 5882 burn patients admitted to a burn center over a 25 year period, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia occurred in 9 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The mortality rates in patients with and without bacteremia were 77 and 49 percent, respectively. In another study, bacteremia occurred in 7 percent of 1415 burn patients; 15 percent of these bacteremic patients were infected with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (1 percent overall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Among children, factors associated with an increased risk of infection with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> include flame and inhalation burns, full thickness burns, and total body surface area involvement greater than 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A retrospective analysis of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> bacteremia in children found that 7 percent of cases occurred in burn patients; mortality among burn patients was greater than oncology patients and other patients (40 versus 19 and 11 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with extensive burns are considered to be immunosuppressed on the basis of altered neutrophil activity, T lymphocyte dysfunction, and imbalance in the production of cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Colonization of the burn eschar site with <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (up to 10<sup>5</sup> of bacteria per gram of tissue) is common. Burns destroy the physical barrier to tissue invasion; this in turn allows bacteria on the surface of the skin to invade into the dermis and enter the lymphatics along fibrous septae. After such invasion, organisms can proliferate in necrotic tissue and invade blood vessels, producing a secondary bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the skin in patients with burn injuries complicated by <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection typically reveals discoloration of the burn eschar, bleeding in the subcutaneous tissue, and degeneration of the granulation tissue. Healthy adjacent tissue may rapidly develop edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis, with new nodular lesions and eschars forming by centrifugal spread. Systemic signs and symptoms identical to those seen with other systemic bacterial infections are usually present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection in burn patients can be made through growth of the organism on quantitative cultures from a biopsy obtained from the burn skin as well as adjacent unburned tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A colony count of 10<sup>5</sup> organisms per gram of tissue in the setting of consistent clinical findings is indicative of a burn wound infection, as opposed to simple colonization. The distinction between the varying levels of bacterial involvement in burn wound infections is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Consideration of this organism is important because it causes severe hospital-acquired infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts, is often antibiotic resistant, complicating the choice of therapy, and is associated with a high mortality rate. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain clinical syndromes are classically or most commonly associated with <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. These include ecthyma gangrenosum, burn wound infections, eruptions associated with hot tub exposures, infection following nail puncture, and green nail syndrome. Additionally, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can be involved in other more typical skin and soft tissue infections, especially those in immunocompromised patients or following instrumentation or water exposure. (See <a href=\"#H1210513851\" class=\"local\">'Clinical syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, treatment of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> skin, soft tissue, and bone infections should include aggressive surgical debridement of any necrotic tissue and infected eschars, in addition to antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic options include an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, a carbapenem, and a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91115 \">table 1</a>). Aminoglycosides should not be used as a single agent for infection at these sites.

Ultimately, these become gangrenous ulcers. Ecthyma lesions typically progress rapidly (within 12 to 18 hours).

Since ecthyma gangrenosum can be occasionally caused by organisms other than <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, confirmation of the microbial etiology is important. Cultures of blood and lesion exudates may be informative. Otherwise, skin biopsy may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H1210515007\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1210515013\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the typical involvement of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, empiric antimicrobial therapy of a lesion suspicious for ecthyma gangrenosum should include an agent with antipseudomonal activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91115 \">table 1</a>).
