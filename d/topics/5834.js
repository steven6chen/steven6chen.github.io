Edema can occur nearly anywhere in the body. Some of the most common sites are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower legs or hands (also called peripheral edema)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdomen (also called ascites)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest (called pulmonary edema if in the lungs, and pleural effusion if in the space surrounding the lungs)</p><p/><p>Ascites and peripheral edema can be uncomfortable and can be a sign of a more serious condition. Pulmonary edema, which makes it difficult to breathe and can be life threatening, is a symptom of heart failure and is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EDEMA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of edema depend upon the cause but may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or puffiness of the skin, causing it to appear stretched and shiny. This typically is worse in the areas of the body that are closest to the ground (because of gravity). Therefore, edema is generally the worst in the lower legs (called peripheral edema) after walking about, standing, sitting in a chair for a period of time, or at the end of the day. It accumulates in the lower back (called sacral edema) after being in bed for a long period. Pushing on the swollen area for a few seconds will leave a dimple in the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased size of the abdomen (with ascites).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty breathing (with edema in the chest).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EDEMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different problems can cause edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic venous disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common cause of edema in the lower legs is chronic venous disease, a condition in which the veins in the legs cannot pump enough blood back up to the heart because the valves in the veins are damaged. This can lead to fluid collecting in the lower legs, thinning of the skin, and, in some cases, development of skin sores (ulcers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79766 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-venous-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic venous disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Edema can also develop as a result of a blood clot in the deep veins of the lower leg (called deep vein thrombosis [DVT]). In this case, the edema is mostly limited to the feet or ankles and usually affects only one side (the left or right); other conditions that cause edema usually cause swelling of both legs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women retain extra fluid. Swelling commonly develops in the hands, feet, and face, especially near the end of a normal pregnancy. Swelling without other symptoms and findings is common and is not usually a sign that a complication, such as preeclampsia (sometimes called toxemia), has developed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Monthly menstrual periods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Edema in women that occurs in a cyclic pattern (usually once per month) can be the result of hormonal changes related to the menstrual cycle. This type of edema is common but does not require treatment, because it resolves on its own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Edema can be a side effect of a variety of medications, including some oral diabetes medications, high blood pressure medications, non-prescription pain relievers (such as ibuprofen), and estrogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The edema of kidney disease can cause swelling in the lower legs and around the eyes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, is due to a weakened heart, which impairs its pumping action. Heart failure can cause swelling in the legs and abdomen, as well as other symptoms. Heart failure can also cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs (pulmonary edema), causing shortness of breath. This can be a very dangerous condition requiring emergency treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver from various causes, which can obstruct blood flow through the liver. People with cirrhosis can develop pronounced swelling in the abdomen (ascites) or in the lower legs (peripheral edema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cirrhosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sitting for prolonged periods, such as during air travel, can cause swelling in the lower legs. This is common and is not usually a sign of a problem. The table provides tips to minimize leg swelling during travel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71028\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71028 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If your leg(s) remain swollen or you develop leg pain hours or days after the flight, contact your healthcare provider. Continued swelling and pain can be signs of a blood clot (DVT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194942112\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions to some medications and some inherited disorders can cause fluid to leak out of the blood vessels into surrounding tissues (angioedema). This can cause rapid swelling in the face, lips, tongue, mouth, throat, voice box, limbs, or genitals. Symptoms may include hoarse voice, throat tightness, and difficulty swallowing.&nbsp;Swelling of the throat can interfere with breathing and may be life threatening.</p><p>Sometimes, this type of swelling occurs in the bowel (the intestinal wall) and can result in abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194942118\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical removal of lymph nodes for the treatment of cancer (most commonly breast cancer) can cause swelling of a limb or limbs with thickening of the skin on the side of the surgery. Swelling of both legs because of lymph problems can also be an inherited condition that becomes apparent in childhood or young adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSING THE CAUSE OF EDEMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you develop new swelling in one or both of your legs, hands, in your abdomen, or around your eyes, you should call your healthcare provider to determine if you need to be evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you develop a sudden onset of swelling in the lips, tongue, or mouth, especially if it affects your ability to talk or breathe, you should go to an emergency department immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EDEMA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of edema includes several components: treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), reducing the amount of salt (sodium) in your diet, and, in many cases, use of a medication called a diuretic to eliminate excess fluid. Using compression stockings and elevating the legs may also be recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-treatment-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the treatment of edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not all types of edema require treatment. Edema related to pregnancy or menstrual cycles is not usually treated. Peripheral edema and ascites are usually treated slowly to minimize the side effects of rapid fluid loss (such as low blood pressure).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce salt (sodium) in your diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sodium, which is found in table salt and processed foods, can worsen edema. Reducing the amount of salt you consume can help to reduce edema, especially if you also take a diuretic. Guidelines on how to reduce sodium are available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretics are a type of medication that causes the kidneys to excrete more water and sodium, which can reduce edema. Diuretics must be used with care because removing too much fluid too quickly can lower the blood pressure, cause lightheadedness or fainting, and impair kidney function.</p><p>You may have to empty your bladder more frequently after taking a diuretic. However, other side effects are uncommon when diuretics are taken at the recommended dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Compression stockings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leg edema can be prevented and treated with the use of compression stockings. Stockings are available in several heights, including knee-high, thigh-high, and pantyhose. Knee-high stockings are sufficient for most patients. Some stockings can cause skin irritation or pain, although proper measurement and fitting of the stockings can reduce the risk of discomfort. More detailed compression stocking tips are available in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57705\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57705 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52484%7EPI%2F53659%7EPI%2F80635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52484 graphicRef53659 graphicRef80635 \">figure 3A-C</a>).</p><p>Effective compression stockings apply the greatest amount of pressure at the ankle and gradually decrease the pressure up the leg. These stockings are available with varying degrees of compression.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stockings with small amounts of compression can be purchased at pharmacies and surgical supply stores without a prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with moderate to severe edema, those on their feet a lot, and those with ulcers usually require prescription stockings. A healthcare provider may take measurements for stockings or may write a prescription for stockings and then have a surgical supply or specialty store take the necessary measurements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The white &quot;antiembolism&quot; stockings commonly given in the hospital do not apply enough pressure at the ankle and are not adequate treatment for edema.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Body positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leg, ankle, and foot edema can be improved by elevating the legs above heart level for 30 minutes three or four times per day. Elevating the legs may be sufficient to reduce or eliminate edema for people with mild venous disease, but more severe cases require other measures. In addition, it may not be practical for those who work to elevate their legs several times per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4413\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
