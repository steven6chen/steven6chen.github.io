The classic description of CBD is that of a progressive asymmetric movement disorder characterized by various combinations of akinesia, rigidity, dystonia, focal myoclonus, ideomotor apraxia, and alien-limb phenomena. However, a wider range of clinical presentations is increasingly apparent, including onset with cognitive or behavioral abnormalities.</p><p>This topic will review clinical aspects of CBD. Other atypical parkinsonian disorders are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7743066\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL ASPECTS AND NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first description of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) in 1967 reported the disorder in three patients who had an asymmetric, akinetic-rigid neurodegenerative syndrome with cerebral cortical dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The original name given to this was &quot;corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia,&quot; based upon its neuropathologic appearance. It would be another two decades before the next series of six patients was described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, as subsequent cases were evaluated, it became apparent that the dentate pathology was infrequent and the nomenclature evolved to the more accurate terminology of corticobasal or corticobasal ganglionic degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>It is now recognized that pathologically proven CBD often begins as a cognitive or behavioral disturbance. Additionally, the cognitive and motor features considered characteristic of CBD are not specific to CBD, but may occur with other pathologically proven neurodegenerative disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8</a>]. This has prompted some experts to the use the term &quot;corticobasal syndrome&quot; (CBS) for cases with a clinical diagnosis, while reserving &quot;corticobasal degeneration&quot; for cases with neuropathologic confirmation.</p><p>A fundamental abnormality of the cytoskeletal protein tau is the underlying pathologic substrate, which has led to CBD being labeled as a tauopathy. Other tauopathies include Alzheimer disease, Pick disease (frontotemporal dementia), and progressive supranuclear palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The shared tau protein pathology may explain the overlap of clinical symptoms and the complex neuropathology present in these diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7743073\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated annual incidence of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) ranges from 0.62 to 0.92 per 100,000 population, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 5 to 7 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the precise incidence and prevalence of CBD are unknown. Several factors, including the lack of validated and widely accepted diagnostic criteria, and the increasingly recognized clinical and neuropathologic heterogeneity of the disease, have prevented the completion of large epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].</p><p>The disease typically presents in the sixth to eighth decades of life with onset of symptoms occurring at a mean age of 61 to 64 years in different reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>]. The youngest case with pathologic confirmation had the onset of symptoms at age 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], while the youngest case of clinically probable CBD had onset of symptoms at age 28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Some authors report an unequal gender distribution suggesting a predominance in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16-18</a>], but other reports have found no gender preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The disease is considered to occur sporadically, although rare familial cases of CBD have been reported, leading to the possibility that there may be a genetic basis for at least a predisposition to the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is no evidence to suggest that environmental exposure to toxic or infectious agents plays a role in the pathophysiology of CBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7743080\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic description of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is that of a progressive asymmetric movement disorder with symptoms initially affecting one limb, including various combinations of akinesia and extreme rigidity, dystonia, focal myoclonus, ideomotor apraxia, and alien limb phenomena (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55825 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/2,13,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,16,19</a>]. However, most of the early reports describing the clinical features of CBD were retrospective case series from movement disorder centers that may have led to a referral bias in emphasizing the motor symptoms.</p><p>It is now recognized that the clinical features of CBD are heterogeneous, including varied motor pictures. This clinical heterogeneity has led to the use of the term &quot;corticobasal syndrome&quot; (CBS) for cases with a clinical diagnosis and &quot;CBD&quot; for cases with neuropathologic confirmation. In some cases the symptoms can be symmetric instead of the classic asymmetric presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, it has been found that cognitive impairment is a common manifestation of CBD and may be a presenting feature, while the parkinsonian motor features may emerge later as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/14,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21-23</a>]. Important cognitive features of CBD include executive dysfunction, aphasia, apraxia, behavioral change, and visuospatial dysfunction, with relatively preserved episodic memory. The heterogeneity is likely a reflection of the topographical variations in pathological lesions in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of retrospective data from 210 cases of pathologically confirmed CBD, a final clinical diagnosis was available for 183 cases (87 percent), and multiple clinical phenotypes were associated with pathologically confirmed cases of CBD as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticobasal syndrome (CBS), 37 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, 23 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontotemporal dementia, 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alzheimer-like dementia, 8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aphasia, typically categorized as primary progressive aphasia or progressive nonfluent aphasia, 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed diagnoses involving the above phenotypes, 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parkinson disease, 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dementia with Lewy bodies, 1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other, 1 percent</p><p/><p>All of these phenotypes are also associated with non-CBD pathologies, causing diagnostic challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H100657484\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The following studies illustrate the range of findings reported for CBD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 18 patients with an autopsy diagnosis of CBD, the dominant clinical syndromes at presentation were a combination of dysexecutive and motor features in 7, progressive nonfluent aphasia in 5, and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia in 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 14 autopsy-proven cases of CBD, the most common features at disease onset were an asymmetric clumsiness of a limb, with or without rigidity in 7 patients; a gait disorder in 5; sensory problems in 4; tremor, cognitive problems, and behavioral changes in 3 patients each; and speech disorder in 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The mean time to first visit to a neurologist was three years, and the most prevalent symptoms at that time were an asymmetric limb bradykinesia or rigidity (8 patients) and ideomotor apraxia (7 patients). Despite these features, only 5 of the 14 patients were diagnosed during life with CBD, highlighting the difficulty in making the correct antemortem diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a later series of 15 pathologically proven cases of CBD, the presenting complaints were exclusively cognitive for 8 patients, both cognitive and motor for 4 patients, and exclusively motor for 3 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The cognitive problems primarily involved impairments of speech, language, visuospatial, social, and executive function. The most frequent motor complaints at presentation were related to gait difficulty, while the most frequent motor signs were unilateral limb rigidity or axial rigidity. With disease progression, extrapyramidal problems emerged or worsened in the majority of patients, and executive dysfunction developed in all patients prior to death. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172630660\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor and gait involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a systematic review that evaluated retrospective data from patients with pathologically confirmed CBD, the most common motor features (with frequency at presentation and during the entire course of disease) were the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb rigidity (57 and 85 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradykinesia or clumsy limb (48 and 76 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postural instability (41 and 78 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls (36 and 75 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal gait (33 and 73 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperreflexia (30 and 50 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial rigidity (27 and 69 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremor (20 and 39 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb dystonia (20 and 38 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myoclonus (15 and 27 percent)</p><p/><p>In many cases, motor symptoms begin in one limb. Rigidity can be profound with and without cogwheeling. Dystonia involves abnormal posturing of the hand (opened or closed) or foot (toe curling and foot inversion) that quickly becomes fixed. Along with apraxia (see <a href=\"#H168534479\" class=\"local\">'Cortical dysfunction'</a> below), the affected limb is rendered useless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. While axial rigidity, typical of progressive supranuclear palsy, is sometimes seen, the limb rigidity is notably more severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27</a>]. Symptoms ultimately progress to involve all four limbs.</p><p>The gait in CBD is variable but can be bradykinetic, short stepped, and shuffling, similar to the gait of typical Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There is typically no arm swing in the affected upper limb, which is often flexed and held against the body. A wide based &quot;frontal lobe&quot; or freezing gait can also occur in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. One study found that freezing of gait occurred in 1 of 13 patients with CBD within three years, and in 3 of 12 patients within six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Rarely, CBD can present with gait freezing as primary progressive freezing gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Postural instability is considered a later feature. However one study suggested that gait difficulty and a propensity to fall can be the earliest motor feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Occasionally, some patients can develop leg apraxia, making it impossible to walk. Tremor is seen less frequently than in idiopathic Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and is more of a rapid (6 to 8 hertz) <span class=\"nowrap\">postural/action</span> tremor, often described as irregular and jerky [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] but is sometimes mistaken for the classic resting tremor of Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>]. Myoclonus is sometimes present, and can often be elicited by sensory or motor stimulation or action of the affected limb, such as by tapping the limb or testing deep tendon reflexes. The myoclonus is probably related to an enhanced, long-loop reflex with a pathway that is different from classic cortical reflex myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172641960\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech alterations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a systematic review of patients with pathologically confirmed CBD, speech changes were noted at presentation in 23 percent of patients, and during the entire course of disease in 53 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some earlier reports suggested that speech is affected in 90 percent or more of patients with CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,33</a>]. Dysarthria is prominent and usually an early feature. Characteristics are mixed and varied. About one-third of patients have the hypokinetic form, similar to the type seen in idiopathic Parkinson disease, that is characterized by reduced volume, monotone pitch, fluctuating speech articulation, shallow inhalations, and a slow rate of speech punctuated with rapid-burst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other less common forms include mixed dysarthrias with varied features of spasticity and pseudobulbar speech, strained strangulated voice with prolongation of sounds similar to spasmodic dysphonia, and hypernasality. Apraxia of speech, a disorder of speech articulation, is characterized by effortful, halting speech and inconsistent speech sound distortions and errors. It can be a presenting symptom of CBD and overlaps with the <span class=\"nowrap\">nonfluent/agrammatic</span> variant of primary progressive aphasia (also called progressive nonfluent aphasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H85747391\" class=\"local\">'Aphasia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172641856\"><span class=\"h2\">Oculomotor dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a systematic review, abnormal eye movements were noted at presentation in 33 percent of patients with CBD, and during the entire course of disease in 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pursuit eye movements in CBD are slow and saccadic with the appearance of several steps to reach a target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Vertical saccades are usually normal or only mildly affected in CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] as compared with progressive supranuclear palsy, where initial slowing of vertical saccades is followed by a limitation of saccadic range and eventually ophthalmoplegia. Initiation of saccades may be impaired, although spontaneous saccades remain normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This represents a form of ocular apraxia. However, supranuclear gaze palsy in a significant minority of CBD cases can mimic the oculomotor findings of progressive supranuclear palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168534479\"><span class=\"h2\">Cortical dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cortical dysfunction is characteristic of CBD, hence the name of the condition. In a systematic review of patients with pathologically confirmed CBD, the most common higher cortical features (with frequency at presentation and during the entire course of disease) were the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment (52 and 70 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral changes (46 and 55 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb apraxia (45 and 81 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aphasia (40 and 52 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression (26 and 51 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical sensory loss (25 and 27 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alien limb (22 and 30 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20808635\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive decline is a prominent feature of CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/12,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,40,41</a>]. As an example, in a series of 13 autopsy proven cases of CBD, dementia was the most common presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Only 4 out of the 13 cases had an antemortem diagnosis of CBD, while 6 others were clinically diagnosed (incorrectly) as having Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Neuropsychological testing of patients with suspected CBD shows patterns distinctly different from those of patients diagnosed with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In one study comparing 21 subjects who had CBD with 21 patients who had AD, those with CBD scored better in areas of verbal memory but showed more depression on the Geriatric Depression Scale, whereas patients with AD did better on tests of praxis and motor skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Both groups performed poorly on tests of attentional skills, as shown in the performance of speed of processing information and mental control. Another report found that learning disabilities could be overcome with verbal cueing in patients with CBD but not in those with AD, owing to the relatively preserved retention abilities in the former [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In a study comparing the cognitive features of patients with a clinical diagnosis of CBD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), ideomotor apraxia was significantly more frequent in those with CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Executive function, though abnormal in both, was more severely impaired in those with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, another study found that patients with CBD had a dysexecutive syndrome similar to that seen in PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20808642\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral and neuropsychiatric manifestations of CBD may include depression, compulsive behavior, agitation, irritability, social withdrawal, and apathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20808476\"><span class=\"h3\">Apraxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apraxia is a frequent manifestation of cortical dysfunction and is defined as difficulty performing learned and purposeful skilled movements despite having the desire to do so; it is not explained by deficits in comprehension or elemental motor or sensory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Various types of apraxia are observed in CBD, including ideomotor apraxia (inability to perform goal-directed movements) and ideational apraxia (inability to coordinate activities that require multiple sequential movements). With ideomotor apraxia, the most frequent type in CBD, unilateral damage to the dominant hemisphere and supplemental motor area can produce bilateral symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Ideational apraxias tend to occur in more advanced stages of CBD and in Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Apraxia may occur any time in the course of illness, including before the emergence of dystonia and myoclonus. In such cases, the apraxia alone may render the hand useless. Apraxia may also present after the onset of other motor symptoms and may then be difficult to detect because rigidity, dystonia, and myoclonus can themselves prevent the proper performance of skilled movements. The usual complaint of the patient is that the limb will not do what they want it to do. Apraxia is usually associated with cortical sensory loss such as agraphesthesia and astereognosis. Patients may complain of numbness and tingling, and examination may also demonstrate impaired two-point discrimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/10,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85747391\"><span class=\"h3\">Aphasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Language problems associated with CBD range from mild phonologic impairments to severe and progressive nonfluent aphasia, a type of aphasia often complicated by the coexistence of speech apraxia (see <a href=\"#H172641960\" class=\"local\">'Speech alterations'</a> above) that is sometimes observed in other tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/14,21,34,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,34,51-53</a>]. In patients with CBD, aphasia is usually noted earlier in those with cognitive-onset CBD compared with those who have motor-onset CBD. However, aphasia typically develops with disease progression in patients with motor-onset CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

It can affect the arm or leg and is described as a feeling that the limb does not belong to the subject or that it has a will of its own.

From the initial description of neuropathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], CBD was considered mainly as a distinct neurodegenerative disorder characterized by asymmetric frontoparietal atrophy with extensive neuronal loss, gliosis, and ballooned achromatic (ie, without staining) neurons. The descriptive pathologic terms &quot;ballooned neurons&quot; and &quot;neuronal achromasia&quot; eventually became synonymous with the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Today, a broader range of pathology has been established, and the overlap of many features with other neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal dementia (including Pick disease), Alzheimer disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is increasingly recognized to be related to a shared tau-related cytoskeletal pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,12,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,62</a>].</p><p>Typical autopsy findings in CBD on gross examination include an asymmetric frontoparietal cortical atrophy that is oftentimes localized to the perirolandic region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,12,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,63</a>]. A study comparing neuropathology between cases of CBD (n = 9) and PSP (n = 24) showed that gross brain atrophy was detectable in CBD irrespective of whether first symptoms were motor or cognitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Brain atrophy was progressive and, in contrast to PSP, was similar to that seen in other frontotemporal dementia tauopathies. There is also depigmentation and degeneration of the substantia nigra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].</p><p>On microscopic examination, the cortex shows loss of neurons and gliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,10,12,16,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,12,16,64</a>]. The deeper layers of the involved cortex show achromatic ballooned neurons that are comprised of neurofilaments, with eccentrically located nuclei and almost complete loss of Nissl substance. Subcortical nuclei are affected variably, but the pars compacta of the substantia nigra usually shows uniformly severe loss of neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Neurofibrillary tangles are found variably in the neurons of the cortex, striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but are absent in the hippocampus, occipital cortex, and inferior and medial temporal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The distribution of subcortical neurofibrillary tangles in CBD is similar to that seen in PSP, but the strands have a more thread-like appearance in CBD, rather than the globose appearance typical of PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tau-positive astrocytic plaques are presently considered highly suggestive of CBD, as are tau inclusions in the glia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. These same astrocytic plaques, however, are reported in cases of PSP as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/12,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,65</a>]. Tau-positive glial pathology and ballooned neurons have additionally been reported in Pick disease and PSP, but are considered diagnostic of CBD in the absence of numerous Pick bodies and globose neurofibrillary tangles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Neuropil threads and basophilic inclusions are present in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Abnormally configured tau protein is a common neuropathological feature of CBD and PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Although CBD and PSP are considered sporadic disorders, both are associated with a greater frequency of homozygosity for the H1 tau haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Tau-associated pathology shows up predominantly in the corpus callosum and parasagittal and paracentral gyri in CBD, as contrasted with PSP, where these findings are concentrated in subcortical regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In CBD, the tau histopathology correlates with areas of cortical atrophy.</p><p>Tau is a protein that is expressed mainly in neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. It is involved in axonal transport and stabilization of neuronal microtubules. Abnormal phosphorylation of tau interferes with microtubule function, impairs axonal transport, and leads to tau aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles. Normal brain tau contains six isoforms that are generated by alternative messenger RNA splicing of a single tau gene on chromosome 17. Alternative splicing of exon 10 results in isoforms with either three-repeats (3R) or four-repeats (4R) of the tau microtubule binding domain. The normal ratio of 3R-tau and 4R-tau is approximately equal; disruption of the normal ratio is thought to lead to neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Isoforms common to both CBD and PSP are aggregates of the 4R-tau that occur because of splicing of exon 10. In contrast, the 3R-tau form dominates in the aggregates of some other tau disorders, such as Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The uniqueness of CBD pathology and its distinction as a separate disease came into question with the advances in molecular biology demonstrating a link to the tau haplotype H1 that is associated with tau protein pathology in PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As illustrated above, findings once thought unique to CBD have been increasingly recognized in other neurodegenerative disorders that display tau-associated pathology, particularly PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/4,12,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,62</a>]. These findings have led some experts to suggest that these two entities, expressed clinically as different phenotypes, are actually the same disease, or at least genetically linked. However, while both PSP and CBD are more frequently associated with homozygosity for the H1 tau haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>], the H1 haplotype is also more common in patients with Parkinson disease compared with controls, even though tau accumulation and aggregation are not a part of its pathological picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], except in the late stages when dementia often occurs and Alzheimer pathology is present in a significant minority of autopsied brains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Therefore, the significance of the shared genetic associations among these disorders is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100657484\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is made clinically, relying on the history and neurologic examination (see <a href=\"#H7743087\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below). Neuropathologic assessment remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (see <a href=\"#H168533548\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathophysiology'</a> above). The clinical diagnosis of CBS is challenging because of the wide variety of presentations, which include early behavioral or cognitive impairment in addition to the classic asymmetric akinetic-rigid motor syndrome with apraxia. Nevertheless, the classic asymmetric syndrome is relatively specific for the diagnosis, whereas the other phenotypes are less so. (See <a href=\"#H7743080\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no established biologic markers for the disease. Routine blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid examinations are all unrevealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/16,17,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,41</a>]. Structural and functional imaging studies can be employed but none is considered sensitive enough to reliably distinguish CBD from other atypical parkinsonian syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/17,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,71,72</a>]. Structural brain imaging may be most helpful when done serially at 6 to 12 month intervals, as abnormalities become apparent over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Tests of olfaction can be a useful diagnostic tool, since olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia or anosmia) is common in Parkinson disease, rare in CBD and progressive supranuclear palsy, and is mildly impaired in multiple system atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Olfactory testing'</a>.)</p><p>One of the hallmarks of the CBD is poor or no responsiveness to levodopa therapy, a feature that is sometimes employed as a diagnostic screening tool for patients with suspected CBD who have prominent motor symptoms. The response to levodopa therapy can be tested using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> up to <span class=\"nowrap\">25/250</span> mg administered three times a day for at least two months. The response to levodopa is considered poor if the extrapyramidal features do not show marked improvement, or if the therapeutic effect is transient (ie, lasts less than a year). With little response, the drug should be tapered off gradually, although some patients may prefer to continue taking it if they notice deterioration of function during the tapering.</p><p>An excellent response to dopaminergic therapy is an important supportive feature for establishing the diagnosis of Parkinson disease, as discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Response to dopaminergic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450881492\"><span class=\"h2\">Antemortem versus postmortem diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical diagnosis of CBS does not reliably predict the neuropathologic diagnosis of CBD.

Conversely, among 19 cases with a pathologic diagnosis of CBD, a correct antemortem clinical diagnosis was made in 5 (26 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 19 cases of pathologically confirmed CBD from the UK brain bank, five had been diagnosed correctly in life, yielding a sensitivity of 26 percent, and four of these had received an alternative earlier diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Eight were diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Of 21 cases with a clinical diagnosis of CBS, only 5 had CBD pathology, giving a positive predictive value of 24 percent. Six others had PSP. Forty-two percent of CBD cases presented clinically with a progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype and 29 percent of cases had PSP pathology. &#160;</p><p/><p>These results suggest that the phenotype of CBS is nonspecific with respect to the underlying neuropathology, and that CBD is often misdiagnosed during life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/23,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,73</a>]. However, for most of the studies cited above, the experience of the practitioners who made the clinical diagnosis of CBS is uncertain. Unlike Parkinson disease, the accuracy of movement disorder specialist diagnoses in atypical parkinsonism has not been well-studied. Thus, the generally poor performance for the antemortem diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">CBS/CBD</span> revealed in the available data may relate to inadequate recognition of the clinical features and the lack of truly discriminating clinical criteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7743087\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of clinical and research criteria for CBD have been proposed, but none have been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/8,17,74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,74-76</a>].

Functional imaging studies cannot reliably distinguish CBD from other atypical parkinsonian syndromes.</p><p>DaTscan, ie, striatal dopamine transporter imaging using 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), is generally abnormal in CBD in a manner similar to Parkinson disease and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. Compared with patients who had Parkinson disease, one study reported that FP-CIT binding reduction in patients with CBD was characterized by increased variability, more uniform reduction throughout the striatum (as opposed to greater putaminal loss in Parkinson disease), and greater hemispheric asymmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

In addition, there is bilateral and symmetric reduction in thalamic blood flow in patients with CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. These results demonstrated a greater reduction in cerebral cortical blood flow and more asymmetry than those patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>The positron emission tomography (PET) finding most typical of CBD is asymmetric cerebral glucose hypometabolism most prominent in the posterior frontal, inferior parietal, and superior temporal regions, thalamus, and striatum of the more affected hemisphere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/60,72,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,72,81,82</a>]. There is also an asymmetric decrease in global cortical oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In a small pilot study using PET, an automated algorithm, using multiple measures, distinguished patients with CBD (a tauopathy) from those with multiple system atrophy (a synucleinopathy) but not progressive supranuclear palsy (another tauopathy) based upon asymmetric variance in regional brain metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Of note, progressive supranuclear palsy and CBD can be hard to distinguish clinically and are closely related pathologically. This PET method requires validation in larger studies. The availability of PET imaging is generally limited to research centers.</p><p>Analysis of brain atrophy by MRI voxel-based morphometry is another method that may be useful to differentiate the underlying pathology of patients who present clinically with CBS. In a case-control study of 24 patients diagnosed on clinical grounds with CBS who had MRI during life and came to autopsy, a neuropathologic diagnosis of CBD was made in 7, Alzheimer disease in 6, progressive supranuclear palsy in 6, and frontotemporal lobe degeneration in 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Focal atrophy detected on MRI by voxel-based morphometry in premotor and supplemental motor areas was suggestive of CBD or progressive supranuclear palsy, while more widespread atrophy was suggestive of frontotemporal lobe degeneration or Alzheimer disease. A subsequent study evaluated 18 patients with an autopsy diagnosis of CBD and 40 patients with known histopathology who presented with clinical CBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Anterior spread of atrophy from the perirolandic regions suggested that the underlying pathology was CBD, while brainstem and subcortical atrophy was more likely with progressive supranuclear palsy pathology, and posterior spread to temporoparietal cortex was more likely with Alzheimer pathology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7743108\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When presenting primarily with motor symptoms, corticobasal degeneration is most often misdiagnosed as either idiopathic Parkinson disease (because of the asymmetric presentation of both disorders), progressive supranuclear palsy, or multiple system atrophy (predominant parkinsonism subtype) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79095\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79095 \">table 3</a>).

In two reports with at total of 29 cases of pathologically confirmed CBD, the median survival was 5.5 and 7.9 years, respectively (range 2 to 12.5 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The most common cause of death is from complications of immobility or dysphagia, such as pneumonia and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/corticobasal-degeneration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428740953\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) was originally described as an asymmetric, akinetic-rigid neurodegenerative syndrome with cerebral cortical dysfunction. It is now recognized that pathologically proven CBD often begins as a cognitive or behavioral disturbance. Because the cognitive and motor features considered characteristic of CBD are not specific to CBD, the term &quot;corticobasal syndrome&quot; (CBS) is used for cases with a clinical diagnosis, while &quot;corticobasal degeneration&quot; (CBD) is reserved for cases with neuropathologic confirmation. (See <a href=\"#H7743066\" class=\"local\">'Historical aspects and nomenclature'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated annual incidence of CBD ranges from 0.62 to 0.92 per 100,000 population, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 5 to 7 per 100,000 population. The disease typically presents in the sixth to eighth decades of life with onset of symptoms occurring at a mean age of 61 to 64 years. (See <a href=\"#H7743073\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic description of CBD is that of a progressive asymmetric movement disorder with symptoms initially affecting one limb, including various combinations of akinesia and extreme rigidity, dystonia, focal myoclonus, ideomotor apraxia, and alien limb phenomenon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55825 \">table 1</a>). Cognitive impairment is a common manifestation of CBD and may be a presenting feature, while the parkinsonian motor features may emerge later as the disease progresses. Important cognitive features of CBD include executive dysfunction, aphasia, apraxia, behavioral change, and visuospatial dysfunction, with relatively preserved episodic memory. (See <a href=\"#H7743080\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In early stages of CBD, brain imaging with CT and MRI may be normal. As the disease progresses, abnormalities in the form of asymmetric cortical atrophy are observed in up to half of patients. Focal atrophy predominantly involves the posterior frontal and parietal regions, along with dilatation of the lateral ventricles. (See <a href=\"#H168532478\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologically, CBD is characterized by asymmetric frontoparietal atrophy with extensive neuronal loss, gliosis, and ballooned, achromatic neurons. Subcortical nuclei are affected variably, but the pars compacta of the substantia nigra usually shows uniformly severe loss of neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles are found in the neurons of the cortex, striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and brainstem. The distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in CBD is similar to that seen in progressive supranuclear palsy, but the strands have a more thread-like appearance in CBD rather than the globose appearance typical of progressive supranuclear palsy. A fundamental abnormality of the cytoskeletal protein tau is the underlying pathologic substrate of CBD. Tau-positive astrocytic plaques are considered highly suggestive of CBD, as are tau inclusions in the glia. (See <a href=\"#H168533548\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is made clinically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F98951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98951 \">table 2</a>). Neuropathologic assessment remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The clinical diagnosis of CBS is often difficult because of the wide variety of reported presentations, which include predominant cognitive impairment rather than the classic asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome with apraxia. There are no established biological markers for CBD. When presenting primarily with motor symptoms, CBD is most often misdiagnosed as either idiopathic Parkinson disease (because of the typical asymmetric presentation of both disorders), progressive supranuclear palsy, or multiple systems atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79095\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79095 \">table 3</a>). A poor or unsustained response to levodopa therapy is generally observed in patients with CBD and may help to distinguish it from idiopathic Parkinson disease. Certain disorders associated with predominant dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia (including Pick disease), can present rarely with focal myoclonus, apraxia, alien limb phenomena, and rigidity, making them difficult to distinguish from CBD with dementia.

The response can be tested using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> up to <span class=\"nowrap\">25/250</span> mg administered three times a day for at least two months. The response is considered poor if the extrapyramidal features do not show marked improvement, or if the usually modest therapeutic effect is transient (ie, lasts less than a year). With little response, the drug should be tapered off gradually, although some patients may prefer to continue taking it if they notice deterioration of function during the tapering. (See <a href=\"#H7743115\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median survival from onset of symptoms with CBD is 6 to 8 years and ranges from 2 to 13 years.
