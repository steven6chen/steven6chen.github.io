The approach to management of shunt infections is discussed here.</p><p>Indications for shunt placement and other issues related to hydrocephalus are discussed separately.

The distal portion of the shunt can be internalized or externalized. Internalized shunts most commonly drain into the peritoneum (ventriculoperitoneal [VP] shunt), although, less commonly, they drain into the vascular space (ventriculoatrial [VA] shunt) or the pleural space (ventriculopleural shunt).</p><p>Externalized devices (ventriculostomy catheters, also called external ventricular drains [EVDs]) are temporary devices typically placed in the setting of acute hydrocephalus for intracranial pressure monitoring and therapeutic diversion of cerebrospinal fluid. They may also be placed for interim management of hydrocephalus during antibiotic therapy for an infected internalized device that has been removed.</p><p>Other externalized CSF drainage devices such as Ommaya reservoirs (for administration of antimicrobial drugs or cancer chemotherapy) can also become infected. The proximal portion of these devices is typically placed in the intraventricular space but may also be placed in an abscess cavity or tumor. The distal portion of the device is a reservoir placed under the scalp (less commonly in the lumbar space) and accessed via a needle when needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of internalized CSF shunt infection in most studies has ranged from approximately 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>].

This may occur at the time of surgery or postoperatively via breakdown of the wound or overlying skin. These infections occur in the early weeks after shunt placement, and staphylococci are the predominant pathogens. Early infection with skin flora is the most common type of cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection; about half of all shunt infections are due to coagulase-negative staphylococci and about a third of cases are due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/2,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19-24</a>]. Diphtheroids (such as <em>Cutibacterium </em>[formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>]<em> acnes</em> and <em>Corynebacterium jeikeium</em>) may also be pathogenic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-due-to-coagulase-negative-staphylococci-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection due to coagulase-negative staphylococci: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Shunt infections may also develop via direct contamination of the distal end of the shunt or via hematogenous seeding. Distal-end contamination of ventriculoperitoneal shunts occurs in the setting of bowel perforation or peritonitis, whereas contamination of externalized devices occurs via catheter irrigation or tracking of microorganisms along the exit site. These infections tend to occur months after shunt placement and account for about 10 to 15 percent of shunt infections. They may be due to a variety of organisms including streptococci, gram-negative bacteria (including <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>), anaerobes, mycobacteria, and fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/15,25-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSF shunt infections can present with few or no symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In some cases, symptoms develop only when infection has caused shunt obstruction and subsequent malfunction with clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> lethargy, or altered mental status). Meningeal symptoms may not be observed because communication between the infected ventricles and the meninges is usually absent (this is the reason for the shunt). Fever may or may not be present.</p><p>Another reason that the clinical manifestation may be subtle or absent is that commonly implicated pathogens, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and <em>C. acnes</em>, are indolent, cause minimal inflammation, and are primarily pathogenic when prosthetic material is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In some cases, there may be only mechanical blockage as a result of biofilm formation in or on the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,38,39</a>].</p><p>Symptoms may also present with localization to the distal internal (ventriculoperitoneal [VP], ventriculopleural, or ventriculoatrial [VA] shunts) or external end of the shunt:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VP shunt infections may manifest with symptoms of peritonitis, including fever, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Large loculated pockets can develop in the peritoneum because of diminished CSF absorption in the setting of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Subsequent endocarditis and its concomitant sequelae can occur, including septic pulmonary emboli and antibody-mediated sequelae such as glomerulonephritis and dermatologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

However, many patients requiring an EVD have an impaired level of consciousness related to the underlying disease for which the EVD was placed, making it difficult to assess whether changes are due to infection. New fever and increased CSF white blood cell count may also suggest infection in patients with EVDs.</p><p>In patients with intrathecal infusion pumps, new fever and drainage from the surgical site are suggestive of wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1995524319\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network has described healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis as being present in patients who meet at least one of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An organism cultured from the CSF</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two of the following signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause in patients aged &gt;1 year of age: fever &gt;38&deg;C or headache, meningeal signs, or cranial nerve signs, or at least two of the following signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause in patients aged &le;1 year of age: fever &gt;38&deg;C or hypothermia &lt;36&deg;C, apnea, bradycardia, or irritability <strong>and</strong> at least one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased CSF white blood cell count, elevated CSF protein, and decreased CSF glucose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Organisms seen on a CSF Gram stain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Organisms cultured from the blood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive nonculture diagnostic test from the CSF, blood, or urine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diagnostic single-antibody titer (immunoglobulin M) or fourfold increase in paired sera (immunoglobulin G) for organism</p><p/><p>However, a nonculture diagnostic test or antibody titers for specific organisms are not often used in patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If clinical manifestations suggest the possibility of infection, a diagnostic evaluation should be initiated with cerebrospinal fluid analysis, blood cultures, and imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct aspiration of the CSF shunt is preferred over ventricular tap or lumbar puncture when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/21,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,43</a>]. The CSF should be examined for white cell count with differential, glucose and protein concentrations, Gram stain, and culture. CSF cultures are the most important test for establishing the diagnosis of CSF shunt infections and external ventricular drain (EVD) infections and should be obtained before starting antibiotics. In some cases, other studies can be useful, as discussed below.

Central nervous system (CNS) device-related infections often manifest with less inflammation than bacterial meningitis; as a result, cell count abnormalities may be subtle and difficult to distinguish from postoperative inflammation. In a retrospective report of 11 pediatric shunt infections, for example, 5 had CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">12/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The WBC differential may be a useful clue to CSF shunt infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In one report of 129 shunt placements, a WBC count differential in CSF with &gt;10 percent neutrophils was 90 percent sensitive for predicting infection; the negative predictive value was 0.99. The presence of eosinophils in CSF is controversial with regard to infection specificity. While some studies indicate that the presence of eosinophils is rare in the setting of infection and should raise the possibility of inflammation due to shunt malfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>], another study found that CSF eosinophilia of &gt;8 percent of the differential count was associated with indolent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A study that used &gt;1 percent eosinophils as the cutoff demonstrated an association with both infection and a variety of noninfectious entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and has prompted continued controversy regarding the utility of CSF eosinophilia in the diagnosis of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2310511493\"><span class=\"h3\">Gram stain and culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A negative CSF Gram stain does not exclude infection, particularly in patients who have received antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As noted above, CSF cultures are the most important test for establishing the diagnosis of CSF shunt infections and EVD infections and should be obtained before starting antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A negative CSF culture in the setting of previous antibiotics does not exclude infection. If the initial CSF culture is negative and infection is considered likely, the CSF culture should be repeated. Positive cultures from the thioglycolate broth only should be interpreted with caution as they may represent a contaminant rather than infection, but, in patients who have received antibiotics, they could represent infection.</p><p>If a CSF shunt or drain is removed in a patient suspected of having infection, the shunt or drain components should be cultured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Close follow-up after placement of a new shunt is important to ensure that the infection has been adequately treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280853501\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring the response to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis and an external CSF drainage device (eg, an external ventricular drain [EVD]) should be monitored for a response to therapy using clinical parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, CSF cultures should be rechecked to ensure that they have become negative. No data exist on the appropriate frequency of rechecking CSF cultures; we typically recheck them at 48- to 72-hour intervals. In patients without clear clinical improvement, additional CSF analysis should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients who have an EVD for an indication other than infection, daily CSF cultures and other CSF analysis are <strong>not</strong> recommended unless there is a clinical indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rationale for this recommendation is that the results of such surveillance do not reliably predict infection and may increase the risk of iatrogenic infection. In one retrospective study, daily cultures did not identify infection before clinical signs and symptoms developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. In a prospective study of patients with an external drainage device, CSF samples showed no significant differences in leukocyte count, protein concentration, glucose concentration, or <span class=\"nowrap\">CSF/blood</span> glucose ratio between the patients in whom meningitis developed and a control group without EVD-associated meningitis during the first three days of infection or during the three days preceding the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In addition, Gram staining had low sensitivity for detecting infection (18 percent on the first day of infection; 60 percent on the second day of infection). Thus, a positive Gram stain can be quite helpful, but a negative one is less useful.</p><p>In a prospective study of patients with EVDs in whom CSF was tested daily, the only parameter that correlated with a positive CSF culture was CSF cell count; peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count, CSF glucose, and CSF protein were not reliable predictors of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective study of patients with EVDs that compared clinical and laboratory findings at the time of EVD insertion and at the time of documented infection, the two most reliable indicators of infection were increasing CSF pleocytosis (median WBC count <span class=\"nowrap\">175/microL)</span> and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures for prevention of CSF shunt infection include meticulous adherence to surgical and sterile technique (including topical antiseptic), short procedure times, and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].

Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis for the duration of external ventricular drain (EVD) use is <strong>not</strong> recommended, as it has not been proven to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery were published in 2013, representing the views of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In these guidelines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (2 g intravenously [IV] for nonobese adults and 3 g IV for adults &gt;120 kg; 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV for children) given 60 minutes prior to the incision is recommended for patients undergoing clean neurosurgical procedures, including cerebrospinal fluid shunting procedures and intrathecal pump placement. We agree with this recommendation. Cefazolin should be redosed at four-hour intervals until the surgery is over (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87202 \">table 2</a>). The IDSA guidelines for the management of healthcare-associated meningitis and ventriculitis suggest that antibiotics be continued for as long as 24 hours postoperatively as this is the duration that has been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but, as noted above, we prefer to give antibiotics only prior to and during the surgical procedure.</p><p>It should be noted that some experts prefer either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> alone or adding vancomycin to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>. The rationale for using vancomycin alone or with cefazolin is that coagulase-negative staphylococci, many of which are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> resistant, are commonly implicated in CSF shunt infections. Also, some add vancomycin to cefazolin in cases in which prior methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) colonization or infection has been documented or when the patient is at increased risk of MRSA colonization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53504 \">table 3</a>). The dosing of vancomycin is 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (not to exceed 2 g) IV. It is important to note that the usual timing of antibiotic administration is 60 minutes prior to the incision; since vancomycin requires a prolonged infusion time, it should be started two hours prior to the incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-of-cerebrospinal-fluid-shunts-and-other-devices/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Only a single preoperative dose of vancomycin is necessary given its long half-life.
