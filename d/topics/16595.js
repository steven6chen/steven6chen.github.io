Significant pathology requiring surgical intervention may result from hyperplasia, adenoma formation, or malignancy. </p><p>Adrenal surgery often is the primary treatment modality for a multitude of adrenal conditions. As a result, a strong working knowledge of adrenal embryology and anatomy is essential. Adrenalectomy can be performed by open or laparoscopic techniques with use of various approaches (anterior, lateral, or posterior) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-anatomy-of-the-adrenal-glands/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

By the eighth week of fetal development, these cortical elements have differentiated into a thin outer definitive cortex and a thick inner fetal cortex.

A normal adrenal gland in an adult weighs approximately 4 to 6 grams. The left adrenal is larger and flatter than the right adrenal gland. The weight of each adrenal may increase by nearly 50 percent during times of stress and pregnancy.

The blood supply to both the cortex and medulla increases during periods of stress. ACTH produces an immediate increase in blood flow to the adrenals. </p><p>Arterial and venous capillaries within the adrenal gland integrate the function of the cortex and medulla. Cortisol-rich effluent flows from the cortex to the medulla, where it stimulates of the synthesis and activity of the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), leading to the conversion of norepinephrine to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.

Because any arteries approaching the gland can branch and re-branch, the number of adjacent vessels entering it may be quite numerous. There is no constant position in which these arteries enter the gland. This anatomic detail is important because encountering these small vessels in the perirenal fat indicates proximity of the gland, and the feeding vessels will bleed unless cauterized or ligated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-anatomy-of-the-adrenal-glands/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3317737\"><span class=\"h1\">VENOUS DRAINAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With rare exceptions, each adrenal gland has a single draining vein.

(See <a href=\"#H29523668\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adrenal glands are retroperitoneal and are located on the superior medial aspect of the upper pole of each kidney. (See <a href=\"#H29523675\" class=\"local\">'Size and location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adrenal glands have a rich, multiple arterial supply from three main groups of vessels: the superior suprarenal arteries, the middle suprarenal artery and the inferior suprarenal renal arteries. (See <a href=\"#H29523696\" class=\"local\">'Blood supply'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular control of the adrenal vein is more difficult on the right than the left because the right adrenal vein is less than a centimeter in length and empties directly into the posterior inferior vena cava, which creates a risk for injury and hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H3317737\" class=\"local\">'Venous drainage'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-anatomy-of-the-adrenal-glands/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wells SA, Merke DP, Cutler GB Jr, et al.
