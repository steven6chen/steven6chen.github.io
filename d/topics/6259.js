Following a brief discussion about the definition of asthma and the identification of affected individuals, studies of asthma prevalence are reviewed. The definition, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DATA COLLECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential to any study of prevalence are the definition of the disease being studied and the methods available to identify affected individuals. Although many definitions and methods of data collection have been used and reported, herein we discuss the most common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definition of asthma that incorporates both a positive test of airway hyperresponsiveness and symptoms was proposed and tested for epidemiologic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The study defined &quot;current asthma&quot; as bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in the presence of wheezing in the 12 months prior to the study. According to this definition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Current asthma&quot; identified a group of children with more severe BHR, greater peak flow variability, more symptoms, more atopy, and more medication use than children with BHR alone or wheeze alone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who only had wheeze did not differ from the normal group except in reporting symptoms and in more associated use of asthma medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with BHR only were intermediate in severity, in terms of BHR and other study parameters, between the normal and current asthma groups</p><p/><p>It appears, therefore, that this definition identifies a group of children with clinically important asthma. Because therapy can return both symptoms and BHR to the normal range, the authors recommend extending the definition of current asthma to include subjects who have had their illness recognized by a clinician. This definition may not be as useful in adults because of the effects of smoking and because BHR has been unable to adequately distinguish asthma from chronic bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologists have relied primarily on historic or questionnaire sources to identify patients with asthma. Adding to the inherent limitations of questionnaires, different studies have used different symptom questionnaires, and cases have been identified either by physicians or by surveys of population groups in which the definition of who has asthma has been left to the patients themselves, the parents of patients, or to the report of the diagnosis by the patient's clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other studies have included objective tests of lung function and airway responsiveness in the identification of asthma.</p><p>Each method of selecting asthma patients has its inherent problems. It is likely that some bias in reporting of cases is present in each group and that the biases in each approach are different. The table summarizes the potential problems of the various approaches to identifying persons with asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73952 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>As part of ongoing studies, a 1996 report validated questionnaire-defined asthma and BHR versus respiratory clinician assessment of current asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Using the Tasmanian Asthma Survey (TAS) questionnaire for adults and the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) questionnaire for children, subjects with symptoms in the past year were identified. BHR testing was conducted using hypertonic saline. Subjects were then interviewed by one of two respiratory physicians who were blinded to the results of the questionnaires and BHR testing. A clinician diagnosis of &quot;current asthma&quot; was defined as a history of wheeze suggestive of a clinical diagnosis of asthma within the past 12 months.</p><p>Using the clinician's diagnosis as the &quot;gold standard,&quot; questionnaire responses alone were found to be sensitive (0.80 for adults, 0.85 for children) and specific (0.97 for adults, 0.81 for children). Questionnaire response plus BHR was found to have high specificity (0.99 for adults, 0.94 for children) but low sensitivity (0.37 for adults, 0.47 for children). This study, however, did not incorporate a previous asthma diagnosis to the definitions of asthma, particularly for the children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOBAL VARIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The literature is replete with studies reporting the prevalence of asthma and asthma-like symptoms from different countries around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. However, comparison of these prevalence estimates has been difficult given the different methods used between studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Two multicenter studies, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) and the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) are addressing this issue. Reports from ISAAC have confirmed the wide variations in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in children worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. This study employed standardized simple surveys which were conducted among representative samples of school children in two age groups (6 to 7 and 13 to 14 years) in 61 countries. In a subset, a video asthma questionnaire was also administered.</p><p>For the ISAAC surveys conducted from 2000 to 2002, there was marked variation in the prevalence of wheeze in the last 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, in the younger age group, the prevalence of wheeze ranged from 2.4 to 37.6 percent with lowest rates in India, Indonesia, the Isle of Man, and Malaysia and highest rates in Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica, New Zealand, and Panama. In the older age group, the difference in prevalence between countries ranged from 0.8 to 32.6 percent with lowest rates in China and India and the highest rates in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>For asthma prevalence, the variations were just as large as for wheeze in the last 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For example, among six to seven year olds, prevalence of ever having asthma ranged from 3.4 percent in Africa to 29.2 percent in Oceania; among the 13 to 14 year olds, prevalence ranged from 5.1 percent in Northern and Eastern Europe to 22 percent in Oceania. The authors point out that a striking feature of the data is the high rates of asthma symptoms (23 percent of 13 to 14 year olds) in countries whose predominant language is English.</p><p>The ECRHS is a multicenter survey of the prevalence, determinants, and management of asthma in 20 to 44 year old adults from 48 centers, predominantly in Western Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As in the ISAAC reports, the prevalence of all symptoms varied widely. Wheeze prevalence ranged from 4.1 to 9.7 percent from centers in India, Algeria, and Italy to 23.2 to 32 percent from centers in Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. Asthma prevalence ranged from 2 to 3.3 percent from centers in Estonia, Germany, Spain, Greece, Austria, Algeria, and Italy, to 8 to 11.9 percent from centers in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.</p><p>As with the ISAAC results, English speaking centers had a generally high prevalence of symptoms in the ECRHS survey. This remains unexplained and will require further study. One may speculate, however, that being in an English speaking center may be a marker for an exposure which increases the risk for asthma and asthma-like symptoms.</p><p>The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) summarized data from both ECRHS and ISAAC in the Global Burden of Asthma report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Highlights of this report are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As of 2004, it was estimated that as many as 300 million people of all ages suffer from asthma. By 2025, it is expected that this number will rise to 400 million worldwide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of asthma increases as communities adopt western lifestyles and become urbanized. Despite this knowledge, the international patterns of asthma prevalence cannot be explained by the current knowledge of potential causes for the development of asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in the prevalence of asthma has been associated with an increase in atopic sensitization, and is paralleled by similar increases in other allergic disorders such as eczema and rhinitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is estimated that asthma accounts for about 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide. Many of these could be prevented with optimal access to medical care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The direct (eg, hospital admissions and pharmaceutical costs) and indirect (eg, time lost from work or school) economic cost of asthma is considerable.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TRENDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the Centers for Disease Control have shown that the prevalence of asthma increased in the United States from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. During the period from 1982 to 1992, the overall annual age-adjusted prevalence rate of self-reported asthma increased by 42 percent, from 34.7 to 49.4 per 1000. For the younger age group 5 to 34 years, where the diagnosis of asthma is thought to be more accurate, the rate increased from 34.6 to 52.6 per 1000, an increase of 52 percent. Since that time, the prevalence of asthma has increased more gradually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. During the years 2001 through 2009, the age-adjusted prevalence of asthma increased from 7.3 to 8.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Analysis of data from the 2001 to 2013 National Health Interview Survey for children aged 0 to 17 years has shown a plateau of the adjusted prevalence of asthma between 2009 and 2012, and a decline in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Subgroup analyses showed that from 2001 to 2013, there was no change in prevalence for non-Hispanic white and Puerto Rican children and children living in the Northeastern and Western United States; continued increase in prevalence among 10 to 17 year olds, poor children, and those living in the Southern United States; increase followed by a plateau among 5 to 9 year olds, near-poor children, and non-Hispanic black children; and increase followed by a decrease in prevalence among 0 to 4 year olds, non-poor, Mexican children, and those living in the Midwestern United States. Puerto Rican children remained the subgroup with the highest asthma prevalence as of 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>As noted above, asthma prevalence varies around the world. While most countries saw an increase in prevalence of asthma toward the end of the last century, data since 2000 has shown differing trends. While asthma prevalence continues to rise after the year 2000 in some countries such as Italy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] and Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], other countries such as Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] have seen a plateau of prevalence from data through 2010 and 2014, respectively.</p><p>The annual death rate from asthma in the United States also increased from 1982 to 1995, but has declined since then (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59239 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Consistently higher rates have been reported for blacks than for whites, but not for Hispanic or Latino ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This difference in death rates is thought to be due both to socioeconomic factors and to differences in access to medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>].</p><p>These overall trends are not unique to the United States. Use of the same methods in other countries has also shown that the prevalence of asthma is on the rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Some areas have seen a moderation or even a decline in mortality. For example, in an analysis of data between 1969 and 1993 in New Zealand, mortality rates peaked in 1979 and began falling in the early 1980s to a low of 0.5 deaths per 100,000 in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. According to an analysis of asthma mortality data from 20 countries, asthma death rates, which increased during the 1980s, have significantly decreased subsequently to a level of 0.23 deaths per 100,000 in 2004 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>Several explanations for the observed increase in prevalence have been suggested. Increased clinician and public awareness of the signs and symptoms of asthma could have led to a change in diagnostic recognition and accuracy. However, changes in disease classification and the effects of the 1979 ICD revision have probably had only a minor impact. It is likely that changes in the risk factors thought to cause and worsen asthma are responsible for much of the increase in asthma prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, the reasons for the plateau and potential decrease in prevalence of asthma in some countries remain unclear. It has been hypothesized that because of the rapidly changing exposures and lifestyles in the latter half of the past century, the proportion of the population that was susceptible to developing asthma was exposed (and is still being exposed, in some countries), and is now reaching capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-asthma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It is also possible that better understanding of risk factors and faster dissemination of this information to the public may have led to these changes in the trends. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H883759197\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
