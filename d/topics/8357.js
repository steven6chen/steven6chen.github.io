Persistent infection with certain types of HPV can lead to cancer of the cervix, which affects more than 10,000 American women every year. HPV can also cause cancers of the vulva and vagina in women, although these cancers are much less common than cervical cancer. HPV also causes cancers of the anus and of the oral cavity and throat, in both men and women.</p><p>Three vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil-9, and Cervarix) are globally available to prevent infection with types of HPV known to cause cervical cancer. It is clear that these vaccines significantly reduce the number of women who develop cervical pre-cancer. It is expected that this will result in substantial reduction in the number women who develop cervical cancer.</p><p>This article discusses human papillomavirus and the human papillomavirus vaccine. Articles that discuss cervical cancer, cervical cancer screening (Pap smears), and genital warts are also available (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). An article that discusses vaccines recommended for adults is also available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about human papillomavirus vaccines is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS HPV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that is spread by skin-to-skin contact, including sexual intercourse (vaginal sex), oral sex, anal sex, or any other contact involving the genital area (eg, hand to genital contact). Condoms do not provide complete protection from HPV infection because condoms do not cover all exposed genital skin. People do not become infected with HPV by touching an object, such as a toilet seat.</p><p>The risk of HPV exposure increases with the number of sexual partners you have and the number of partners your partner has. It has been estimated that 75 to 80 percent of sexually active adults will acquire HPV infection before the age of 50. A majority of women and men become infected with HPV for the first time between ages 15 and 25 years. Most people who are infected with HPV have no signs or symptoms, and in most cases, never develop any problems caused by HPV.</p><p>In 10 to 20 percent of women, however, HPV infection persists. In this situation, there is a greater chance of developing cervical pre-cancer and then cancer. However, it usually takes on average 20 to 25 years for a new HPV infection to cause cervical cancer. Thus, regular testing is important in detecting cervical abnormalities early, before cancer develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Over 100 different types of HPV have been identified; more than 40 of these are known to infect the cervix and approximately 15 are known to cause cervical cancer. Researchers have labeled the HPV types as being high or low risk for causing cervical cancer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPV types 6 and 11 can cause about 90 percent of genital warts. These types are low-risk because they do not cause cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Types 16 and 18 are the high-risk types that cause most (about 70 percent) cases of cervical cancer. HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 are also high-risk types, causing about 19 percent of cervical cancers.</p><p/><p>Three HPV vaccines are available globally. The three vaccines protect against different types of HPV:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gardasil-9 helps to prevent infection with nine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gardasil helps to prevent infection with four HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervarix helps to prevent infection with HPV types 16 and 18.</p><p/><p>In the United States, only Gardasil-9 is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HPV VACCINE TIMING AND DOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the HPV vaccines are given by injection. Dosing depends on your age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are younger than 15, you should get two injections at least six months apart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are 15 years or older, you should get three injections. The second and third doses are given one to two and six months after the first, respectively.</p><p/><p>It is best to try to get all the recommended doses. If you miss a dose, talk to your health care provider about how many more doses you need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Who should be vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, HPV vaccination is recommended for all girls and women who are between ages 9 and 26 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HPV vaccination is recommended for boys and men who are between ages 9 and 21 years. It can be given up to 26 years of age if they are men who have sex with men or have infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Gardasil-9 is the only HPV vaccine available in the United States.</p><p>With any HPV vaccine, you will have the greatest protection from HPV if you are vaccinated BEFORE becoming sexually active. The vaccine does not help to get rid of HPV infection or any cervical abnormality after it has occurred. However, if you are less than 26 years old and you have been sexually active, had genital warts, a positive HPV test, or an abnormal Pap smear, you may still obtain some (albeit smaller) benefit from the HPV vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">How long am I protected?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scientists do not know exactly how long the vaccine protects against HPV infection. Clinical trials show that it provides protection for at least eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Do I still need a Pap smear?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You do not need to have a pelvic exam or test for cervical cancer (eg, Pap smear) before you have the HPV vaccine. Cervical cancer screening (Pap smear) is recommended to start at age 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>However, getting the HPV vaccine does not mean that you can skip cervical cancer screening in the future, since the vaccine does not treat infections that might have occurred before you got the vaccine. Other types of high-risk HPV, which are not prevented by the vaccine, can also cause cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HPV VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HPV vaccine may cause mild redness, tenderness, or swelling near the injection site. There is no thimerosal (a mercury derivative used as a preservative) in the HPV vaccine. There may be an increased risk of passing out after an injection of HPV vaccine, so it is a good idea not to stand up too soon after getting the vaccine. </p><p>The vaccine is not currently recommended during pregnancy, although there are no known risks to a fetus if the vaccine is given.</p><p>Despite concerns about safety based on anecdotal reports, large studies have not confirmed major health risks of these vaccines. Most experts believe that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DOES THE VACCINE REALLY WORK?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Results from vaccine studies show that the HPV vaccine in women is very effective in preventing HPV infections and cervical pre-cancers caused by HPV types targeted by the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. HPV vaccination of women has been shown to reduce the risk of genital warts in their male sexual partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies also show that the HPV vaccine in men reduces the risk of developing genital warts and persistent penile HPV infection, which may decrease the spread of HPV to sexual partners. HPV vaccination also reduces the risk of anal cancer in both men and women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HPV vaccine is not 100 percent protective, but it is still highly effective. The HPV vaccine does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.</p><p>It is important to practice safer sex to reduce the risk of all STIs. This includes using a male or female condom with every sexual act.
