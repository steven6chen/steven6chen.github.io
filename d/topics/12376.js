ER includes endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), which involves snare resection of dysplastic lesions, and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in which endoscopic tools are used to dissect lesions from the submucosa. ER offers both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. Lesions limited to the mucosa and the superficial layers of the submucosa appear to be the most amenable to endoscopic cure.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of ER for gastrointestinal tumors. Additional information on ER for the removal of superficial esophageal cancer, high-grade dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus, early gastric cancer, and large colon polyps can be found elsewhere.

Endoscopists in the United States are increasingly utilizing ER techniques as commercially available devices become easier to use, such as band assisted mucosectomy devices. ER is also used to treat dysplasia in the setting of Barrett's esophagus and for the removal of large colon polyps.

In one study with 37 patients undergoing ESD for a gastric subepithelial tumor, complete en bloc resection was achieved in 30 patients (81 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Higher resection rates were seen for tumors in the submucosa compared with those from the muscularis propria (100 versus 68 percent). There were no recurrences in the patients who had complete resections after a median follow-up of 21 months. However, in a second study of 90 patients who underwent endoscopic resection primarily for gastric or small bowel gastrointestinal stromal tumors (one patient had an esophageal tumor), complete resection with negative margins was achieved in 23 patients (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In a small retrospective series, treating with esophageal balloon dilation plus an oral steroid was associated with a reduced need for esophageal balloon dilation compared with esophageal balloon dilation alone, though randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. The treatment of refractory strictures may include injecting depo-type corticosteroids such as triamcinolone into the stricture following dilation.

The bleeding was controlled with injection therapy, monopolar electrocoagulation, ligation with a detachable snare, and endoscopic clipping. In another report, delayed bleeding (occurring from 6 to 166 hours after the procedure [median 33 hours]) was observed in 25 of 476 patients (5 percent). The only independent risk factor associated with delayed bleeding was immediate bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Bleeding can be difficult to control. We have found endoscopic application of a hemoclip to be a reliable and safe method for controlling bleeding.</p><p>In a study of ESD for 1192 gastric neoplasms, there were 1166 ESD-induced ulcers, with bleeding in 62 cases (5.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. There were 30 cases (2.6 percent) of early bleeding and 32 cases (2.7 percent) of late bleeding. A specimen size of &gt;40 mm was a risk factor for bleeding overall, and antithrombotic drug therapy was a risk factor for delayed (but not early) bleeding. </p><p>Perforation has also been described and is more common with ESD. A meta-analysis found that the perforation rate for ESD was 4.5 percent, compared with 1.0 percent for EMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Treatment of a perforation generally requires open or laparoscopic surgery, although endoscopic clipping can be used for small perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>].

Post endoscopic submucosal dissection electrocoagulation syndrome develops when electrical current applied during the procedure extends past the mucosa into the muscularis propria and serosa, resulting in a transmural burn without perforation. Symptoms include fever, rebound tenderness, and marked leukocytosis. In a series with 82 patients who underwent ESD in the colon or rectum, post endoscopic submucosal dissection electrocoagulation syndrome was reported in 33 patients (40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>].

ER includes endoscopic mucosal resection, which involves snare resection of dysplastic lesions, and endoscopic submucosal dissection in which endoscopic tools are used to dissect lesions from the submucosa. Endoscopic resection offers both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest experience, mostly from Japanese reports, has been in the treatment of gastric and esophageal neoplasms. The role of ER for staging and treating dysplastic Barrett's in conjunction with mucosal ablative techniques like radiofrequency ablation is growing. ER is also being used in the treatment of colonic neoplasms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The techniques for endoscopic mucosal resection can be broadly divided into two groups: suction (suck-and-cut) and non-suction (lift-and-cut) techniques. Regardless of the resection technique, a SFC is highly desirable to separate mucosal and submucosal lesions from the muscularis propria. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic resection techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a modified ER technique which utilizes a specialized electrocautery knife to incise and dissect the lesion through the submucosa. It offers the potential to remove mucosal and some submucosal tumors en bloc without size limitations. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic submucosal dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up studies suggest that ER in carefully selected patients can achieve long-term cure, although the number of patients reported is relatively small. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In experienced hands, ER is a safe procedure that can be performed on outpatients. However, a number of adverse events have been described, including stricture formation, bleeding and perforations. (See <a href=\"#H1942073\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3768634616\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Dr. Mustafa Kathawala, MD, and Dr. Christopher Gostout, MD, for their contributions as author to prior versions of this topic review. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Technology status report evaluation.
