Systemic therapy for advanced cholangiocarcinoma will be reviewed here. Surgical and other local treatments for cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary cancer; epidemiology, pathology, classification, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of cholangiocarcinomas and ampullary cancers; and systemic therapy for gallbladder cancer are all discussed elsewhere.

A benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care alone was suggested in a trial that randomly assigned 90 patients with advanced pancreatic or biliary cancer (37 with bile duct cancer) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU)-based systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care alone (median survival 6 versus 2.5 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The literature regarding treatment results with specific regimens is limited because most series are small, and many reports consist of a mix of bile duct cancers, gallbladder cancer, ampullary cancer, and either pancreatic or hepatocellular cancers. Although they arise in similar locations, these cancers all have a unique natural history and response to chemotherapy. In general, no single drug or combination has consistently increased median survival beyond the expected six to eight months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer are a heterogeneous group, comprising both locally advanced and metastatic disease, as well as a variety of primary disease sites (intrahepatic bile ducts, extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and ampulla). This heterogeneity complicates assessment of treatment efficacy.</p><p>The prognostic influence of these and other factors in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer can be illustrated by a Korean series of 213 patients with advanced biliary tract cancer who were either enrolled in one of two prospective phase II studies or included in a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving first-line chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In multivariate analysis, metastatic disease, intrahepatic primary site, the presence of liver metastases, poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>), and elevated level of serum alkaline phosphatase were significant predictors of overall survival. Using these five variables, the authors developed a prognostic index to stratify patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups with different median (11.5, 7.3, and 3.6 months, respectively) and one-year survivals (48, 26, and 4 percent, respectively).</p><p>Although these results are not surprising, they demonstrate the variability of clinical presentation and outcomes among patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. The broad spectrum of clinical course and range of prognostic factors must be kept in mind when assessing the results of investigational studies of new treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H269655511\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few prospective trials have been undertaken of first-line chemotherapy in advanced biliary tract cancer. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> has been shown to be superior to gemcitabine alone, but this regimen has not been compared head to head with other gemcitabine-based combinations with the sole exception of gemcitabine plus S-1. (See <a href=\"#H269656209\" class=\"local\">'Gemcitabine plus cisplatin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer that patients enroll in clinical trials, whenever possible. If a patient is not a candidate for a clinical trial or if one is not available, and S-1 is not available, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> for a first-line regimen for patients with a good performance status.
