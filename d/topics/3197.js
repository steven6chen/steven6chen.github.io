Due to the widespread use of MRI and rising clinical awareness, CVT is recognized with increasing frequency. In addition, it is now known to have a more varied clinical spectrum than previously realized. Because of its myriad causes and presentations, CVT is a disease that may be encountered not only by neurologists and neurosurgeons, but also by emergency clinicians, internists, oncologists, hematologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, and family practitioners.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of CVT. Prognosis and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CVT in newborns is also reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke in the newborn: Classification, manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available data suggest that CVT is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The annual incidence ranges from 0.22 to 1.57 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>], and is more common in women than men, with a female to male ratio of 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The imbalance may be due to the increased risk of CVT associated with pregnancy and puerperium and with oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3408172362\" class=\"local\">'Acquired thrombophilia'</a> below.)</p><p>In adults, CVT affects patients who are younger on average than those with arterial types of stroke. In the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT), the mean age of patients with CVT was 39 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and only 8 percent of the patients were older than 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of CVT remains incompletely understood because of the high variability in the anatomy of the venous system, and the paucity of experiments in animal models of CVT. However, there are at least two different mechanisms that may contribute to the clinical features of CVT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80911 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis of cerebral veins or dural sinus obstructs blood drainage from brain tissue, leading to cerebral parenchymal lesions or dysfunction, and to increased venous and capillary pressure with disruption of the blood-brain barrier.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusion of dural sinus resulting in decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption and elevated intracranial pressure.</p><p/><p>Obstruction of the venous structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72961\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72961 \">figure 2</a>) results in increased venous pressure, decreased capillary perfusion pressure, and increased cerebral blood volume. Dilatation of cerebral veins and recruitment of collateral pathways play an important role in the early phases of CVT and may initially compensate for changes in pressure.</p><p>The increase in venous and capillary pressure leads to blood-brain barrier disruption, causing vasogenic edema, with leakage of blood plasma into the interstitial space. As intravenous pressure continues to increase, mild parenchymal changes, severe cerebral edema, and venous hemorrhage may occur due to venous or capillary rupture. The increased intravenous pressure may lead to an increase in intravascular pressure and a lowering of cerebral perfusion pressure, resulting in decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and failure of energy metabolism. In turn, this allows intracellular entry of water from failure of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Na+/K+</span> ATPase pump, and consequent cytotoxic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of venous occlusion have been aided by the use of MRI methods, mainly diffusion-weighted MRI and perfusion-weighted MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. These techniques have demonstrated the coexistence of both cytotoxic and vasogenic edema in patients with CVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>].</p><p>The other effect of venous thrombosis is impairment of CSF absorption. Normally, CSF absorption occurs in the arachnoid granulations, which drain CSF into the superior sagittal sinus. Thrombosis of the dural sinuses leads to increased venous pressure, impaired CSF absorption, and consequently elevated intracranial pressure. Elevated intracranial pressure is more frequent if superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is present, but it may also occur with thrombosis of the jugular sinus or the lateral sinus. Note that the lateral sinus consists of two segments; the proximal segment is termed the transverse sinus, and the distal segment is termed the sigmoid sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72961\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72961 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many conditions are associated with CVT.

In the Canadian pediatric ischemic stroke registry, a risk factor was identified in 98 percent of the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A prothrombotic state was found in 41 percent. In infants older than four weeks of age and in children, head and neck disorders, mostly infections and chronic systemic diseases (eg, connective tissue disease, hematologic disorder, and cancer) were common. The most common risk factors in those &ge;65 years old are genetic or acquired thrombophilia, malignancy, and hematologic disorders such as polycythemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3408172362\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired thrombophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common acquired thrombophilias are pregnancy and the puerperium, the use of oral contraceptives, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Compared with men, women were significantly younger (mean age 34 years, versus 42 years for men). Furthermore, a gender-specific risk factor (ie, oral contraceptives, pregnancy, puerperium, and hormone replacement therapy) was identified in 65 percent of women. In an earlier report of the ISCVT cohort, a prothrombotic condition was found in 34 percent of all patients, and a genetic prothrombotic condition was found in 22 percent of all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The most frequent risk factor for CVT in young women is the use of oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Furthermore, the risk for CVT in women using oral contraceptives is increased if they have a prothrombotic defect and if they are obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1153560484\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic thrombophilia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk for CVT is influenced by the individual's genetic background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The clear demonstration of absence of flow and intraluminal venous thrombus by CT or MRI is the most important finding for confirming the diagnosis.

Nevertheless, lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with large brain lesions because they have an increased risk of herniation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for thrombophilic state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Searching for a thrombophilic state, either genetic or acquired, should be done for patients with CVT who have a high pretest probability of severe thrombophilia, a category that includes those with a personal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family history of venous thrombosis, CVT at a young age, and CVT in the absence of a transient or permanent risk factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65303 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

In practice, it is preferable to test for protein C, protein S, and antithrombin at least two weeks after oral anticoagulation has been discontinued, since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy reduces measurements of protein C and protein S, and may raise plasma antithrombin concentrations into the normal range in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency. It is possible to test for protein C and protein S levels while receiving heparin therapy, which does not alter plasma protein C or protein S concentrations. However, testing for antithrombin should be performed when off heparin, which can lower antithrombin levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-s-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein S deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>No underlying etiology or risk factor for CVT is found in approximately 13 percent of adult patients. However, it is important to continue searching for a cause even after the acute phase of CVT, as some patients may have a condition such as the antiphospholipid syndrome, polycythemia, thrombocythemia, malignancy, or inflammatory bowel disease that is discovered weeks or months after the acute phase. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and causes'</a> above.)</p><p>If abnormal results are found in assays for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, or anti-beta2 glycoprotein-I antibodies, testing should be repeated at least 12 weeks later, as the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome requires two positive determinations of these biomarkers.

Among young adults, CVT is more common in women than men. The mean age of onset is 39 years old. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major risk factors for CVT in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65303 \">table 1</a>) are prothrombotic (hypercoagulable) conditions , oral contraceptives, pregnancy and the puerperium, malignancy, infection, head injury, and mechanical precipitants. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of CVT is highly variable. The onset can be acute, subacute, or chronic. Headache (of gradual, acute, or thunderclap onset) is the most frequent symptom, occurring in almost 90 percent of patients, and may occur as part of an isolated intracranial hypertension syndrome, with or without vomiting, papilledema, and visual problems. In other cases, headache may be accompanied by focal neurologic deficits, focal or generalized seizures, and encephalopathy with altered mental status or coma. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical aspects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal brain lesions, including brain swelling, edema, venous infarction, or hemorrhagic venous infarction, may occur secondary to venous occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of an abnormal signal in a venous sinus on brain MRI and the corresponding absence of flow on magnetic resonance (MR) venography confirms the diagnosis of CVT. However, these findings are not always evident, and the diagnosis may rest on imaging features showing only absence of flow in a venous sinus or cortical vein. Other than neuroimaging, there is no simple confirmatory laboratory test that can confidently rule out CVT in the acute phase of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain MRI in combination with MR venography is the most informative technique for demonstrating the presence of dural thrombus, cortical vein thrombosis, and extent of brain injury. (See <a href=\"#H1549960544\" class=\"local\">'MRI'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2815901636\" class=\"local\">'MR venography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head CT scan is normal in up to 30 percent of CVT cases, and most of the findings with CVT are nonspecific. However, in about one-third of patients, CT demonstrates direct signs of CVT, which are the empty delta sign, the cord sign, and the dense triangle sign. CT venography is a useful alternative to MR venography. (See <a href=\"#H1532994662\" class=\"local\">'CT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2510402274\" class=\"local\">'CT venography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for thrombophilia should be done for patients with CVT who have a high pretest probability for severe thrombophilia, a category that includes those with a personal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family history of venous thrombosis, CVT at a young age, and CVT in the absence of a transient or permanent risk factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65303 \">table 1</a>).
