The normal homeostatic mechanisms that maintain the effective circulating volume and plasma osmolality are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the kidneys can adjust to wide variations in dietary intake by appropriate variations in water and electrolyte excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which is particularly important when discussing maintenance fluid requirements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Water balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water losses lead to an increase in serum sodium and osmolality, resulting in stimulation of thirst and increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In normal individuals, these changes will lead to increased water intake and reduced water excretion, which will restore normal water balance. Thus, patients who are alert, have an intact thirst mechanism, and access to water will not become hypernatremic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On a normal diet, the minimum water intake is estimated at 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> (assuming there are no increased losses). This value is based upon the balance of total water intake and production and the minimum rate of urinary loss. Individuals who can concentrate their urine to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L</span> who excrete 600 mosmol of solute (sodium and potassium salts and urea) per day will have a minimum urine output of 500 mL (600 mosmol &divide; 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L)</span>.</p><p>There are two other sources of water in addition to fluid ingestion: the water content of food (fruits and vegetables are almost 100 percent water by weight) and the water generated by oxidation of carbohydrates. There are also other sources of water loss in addition to the urine output: insensible losses and sweat.</p><p>Normal adults are considered to have a minimal obligatory water intake or generation of approximately 1600 mL per day, composed of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingested water &ndash; 500 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water in food &ndash; 800 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water from oxidation &ndash; 300 mL</p><p/><p>The sources of obligatory water output in normal adults are composed of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine &ndash; 500 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; 500 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory tract &ndash; 400 mL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool &ndash; 200 mL</p><p/><p>However, the water of oxidation and much of the water lost from the lungs during respiration are linked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The metabolic production of CO2 and water occur in a 1:1 proportion during the oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids and, if the arterial pCO2 is close to 40 mmHg, these two end-products are eliminated together in alveolar air in a 1:1 proportion. Water and CO2 are eliminated in parallel because the partial pressures of water vapor (47 mmHg) and CO2 (40 mmHg) are virtually equal in alveolar air, and because both CO2 and water are nearly absent in inspired air.</p><p>Thus, the water of oxidation and most of the water normally lost from the lungs during respiration can probably be removed from estimates of water balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In most patients, only the small amount of water evaporation from the upper respiratory tract results in a negative water balance. This does not apply to patients who are hyperventilating (which increases alveolar water losses) or are on a ventilator and inspiring humidified air warmed to body temperature (which decreases alveolar water losses).</p><p>Evaporation of water from the skin as sweat (which usually has a sodium concentration of 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> and is therefore mostly water) is required to dissipate heat. When additional heat loss is needed, there is an increase in evaporative water losses from the skin. On the other hand, these losses diminish during fasting and inactivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sodium balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sodium intake and urinary sodium excretion are closely balanced. On a normal Western diet, the 100 to 250 mEq of sodium that are taken in are excreted in the urine. However, the kidney can excrete urine that is virtually free of sodium. As an example, in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available, most patients maintained sodium balance on the Kempner rice diet, which contained less than 10 mEq of sodium per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two components to fluid therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy replaces the ongoing losses of water and electrolytes under normal physiologic conditions via urine, sweat, respiration, and stool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replacement therapy corrects any existing water and electrolyte deficits. These deficits can result from gastrointestinal, urinary, or skin losses, bleeding, and third-space sequestration.</p><p/><p>Maintenance fluid therapy and replacement of mild fluid deficits will be reviewed here. The following discussion generally applies to patients with normal kidney function (and normal concentrating and diluting ability) and no underlying severe cardiac or hepatic dysfunction. Fluid and electrolyte balance are clearly different in patients with severe renal disease or an edematous state. The treatment of severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE FLUID THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the presence of normal or near-normal kidney function, maintenance fluid therapy is usually undertaken when the patient is not expected to be able to eat or drink normally for a prolonged period of time (eg, perioperatively or on a ventilator). The goal of maintenance fluid therapy is to preserve water and electrolyte balance and to provide nutrition. Patients expected to have inadequate energy or fluid intake for more than one to two weeks should be considered for parenteral or enteral nutrition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The serum sodium concentration provides the best estimate of water balance in relation to solute. A normal serum sodium concentration implies that the patient is in water balance in relation to sodium but does not provide any information on volume status. Weighing the patient daily provides the best means for estimating net gain or loss of fluid since gastrointestinal, urine, and insensible losses in hospitalized patients are unpredictable and difficult to monitor.</p><p>The patient should also be monitored for clinical signs of either volume excess (edema) or volume depletion (eg, reduced skin turgor, fall in blood pressure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Water</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalized patients who are afebrile, not eating, and physically inactive require less than one liter of electrolyte (sodium and potassium)-free water as maintenance fluid. Maintenance water requirements can be increased or decreased by a number of factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased water intake is required if the patient has fever, sweating, burns, tachypnea, surgical drains, polyuria, or ongoing significant gastrointestinal losses. As an example, water requirements increase by 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> for each degree of body temperature elevation over 37&ordm;C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased water intake is required in a number of clinical settings, including oliguric renal failure, the use of humidified air, edematous states, and hypothyroidism. In addition, sick patients may be unable to excrete excess water due to the presence of nonosmotic stimuli for the release of antidiuretic hormone (ie, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>As mentioned above, the adequacy of water balance, as opposed to the adequacy of volume balance, is determined solely from the serum sodium concentration. A normal value means that the body has the proper amount of water for the amount of sodium but provides no information on volume balance. Because water deficits do not develop very rapidly in patients who do not have accelerated water losses, adjustment of the water prescription based upon frequent measurements of the serum sodium concentration is a logical strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrolytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of electrolyte losses (primarily sodium and potassium salts) are in the urine, with a lesser contribution from the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Electrolyte balance can be maintained over a wide range of intakes due to appropriate changes in urinary electrolyte excretion. If, for example, there is an increase in sodium intake, the ensuing increase in extracellular fluid volume will reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and increase the release of natriuretic peptides, resulting in an appropriate increase in sodium excretion.</p><p>Since the maintenance requirement for electrolyte-free water intake is less than one liter per day, a reasonable approach is to begin with two liters per day of one-half isotonic saline in 5 percent dextrose to which 20 mEq (ie, 20 mmol) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> is added per liter. This regimen provides 9 g of sodium chloride (3.4 g of sodium), which is similar to the sodium content of a hospital diet. The presence of dextrose in the solution does not alter its tonicity, and infusion of two liters of the dextrose-containing solution provides 400 kilocalories, enough to suppress catabolism. Patients with gastrointestinal or third-space losses may require a higher rate of saline (or blood) administration to maintain volume balance.</p><p>The original solution can be continued unless one of the following occurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum sodium starts to fall, a more concentrated solution should be given (eg, isotonic saline in 5 percent dextrose)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum sodium starts to rise due, for example, to increased insensible losses from high fever, a more dilute solution should be given (eg, one-quarter isotonic saline in 5 percent dextrose)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum potassium starts to fall, more potassium should be added and, should it rise above normal, potassium should be eliminated</p><p/><p>In patients with normal or near-normal renal function, hyperkalemia is a rare problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">REPLACEMENT FLUID THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of replacement therapy is to correct existing abnormalities in volume status <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum electrolytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume deficit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no formula that can be used to accurately estimate the total fluid deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If pre- and post-deficit body weight is known, then weight loss provides a reasonable estimate of fluid losses. If the degree of weight loss is not known, then the fluid deficit cannot be estimated. Clinical and laboratory parameters can be used to assess the possible presence of volume depletion, including the blood pressure, jugular venous pressure, urine sodium concentration, urine output, and, if baseline values are available and bleeding has not occurred, the hematocrit.</p><p>These parameters should be followed to assess the efficacy of volume replacement. If, for example, the urine sodium concentration remains below 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> then the kidney is sensing persistent volume depletion and more fluid should be given. Use of the urine sodium concentration does <strong>not</strong> apply to edematous patients with heart failure or cirrhosis in whom the urine sodium concentration is a marker of effective circulating volume depletion but not of the need for more fluid or more salt. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Renal sodium retention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate of replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of correction of volume depletion depends upon its severity. With severe volume depletion or hypovolemic shock, at least 1 to 2 liters of isotonic saline are generally given as rapidly as possible in an attempt to restore tissue perfusion, Fluid replacement is continued at a rapid rate until the clinical signs of hypovolemia improve (eg, low blood pressure, low urine output, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired mental status). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Rate of fluid repletion'</a>.)</p><p>In comparison, rapid fluid resuscitation is not necessary in patients with mild to moderate hypovolemia. To avoid worsening of the volume deficit, the rate of fluid administration must be greater than the rate of continued fluid losses, which is equal to the urine output plus estimated insensible losses (usually 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span> plus any other fluid losses (eg, gastrointestinal losses) that may be present. One regimen that we have used to induce positive fluid balance in such patients is the administration of fluid at a rate that is 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> greater than estimated fluid losses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of replacement fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The composition of fluid that is given is largely dependent upon the type of fluid that has been lost and any concurrent electrolyte disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most patients are treated with isotonic or one-half isotonic saline but the choice of therapy can be influenced by concurrent abnormalities in serum sodium or potassium or the presence of metabolic acidosis.</p><p>As examples, hypotonic solutions should be used in hypernatremia, isotonic or hypertonic saline should be used in hyponatremia, and isotonic saline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood should be used in patients with blood loss. Potassium or bicarbonate may need to be added in patients with hypokalemia or metabolic acidosis.</p><p>Choosing a replacement fluid in patients with severe volume depletion, including a discussion about the use of crystalloid versus colloid, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Choice of replacement fluid'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypernatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water deficits resulting in hypernatremia should generally be corrected <strong>slowly</strong> since overly rapid correction of chronic hypernatremia is potentially harmful, and water deficits usually develop gradually. If, however, it is known that the water deficit developed in less than 48 hours, hypernatremia can and should be corrected rapidly. The preferred rate of correction and the supportive data are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;, section on 'Choosing a rate of correction'</a>.)</p><p>Fluid therapy can be planned by calculating how much dilute fluid (eg, 5 percent dextrose in water) should be given to lower the sodium at the desired rate. Dextrose in water can be given alone in patients with diabetes insipidus who have lost only water, but will not correct all of the hypovolemia if there has also been salt and water loss due, for example, to concurrent diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;, section on 'Estimating the water deficit'</a>.)</p><p>Sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium can be added to the intravenous fluid as necessary to treat concurrent volume depletion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypokalemia (due, for example, to diarrhea). However, the addition of sodium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium decreases the amount of free water that is being given. If, for example, one-quarter isotonic saline is infused, then only three-quarters of the solution is free water. In this setting, approximately 1333 mL of isotonic saline must be given to provide 1000 mL of free water. If potassium is also added to the intravenous fluid, then even less free water is present and a further adjustment to the rate of infusion must be made. These adjustments are only estimates that are then guided by serial monitoring of the serum sodium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with hypernatremia, overly rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially harmful if there has been time for adaptation to the electrolyte disturbance (greater than 48 hours). The administration of isotonic saline in hyponatremic patients will initially tend to raise the serum sodium since it has a higher sodium concentration than the serum. </p><p>If the cause of hyponatremia is a hypovolemic stimulus to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, then once the volume deficit is largely repaired, the stimulus to ADH secretion will be removed. This will result in the excretion of a maximally dilute urine and possible overly rapid correction of the hyponatremia that can lead to severe neurologic dysfunction. </p><p>On the other hand, if the cause of hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), the urine will remain concentrated and the sodium contained in the intravenous isotonic fluid will be excreted in the urine at a higher concentration than in the infused intravenous fluid. This &quot;desalination&quot; phenomenon will result in a net gain of electrolyte-free water that may cause the serum sodium to fall during the infusion of isotonic saline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Addition of potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concurrent potassium replacement is indicated in patients who have developed potassium depletion as typically manifested by hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are also settings in which potassium depletion is present but the serum potassium is normal or even increased. A classic example is diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemia in which both hyperosmolality and insulin deficiency promote potassium movement out of the cells, masking the presence of potassium depletion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Serum potassium'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, the serum potassium may be low in the absence of potassium depletion, as may be seen in patients with thyrotoxic or familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis; potassium replacement in such patients can lead to hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Potassium is as osmotically active as sodium. Thus, the addition of 40 mEq (ie, 40 mmol) of potassium to one liter of one-half isotonic saline (containing 77 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of sodium [ie, 77 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> creates a solution that is essentially three-quarters isotonic saline and therefore contains less free water. This could be important in patients with an elevated plasma osmolality due to hypernatremia or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment#H10738776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Potassium replacement'</a>.)</p><p>If potassium is added to isotonic saline or one-half isotonic saline, it limits the potential rate of infusion. In most cases, the desired rate of potassium replacement is no greater than 10 mEq per hour; in patients with life-threatening hypokalemia, the rate can be increased to 20 mEq per hour, although electrocardiographic monitoring is required. Thus, if 40 mEq or potassium has been added to a liter of intravenous (IV) solution, the rate of infusion should generally be limited to 250 mL per hour, or 500 mL per hour with electrocardiographic monitoring if the patient has life-threatening hypokalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Addition of bicarbonate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A more complex solution may be required in patients with metabolic acidosis. In this setting, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> may be added, particularly if the acidemia is severe (arterial pH less than 7.15 to 7.2 or less than 7 in diabetic ketoacidosis) or bicarbonate losses persist (as with severe diarrhea). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Bicarbonate and metabolic acidosis'</a>.)</p><p>Suppose a patient with diarrhea presents with mild hypernatremia, mild hypokalemia, and a serum bicarbonate concentration of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. An appropriate dilute replacement fluid in this setting might be one-quarter isotonic saline in 5 percent dextrose (containing 38.5 mEq of sodium chloride) to which 20 mEq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> and 25 mEq (one-half ampule) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> have been added. The total cation concentration is 83.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> roughly equivalent to one-half isotonic saline. It is important to add potassium to the intravenous fluid in hypokalemic patients since both the administration of bicarbonate and increased insulin secretion induced by dextrose will tend to drive potassium into the cells, which will further reduce the serum potassium concentration.</p><p>An alternative regimen that can be used in patients with metabolic acidosis without hypokalemia is the addition of three ampules of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> (each containing 50 mEq of sodium and 50 mL of water) to one liter of 5 percent dextrose in water, which results in a nearly isotonic solution with a sodium concentration of approximately 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. In contrast, addition of the same three ampules of sodium bicarbonate to one-liter of half isotonic saline (containing 77 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of sodium) results in a hypertonic solution with a sodium concentration of 197 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> which will tend to raise the serum sodium concentration. Such a solution should not be used unless the patient is hyponatremic (such as in a patient with short bowel syndrome who has mild hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SALINE ALONE OR WITH DEXTROSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence that a dextrose-saline solution has any benefit or harm compared to a saline solution alone for most patients. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dextrose-containing solutions <strong>should be used</strong> in patients with hypoglycemia or alcohol or fasting ketoacidosis and should be given with insulin in patients with hyperkalemia and no hyperglycemia since insulin-mediated entry of potassium into cells will lower the serum potassium concentration.

With respect to hypokalemia, the administration of dextrose stimulates the release of insulin, which promotes potassium entry into cells with possible worsening of the hypokalemia.

Requirements are increased if there are increased fluid losses as with fever, surgical drains, or ongoing significant gastrointestinal losses. Water requirements are decreased by oliguric renal failure, the use of humidified air, edematous states, hypothyroidism, and the presence of nonosmotic stimuli for the release of antidiuretic hormone (ie, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance fluid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require maintenance fluid and have normal or near-normal renal function and are otherwise stable, we suggest beginning with two liters per day of one-half isotonic saline in 5 percent dextrose to which 20 mEq (ie, 20 mmol) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> is added per liter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Replacement fluid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The total fluid deficit can be estimated from pre- and post-deficit body weight. If the degree of weight loss is not known, then the fluid deficit cannot be estimated. Clinical and laboratory parameters can be used to assess the possible presence of volume depletion, including the blood pressure and urine sodium concentration. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Volume deficit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of correction of volume depletion depends upon its severity. For patients with severe volume depletion or hypovolemic shock, we recommend administration of 1 to 2 liters of isotonic saline as rapidly as possible in an attempt to restore tissue perfusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Fluid replacement is continued at a rapid rate until the clinical signs of hypovolemia improve (eg, low blood pressure, low urine output, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired mental status). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Rate of replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A less rapid rate of correction should be used in patients with mild to moderate hypovolemia. In such cases, the rate of fluid administration must be greater than the rate of continued fluid losses, which is equal to the urine output plus estimated insensible losses (usually 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span> plus any other fluid losses (eg, gastrointestinal losses) that may be present. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Rate of replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of replacement fluid is dependent upon the type of fluid that has been lost and any concurrent electrolyte disorders. Most patients are initially treated with isotonic or one-half isotonic saline. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Choice of replacement fluid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypernatremia and hyponatremia should usually be corrected slowly since overly rapid correction is potentially harmful. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hypernatremia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium replacement is indicated in patients with potassium depletion. This is typically manifested by hypokalemia, but may occur in the setting of a normal or even increased serum potassium in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Addition of potassium'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Serum potassium'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> may be required in patients with metabolic acidosis if the acidemia is severe (arterial pH less than 7.2) or bicarbonate losses persist (as with severe diarrhea).
