Genital herpes is usually secondary to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2); the remainder of infections is related to HSV-1, which also causes herpes labialis (&quot;cold sores&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-type-2-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The seroprevalence of HSV-2 infections in HIV-infected patients is high (50 to 90 percent) and genital ulcer disease can be more frequent, severe, and of longer duration than in HIV-seronegative patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-type-2-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the treatment of genital herpes in HIV-infected patients.

Because efficacy appears to be similar among these antiviral agents, selection of any one (eg, acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir) should be driven mainly by cost, formulary considerations, and frequency of dosing for patient convenience.
