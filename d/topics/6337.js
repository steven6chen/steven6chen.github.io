This classification system has been revised since its origination in 1981, most recently in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

That being said, as an increasing number of genetic mutations have been identified in patients with both inherited and seemingly sporadic epilepsy syndromes, it has become clear that the phenotypic spectrum of various syndromes may be broader than what has been traditionally recognized, and the classification systems will continue to evolve.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of some of the more common epilepsy syndromes that begin in infancy and childhood.

Such syndromes are characterized by multiple febrile seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and other seizure types including absences, myoclonic seizures, and even focal seizures.

Myoclonus is a brief synchronous jerk of one or more limbs with and without involvement of the bulbar musculature. Jerks may be focal, multifocal, or generalized and are more likely to be flexor than extensor. There can also be negative myoclonus, in which there is inhibition of muscular activity that can be detected reliably by means of surface electromyography (EMG). Myoclonus is termed epileptic when it occurs in association with a synchronous cortical epileptiform discharge, usually a generalized spike-and-wave discharge, or isolated spikes or sharp waves over the motor cortex (the latter may have to be identified by special computer averaging techniques). Epileptic myoclonus must be distinguished from other epileptic and non-epileptic conditions, including infantile spasms, tonic seizures, normal physiologic sleep myoclonus (hypnic jerks), and benign startle responses, among others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myoclonic seizures in infants can be accompanied by other seizure types, including partial and generalized convulsive seizures. These epileptic syndromes have been divided into a benign and severe form based upon the clinical course, with the latter manifesting psychomotor retardation, severe speech delay, and often ataxia. Some discussion has occurred in the neurologic literature questioning the justification of subdividing the myoclonic epilepsies into individual syndromes rather than considering them as a spectrum from benign to very severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This latter approach seems more rational because there are problems inherent with classifying epilepsies on the basis of subsequent neurodevelopmental outcomes, which are not known at the time of presentation and can be the result of competing causes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864548\"><span class=\"h3\">Dravet syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dravet syndrome (DS), previously known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a rare early-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterized by refractory epilepsy and neurodevelopmental problems beginning in infancy.

In most patients, febrile and afebrile seizures, including episodes of status epilepticus, recur repeatedly in the weeks to months after the initial event, and psychomotor impairment begins shortly thereafter. Myoclonus, both epileptic and non-epileptic, occurs frequently. The majority of older children and young adults with DS have motor system dysfunction, gait and postural abnormalities, and cognitive and behavioral impairment. &#160;</p><p>Seizures tend to be refractory to antiseizure drugs, and some patients derive benefit from nonpharmacologic therapies such as the ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation.

Patients usually present before eight years of age, most commonly between three and five years of age.

The syndrome is characterized by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple seizure types, particularly tonic and atypical absence seizures, but also atonic and myoclonic seizures. Periods of nonconvulsive status epilepticus occur in most cases at some stage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A slow (less than 2.5 Hertz) spike-wave pattern on the interictal EEG that is generalized and usually has highest amplitude in the frontal region (also called an &quot;atypical spike and wave&quot; pattern). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental retardation (occasionally progressive) with or without other neurologic abnormalities.

Most children with the characteristic slow spike and wave EEG pattern have a static encephalopathy and mental retardation. The EEG pattern associated with the tonic seizures is similar to the ictal pattern of an infantile spasm, with an electrodecremental response with or without generalized fast activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-infantile-spasms#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of infantile spasms&quot;, section on 'Ictal EEG'</a>.)</p><p>This syndrome has many causes, including genetic disorders, neurocutaneous syndromes (eg, tuberous sclerosis), encephalopathies following hypoxic-ischemic insults, meningitis, and head injuries. Approximately 40 percent of patients have an unknown etiology, although these children are increasingly found to have genetic disorders, particularly chromosomal syndromes or de novo mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Up to 25 percent of children with LGS have a history of infantile spasms. Children with this syndrome are often difficult to manage medically and have a poor seizure and neurologic prognosis. Mortality is also high (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients without an identifiable cause usually have a somewhat milder phenotype and less profound functional and neurologic impairment in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal therapy for LGS is uncertain and may depend in part upon the underlying etiology. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials have concluded that no drug has been shown to be highly effective, although valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rufinamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rufinamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felbamate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">felbamate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobazam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clobazam</a> may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a> can precipitate drop attacks in some of these children. </p><p>Two randomized studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobazam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clobazam</a> may be an effective treatment in children with LGS. In one trial, 217 patients with LGS were randomized to one of four treatment arms: placebo or clobazam 0.25, 0.5, or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. After 12 weeks, a &gt;50 percent reduction in drop seizures was observed in 32, 43, 59, and 78 percent of patients in each respective treatment group, demonstrating a dose-response effect; the differences were statistically significant for the two higher clobazam dose groups versus placebo. In another trial, high-dose clobazam (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) was associated with a greater number of patients achieving a &gt;50 percent reduction in drop seizures compared to low-dose clobazam (0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) (83 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Clobazam is now available in the US.</p><p>Because seizures are often medically refractory, other treatment options are often considered. The ketogenic diet has been helpful in some children with LGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Vagus nerve stimulation also appears to be effective in some patients with LGS, leading to a greater than 50 percent reduction in seizure frequency (particularly for atonic and tonic seizures), as well as shortened seizure duration and reduced number of antiseizure drugs prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

Other surgical options, including corpus callosotomy or lesional epilepsy surgery in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma, may be considered in some refractory cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Two key characteristics define this population of patients: marked sleep potentiation of epileptiform activity in the transition from wakefulness to sleep that leads to an EEG pattern of continuous or near-continuous spikes and waves during non-REM sleep, and a regression in different aspects of development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Although terminology is not applied consistently, most use LKS to refer to the epileptic encephalopathy associated with predominant language regression, CSWS to refer to the more severe epilepsy syndrome associated with global developmental regression, and ESES to refer to the EEG pattern of continuous or near-continuous spike-and-wave during sleep that can be associated with a variety of clinical presentations. Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also known as benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood, is considered by many to lie on the most benign end of this spectrum and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;, section on 'Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes'</a>.)</p><p>The underlying etiology of disorders in this spectrum is unknown in most cases, although genetic causes may be increasingly recognized in both sporadic and familial cases. As an example, mutations in <em>GRIN2A</em>, a gene that encodes the alpha-2 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-selective glutamate receptor, were identified in 10 families with a spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from atypical rolandic epilepsy to LKS and CSWS, and in an additional eight subjects without a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In other series, <em>GRIN2A</em> mutations were identified in 12 of 245 individuals (5 percent) with BECTS, 9 of 51 individuals (18 percent) with CSWS, and 4 of 44 cases (9 percent) of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes ranging from BECTS to CSWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Affected patients have a distinct speech phenotype, with prominent dysarthria and dyspraxia, which may have a lifelong impact on speech intelligibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>In addition, early developmental lesions such as cortical malformations (eg, polymicrogyria) or vascular insults have been described in 40 to 60 percent of patients with CSWS but are rare in LKS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H859723\"><span class=\"h2\">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LKS represents one of the best examples of deterioration of higher cortical functioning, in this case language, solely on the basis of frequent epileptiform activity. </p><p>Children with LKS develop normally until approximately three to six years of age, when they begin to lose language function. This later age of onset is in contrast with that of children with autism. The disorder begins with an auditory verbal agnosia; the children behave as if they are deaf. They ultimately have difficulties with expressive language and many have personality disorders and hyperkinetic behavior. They do not develop the striking behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorders, and usually they do not manifest a decline of overall cognitive function. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Relationship with autism'</a> below.)</p><p>Approximately 75 percent of children with LKS have clinical seizures, but these are rarely severe. The electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities are quite dramatic and are required to make the diagnosis. The typical findings are bilateral centrotemporal spikes and sharp waves with fields that spread widely throughout both hemispheres. The diffuse spread of this bihemispheric focal activity often leads to the appearance of &quot;generalized spike and wave&quot; discharges. When the child falls asleep, the epileptiform activity becomes virtually continuous and is classified as electrical status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). To be considered ESES, more than 85 percent of non-REM sleep should be occupied by continuous epileptiform activity, although an exact cutoff is not specified in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria, and some authors use lower thresholds (eg, more than 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>With sophisticated imaging and nuclear medicine techniques, the epileptiform process can be shown to originate in the language cortex of the dominant temporal lobe and secondarily to spread to homologous cortex in the other hemisphere and beyond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. No structural abnormalities are typically seen on routine neuroimaging with CT or MRI. However, volumetric analysis of MRI in four children with typical LKS has shown volume reductions of 26 to 51 percent in the bilateral superior temporal areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], regions that correspond to the auditory association cortex. It is unclear if this focal cortical atrophy is the cause of LKS or the result of intractable epileptiform activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The deterioration of language in these children may be caused by an interruption of the normal maturation of the cortex in the temporal lobes during a critical period of development when the brain is making new synapses and removing (&quot;pruning&quot;) others. The pervasive epileptiform activity is thought to activate and perpetuate synaptic connections that would, in the course of normal development, be removed. There is evidence that cognitive functioning improves if epileptic activity is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The involvement of both temporal lobes eliminates the possibility that an uninvolved temporal lobe can subsume the function of the other as so often occurs in children with lesions that disrupt the dominant speech cortex early in development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H859729\"><span class=\"h2\">Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSWS is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by seizures, developmental regression in at least two domains, and an EEG pattern of ESES. It is a rare condition that makes up less than 1 percent of patients seen in pediatric epilepsy centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The etiology of CSWS is unknown in many cases, but up to half of patients may have a structural cause identified and some may carry causative genetic mutations in <em>GRIN2A</em>. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Syndromes with electrical status epilepticus during sleep'</a> above.)</p><p>As with LKS, children with CSWS exhibit normal or only mildly abnormal development until about two to four years of age, when they begin having seizures. Seizures during the initial stage often occur out of sleep and are typically unilateral clonic or tonic-clonic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Additional seizure types may include atonic and atypical absence seizures, occasionally progressing to nonconvulsive status epilepticus. There is typically a marked increase in the frequency and types of seizures within the first few years after seizure onset. This is accompanied by a severe neurocognitive regression that occurs around five to six years of age in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Unlike LKS, regression is seen across a wide spectrum of domains, including language, behavior, learning, memory, attention, social interactions, motor skills, and global intelligence.</p><p>During wakefulness, the EEG typically shows focal or multifocal spikes. As in LKS, the hallmark EEG feature of CSWS is ESES, characterized by continuous or near-continuous bilateral or occasionally lateralized slow spikes and waves occupying at least 85 percent of non-REM sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no controlled clinical trials that have investigated treatment in LKS or CSWS, and there is significant regional variation in the approach. As with most types of epilepsy, surgical intervention is considered early for lesional cases. Anecdotal evidence suggests that early initiation of antiseizure drugs and control of epileptic activity improves long term prognosis.</p><p>Antiseizure drugs with some reported benefit include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a>, and others; polytherapy is often needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/58,59,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59,62</a>]. A trial of corticosteroids is recommended if there is not a rapid response to antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/58,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,63</a>]. High-dose nocturnal benzodiazepines have been reported to reduce epileptiform activity in more than half of patients with CSWS, in some cases accompanied by sustained clinical improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The effectiveness of therapy is measured by the patient&rsquo;s clinical response (ie, control of seizures), improving developmental milestones, and the proportion of spike-wave activity on overnight EEG recordings. </p><p>Some patients with LKS and CSWS may benefit from surgical treatment, but the approach must be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Multiple subpial transection is one such approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Subpial transection consists of closely spaced slicing of the temporal lobe gyri involved in the epileptic process, with interruption of the short cortical-cortical fibers in the white matter immediately under the cortical gray. This limited slice disrupts the epileptic interconnections and stops the epileptiform activity while sparing the thalamocortical fibers that subserve normal cortical function. The results can be quite dramatic, with complete disappearance of the epileptiform activity on the EEG and rapid return of language function. Despite the rather extensive transections undertaken in some patients, few postoperative deficits have been noted. Other surgical approaches in selected patients include lesionectomy, corpus callosotomy, and hemispherectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Despite aggressive treatment, some patients with LKS have persistent, intractable epilepsy, and most patients have residual language dysfunction that diminishes their quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients with CSWS typically have more severe neurocognitive regression and worse long-term neurocognitive outcomes, particularly those with underlying structural causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship with autism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LKS is sometimes considered on the differential diagnosis of pervasive <span class=\"nowrap\">developmental/autistic</span> spectrum disorders, but the relationship is a tenuous one, at best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The two syndromes initially were linked by two clinical similarities: loss of language after a period of relatively normal language acquisition and seizures. Uncontrolled evoked potential studies purportedly have shown abnormalities in the auditory cortex in children with autism even with normal EEGs and have been used to support the contention of temporal lobe dysfunction in this disorder. Scattered reports describe successful steroid therapy in children with LKS as well as in autism, also uncontrolled. Nevertheless, the two disorders are in reality quite different. The child with autism usually has a plateau or loss of language in the second half of the second year of life as compared with an older age in LKS, the EEG almost always is normal early in the course of autism, particularly at the time of language regression (although it may show epileptiform activity in over 20 percent at a later age), and one never sees the striking ESES pattern in autism. The characteristic social, motor, and communication abnormalities of autism are not seen in LKS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">BENIGN FOCAL EPILEPSIES OF CHILDHOOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign focal epilepsies of childhood are epilepsy syndromes that occur in developmentally and neurologically normal children and have a self-limited course, remitting prior to adulthood. The best-described of these syndromes are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) or benign rolandic epilepsy makes up about 10 to 20 percent of all childhood epilepsies and has a mean age of onset between seven and nine years. The most common seizure type is a simple focal seizure with motor symptoms that initially involve the face, often with progression of the motor seizures to other areas of the body (the so-called Jacksonian march). Focal seizures evolving to a bilateral convulsive seizure (also called secondarily generalized seizures) are also common and are often the presenting symptom; the clinician may not be able to elicit a history of focality in such cases. Seizures are more common at night and the characteristic EEG abnormality of centrotemporal spikes is also more prominent in sleep recordings. In most cases, seizures remit within two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign occipital epilepsy of childhood (Gastaut type) produces frequent seizures with prominent visual symptoms (hallucinations, blindness). The mean age of onset is between eight and nine years. EEG reveals occipital spikes that are activated by eye closure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panayiotopoulos syndrome presents at a mean age of less than five years with a distinctive seizure type that has prominently autonomic features, including vomiting and skin pallor. The seizures are usually nocturnal and last more than five minutes. One-third to one-half of episodes last more than 30 minutes. </p><p/><p>These disorders are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863375\"><span class=\"h1\">ABSENCE EPILEPSIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absence seizures (also called petit mal or generalized nonconvulsive seizures) are a common pediatric seizure type associated with a range of generalized epilepsy syndromes. Typical absence seizures consist of brief staring episodes with behavioral arrest that may occur tens to hundreds of times daily. They are associated with generalized 3-Hertz spike-and-slow-wave discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG). Atypical absence seizures have a less clear time of onset and resolution than typical absence seizures, and they are often manifest as less complete periods of activity arrest but with impairment of responsiveness or other behavioral changes. </p><p>Several epilepsy syndromes with markedly different clinical courses and prognoses have absence seizures as the only or most predominant seizure type. The age of onset and clinical phenotypes of the absence epilepsy syndromes are quite variable and often help to define the particular syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64284\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64284 \">figure 1</a>). The clinical expression of absence seizures themselves may differ from one syndrome to the other; as an example, in epilepsy with myoclonic absences (EMA), EEG spikes are followed by prominent myoclonic jerks that may cause the child to fall, whereas in children with the more common childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), the spikes are not associated with myoclonus. </p><p>Although the age of onset, clinical manifestations of the seizures, neurologic status of the children, and prognosis differ among the various syndromes, the EEG patterns are quite similar and the approach to treatment is fundamentally the same, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethosuximide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ethosuximide</a>, valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonazepam</a> considered to be the most effective antiseizure drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-absence-epilepsy#H383785509\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood absence epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The other seizure types that accompany the absences are more specific for the particular syndrome. The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE; also referred to as myoclonic-atonic epilepsy) are more serious epilepsy disorders in which children always have other seizure types, including tonic and atonic seizures, as well as developmental delay or regression in association with the epilepsy.</p><p>The neurologic and cognitive status of the child also varies from syndrome to syndrome. Children with CAE, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and JAE usually are neurologically and cognitively intact. Relatively minor behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive impairments are reported in a minority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>].

Children with EMA fall somewhere in between, with approximately 44 percent having mental retardation prior to the onset of the seizures at 1 to 12 years of age (mean 7 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epilepsy-syndromes-in-children/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Patients typically present with prolonged, often febrile, clonic seizure in the setting of normal cognitive and motor development prior to seizure onset. Mutations in <em>SCN1A</em>, a gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, have been identified in up to 80 percent of patients with this syndrome.

There are many causes, including genetic syndromes and hypoxic ischemic insults. Children usually present in the first seven years of life with a syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types, particularly tonic and atonic seizures, an atypical, slow spike and wave pattern on EEG, and mental retardation, often with psychotic features. The optimal therapy is uncertain; some children benefit with treatment from antiseizure drug therapy.

Characteristic EEG abnormalities include bilateral centrotemporal spikes and sharp waves that spread widely throughout both hemispheres. During sleep, epileptiform activity becomes continuous.
