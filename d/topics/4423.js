This is particularly true when the needs and wishes of the adolescent conflict with the opinions and preferences of the parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The laws governing consent and confidentiality in adolescent health care vary from country to country; within the United States, they vary from state to state. The information in this topic focuses on confidentiality in adolescent health care in the United States.</p><p>Clinicians who treat adolescents must be aware of the federal and state laws related to adolescent consent and confidentiality. The circumstances in which adolescents may consent for their own care and the confidentiality laws vary from state to state depending upon the adolescent's status as a minor or adult, the service involved, and the provider's level of concern regarding harm to the patient or others.</p><p>The basic laws governing consent for health care are state laws; clinicians who treat adolescents need to be aware of the laws in their state. Confidentiality protections are found in both state and federal law. Clinicians who treat adolescents also must be aware that federal and state funding sources may have specific requirements related to confidentiality for particular services. They should be familiar with the consent and confidentiality policies of the facility in which they practice, and they must be aware of potential ways in which confidentiality can be compromised (eg, record keeping, billing statements, insurance).</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of confidentiality in adolescent health care, including definitions, exceptions to confidentiality, and potential threats to confidentiality. Determination of minor status and how it relates to consent for specific medical services, which is closely linked to confidentiality, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of independence from parents is an important task of adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. It includes the gradual assumption of responsibility for personal health, health behaviors, and medical decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/2,3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,6</a>]. Confidentiality protection is essential to this process.</p><p>Adolescents are more likely to seek health care if they believe their provider will keep the information discussed during the visit private [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Concerns regarding lack of confidentiality protection may cause some adolescents to go without health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The importance of confidentiality to adolescents was illustrated in a survey of high school students who were randomly assigned to one of three groups that listened to an audiotape of a clinician assuring unconditional confidentiality (confidentiality would not be violated under any circumstances), conditional confidentiality (confidentiality would be violated if there was risk of harm to the patient or another), or not mentioning confidentiality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Adolescents in the groups that were assured confidentiality reported greater willingness to disclose sensitive information (eg, sexuality, substance use, and mental health) (47 versus 39 percent) and to seek future health care (67 versus 53 percent) than those in the group where confidentiality was not mentioned.</p><p>This information notwithstanding, many health care providers do not routinely discuss confidentiality with adolescent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>]. Although most clinicians support the concept of providing confidential care to adolescents, the level of support may vary depending upon the type of service provided and provider comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIDENTIALITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confidentiality refers to the &quot;privileged and private nature of information provided during the health care transaction&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It should be discussed with the patient and his or her parents or legal guardian at the initial adolescent visit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70738 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/2,6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,15</a>]. It is important to discuss both what will not be divulged by the provider and what must be divulged by the provider (eg, &quot;conditional&quot; versus &quot;unconditional&quot; confidentiality, defined below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Although it is important for clinicians to respect their adolescent patients' privacy and the confidentiality of their patients' information, it is also important to encourage the adolescent, when appropriate, to talk with his or her parents about these personal and sensitive issues that affect health even if doing so may be uncomfortable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3,5,6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6,16</a>]. Parental support can help to ensure that the adolescent's health needs are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In some cases, even partial transparency, if that is all the adolescent allows, can be of benefit; for example, it is helpful for a parent to know if a patient is being given contraception, even if the exact reason for the contraception (contraception versus menstrual control or dysmenorrhea) is not disclosed. A plan for how to discuss the issue with a parent should be developed with the adolescent, in case the parent presses for further details.</p><p>The trust that develops between the provider and adolescent patient surrounding issues of confidentiality can improve adolescent health care and help adolescents view the health care system as a place to which they can go for help throughout their lives. In providing confidential care, it is important to balance the needs of the patient, parents, and provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Providers who are uncomfortable providing confidential care to competent adolescents may choose to refer the adolescent to another provider where confidential services are offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].</p><p>Some state laws give clinicians the option to inform parents their child is seeking services related to sexual health care, substance abuse, or mental health care. In these states, the decision of informing the parents is left to the clinician's discretion and what he or she considers to be in the best interest of the minor or necessary for the minor's health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The discretion may be limited to situations in which disclosure either is necessary to protect the health of the adolescent or will not harm the adolescent. In some cases, family involvement may be essential to the treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. As an example, if an adolescent has not come to critical follow-up appointments pertaining to a confidential health issue, a provider may decide that family involvement is an important tool needed to protect the adolescent's health.</p><p>The decision to violate confidentiality and disclose information should be undertaken after careful consideration and with the intent of beneficence. If the clinician intends to disclose information, he or she should discuss the reasons for disclosure with the patient and allow the patient to participate in the decision of to whom and in what manner the information should be told [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In other cases (eg, seriously dysfunctional parent-child relationships), parental involvement is potentially harmful to the adolescent (eg, places them at risk for being forced out of the home, being forced into unwanted marriage, or physical abuse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These situations highlight the importance of confidentiality pertaining to adolescent health care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Consent for specific services'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Conditional versus unconditional</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that clinicians who care for adolescent patients discuss confidentiality with the patient and his or her parents or guardians at the beginning of the adolescent-provider relationship, explicitly defining the circumstances under which confidentiality is &quot;conditional&quot; or must be broken. Provision of such &quot;conditional&quot; confidentiality is recommended by professional organizations and protected by law [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Exceptions to confidentiality'</a> below.)</p><p>With conditional confidentiality, the clinician assures the patient that everything that is discussed will be kept private except when disclosure is required by law, such as in situations of abuse, suicidal ideation, or homicidal ideation; the patient also must be informed that certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are reportable to public health departments. In addition, many providers add that behaviors representing a serious threat to patient safety may warrant disclosure to parents. As an example, if a patient is drinking a large quantity of alcohol before driving a car on a regular basis and the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> provider determine that immediate change is not possible, this would be a serious threat to both patient safety and the safety of others for which parental help might be enlisted. It is critical to present the conditions in a way that assure the patient that safety and concern are the driving forces, not control and punishment. The following is an example of how to convey conditional confidentiality:</p><p>&quot;I want you to understand that when we talk about things that have to do with sex and drugs and your feelings, it is confidential. This means that what we talk about is just between you and me and that other people, including your parents, will not find out about it unless you want them to know. One exception to this is if I am concerned someone has abused or hurt you. Another exception is if I am concerned you are at serious risk of harm or are planning to or behaving as though you may hurt yourself or someone else. In these situations, I would have to talk to other adults, but I would talk to you first so we could figure out whom we should talk to and the best way to handle it&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians who discuss confidentiality with their adolescent patients promise &quot;unconditional,&quot; rather than &quot;conditional,&quot; confidentiality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A promise of unconditional confidentiality implies that everything that is discussed will be kept private from the parents or anyone else unless the patient wants them to know.</p><p>Although it may not be their intention, clinicians may convey a promise of unconditional confidentiality by not being explicit about the conditions under which confidentiality may be broken; unconditional confidentiality is conveyed in the following example:</p><p>&quot;I want you to understand that when we talk about things that have to do with sex and drugs and your feelings, it is confidential. This means that what we talk about is just between you and me and that other people, including your parents, will not find out about it unless you want them to know&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A promise of unconditional confidentiality is not in accordance with the guidelines set forth by professional organizations, which recommend discussion of conditional confidentiality with the teen and his or her parents. In addition, &quot;unconditional&quot; confidentiality is outside the legal boundaries of confidentiality protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, statements assuring conditional confidentiality may affect the adolescent's willingness to return for future health care. In the survey described above, in which high school students were randomly assigned to listen to an audiotape of a clinician assuring unconditional confidentiality, conditional confidentiality, or not mentioning confidentiality, those who heard the tape assuring unconditional confidentiality reported greater willingness to return for a future visit than those who heard the tape assuring conditional confidentiality (72 versus 62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>One explanation for this finding is that adolescents are unable to distinguish between the confidentiality granted to routine health issues that can be managed solely by the clinician and that granted to serious issues that require outside assistance for management (eg, abuse, suicide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; therefore, any mention of &quot;exceptions&quot; to confidentiality causes the teen to worry that his or her confidentiality will be violated unnecessarily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The provider who understands this can help assuage unnecessary fears by providing a clear explanation of the conditions under which confidentiality will need to be breached.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12770562\"><span class=\"h2\">Public health perspective</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, confidentiality protects the individual patient. From the public health perspective, however, some confidentiality laws that restrict access to data &ndash; especially population-based data, such as immunization registries and other large databases &ndash; may impede research efforts and gains. These laws pertain even when data are de-identified within the database. Thus, a huge epidemiologic resource is lost based solely on the implementation and enforcement of laws that were instituted to protect the very individuals who could benefit from the research conducted on the data. As we move forward with the development of these substantial and valuable databases made possible by the electronic age, the public health community must advocate for a change in the confidentiality policies pertaining to the de-identified data in order to allow for effective public health research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EXCEPTIONS TO CONFIDENTIALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the context of the provider-patient relationship, it is critical that the clinician explain the legal, clinical, and ethical limits of confidentiality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If a parent or other adult is involved in the treatment of an adolescent patient, he or she should be included in this discussion. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Conditional versus unconditional'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to state laws that require reporting of certain events or conditions (eg, child abuse, knife or gunshot wounds, sexually transmitted infections [STIs]), confidentiality may be violated by laws that grant parents explicit access to the minors' complete medical records [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Potential threats to confidentiality'</a> below.) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Child abuse/neglect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians must report known or suspected emotional, sexual, or physical abuse or neglect of a child to appropriate authorities, usually child protective services. Irrefutable proof is not necessary to trigger the reporting requirement, only suspicion. The minor should not be allowed to leave with or return to the parent or guardian if the parent or guardian is suspected of perpetrating the abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and sequelae of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child neglect and emotional maltreatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Consensual sexual activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>State requirements for reporting sexual abuse and sexual activity vary. Every state has laws that require the reporting of sexual abuse and laws that specify when sexual activity of an adult with a minor or between minors is illegal, (sometimes called &quot;statutory rape&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Depending upon the state, consensual sexual activity between two 17-years-olds, two 13-year-olds, or a 14-year-old and a 17-year-old may or may not be considered illegal and may or may not be reportable as child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The laws vary widely in terms of whether consensual sexual activity involving a minor is considered child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. Many state laws consider sexual activity between an adult and a minor to be abuse. These laws assume that all sexual activities involving individuals younger than a certain age are by definition coercive, even if both parties consider the activity to be voluntary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In such states, parents can be reported for abuse or neglect if they are aware of their minor's consensual sexual relationship and assist him or her in obtaining reproductive health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, not all states have adopted this interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The statutes for consensual intercourse typically incorporate the ages of, or difference in age between, the patient and his or her partner(s) and whether the older person is in a position of authority; they also may include specific types of sexual behavior (fondling versus oral-genital contact versus anal or vaginal penetration) and, in some states, sex of the partner (eg, Texas law) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>The requirement to report consensual sexual activity involving minors or &quot;statutory rape&quot; depends upon the state's definition of child abuse; statutory rape is not always a reportable offense. In approximately one-third of states, reporting is mandated only if the sexual activity involving the minor or &quot;statutory rape&quot; was committed or allowed by a person responsible for the care of the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the remaining two-thirds of states, reporting mandates are independent of the relationship between the involved parties. The guidelines for the reporting of sexual activity involving minors or &quot;statutory rape&quot; in individual states are usually found in the section of criminal code dedicated to child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>It is the view of the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine that sexual activity is not synonymous with sexual abuse, that access to confidential health care is essential for adolescents, and that the vast majority of reportable cases of sexual abuse and sexual coercion can be identified through careful clinical assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Factors to be considered in this assessment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the adolescent is in a sexual relationship with a family member, person of authority, or member of the clergy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adolescent's ability to comprehend, make informed decisions about, or consent to sexual activity (eg, whether he or she <span class=\"nowrap\">was/is</span> incapacitated by mental illness, intellectual disability [mental retardation], drugs, alcohol)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the sexual relationship involves violence or coercion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age of the adolescent and the degree to which he or she understands the consequences and responsibilities of sexual activity</p><p/><p>Nonetheless, health care providers have a legal duty to report cases of sexual abuse to the proper authority in accordance with the laws of their state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. This legal duty may be in conflict with their ethical obligation to maintain their patient's confidentiality <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their ability to exercise sound medical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Suicidal ideation or attempt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an adolescent is at risk for harming himself or herself, confidentiality must be breached in deference to the safety of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When a patient reports suicidal ideation, particularly if he or she has a history of suicide attempt, it is critical to keep him or her safe until the suicidal state diminishes or abates. This usually involves working with the family or other supportive individuals who can address safety concerns (eg, remove access to means) and are willing to stay with the child or adolescent at all times. Immediate psychiatric evaluation (through the emergency department or psychiatry crisis clinic) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In such circumstances, the clinician should discuss the need to violate confidentiality with the patient.

These laws are based upon a California Supreme Court decision in a case where a patient told his psychotherapist that he intended to kill a woman and subsequently killed her (Tarasoff versus the Regents of the University of California) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The California Supreme Court determined that when a therapist determines (or should have determined based upon the standards of the profession) that a patient poses a serious danger of violence to an identified victim, the therapist has a duty to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim.</p><p>Many primary care providers feel the same duty to report patient homicidal ideation. In one case where a primary health clinician warned a third party of possible danger, he was sued by his patient but not held liable because the courts thought he had a &quot;legal duty&quot; to inform the potential victim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Violent injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most states, regardless of patient age, clinicians are required to report all gunshot wounds and wounds inflicted by stabbing if the wound appears to have been caused by a criminal act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexually transmitted infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>STIs must be reported to public health departments since they are communicable diseases.

Nonetheless, the confidentiality of adolescent patients may be inadvertently breached through documentation of their health care visits. Many health care providers do not distinguish between information that is confidential &ndash; either based upon legal protections or ethical principles &ndash; and nonconfidential information when they document (ie, they may document confidential health behaviors on the same page as the physical examination without specifying that such information is confidential) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Another is for the provider to distinguish between confidential and nonconfidential information, which makes it easier to redact the confidential portions before the medical record is released to the parent.</p><p>The ability to redact information and to segregate confidential from other information in a medical chart depends upon the policies of a particular institution or practice setting.</p><p>Some states now have laws allowing parents the right to see all medical records unless otherwise indicated by law. One way to manage these &quot;Parent Bill of Rights&quot; statutes is to offer the parent a waiver to this right to obtain areas of the record noted to be confidential in the &quot;consent to treat&quot; form presented at the initial visit.

Under HIPAA, adolescents who are legal adults (18 years and older) and minors who are emancipated or who are considered &quot;individuals&quot; under the regulation can exercise the same rights as other &quot;individuals,&quot; such as access to their medical records, the ability to obtain copies and to request corrections, and the right to authorize disclosure of protected health information. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=consent-in-adolescent-health-care#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Consent in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Emancipated minor'</a>.)</p><p>Minors who are not emancipated have a &quot;personal representative,&quot; usually their parent or guardian, who has the right to make health care decisions for them, and that personal representative has access to their personal health information or records. However, when a minor is considered an individual under the rule, the parent is not automatically the personal representative of the minor. A minor is considered as an &quot;individual&quot; in three specific situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the minor has the right to consent to health care (eg, for treatment of a sexually transmitted infection [STI], request for birth control, treatment for substance abuse) and does consent.

With respect to anyone other than a parent, the minor has the same rights with respect to his or her records as any other adult individual.

If state or other law explicitly requires information to be disclosed to the parent, the provider must do so. If state or other law prohibits disclosure of information to parents without the permission of the minor, the provider must honor that. If a state or other law permits, but does not explicitly require, the disclosure of information, the provider must use his or her own judgment in determining whether disclosure is in the best interest of the patient. If there is no state or other law regarding disclosure, it is again up to the discretion of the provider whether disclosure is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Under the HIPAA privacy regulations, a minor acting as an &quot;individual&quot; may request that providers and health care plans communicate with him or her in a confidential manner (eg, email or personal cell phone).

The HIPAA rule specifies the circumstances under which health care providers and health insurance plans are required to honor such requests. Unfortunately, this request may not always be honored, sometimes because it falls outside the legally required circumstances, sometimes because of oversight, and sometimes because the provider or third-party payer is unaware of this legal provision and has not set up procedures for honoring it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">FERPA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) allows parents access to their unemancipated minor's educational records.

However, if the health records are kept separately as part of a school-based health center, where confidentiality has been addressed, these records cannot be accessed as part of FERPA.
