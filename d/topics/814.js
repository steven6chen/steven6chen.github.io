Angioedema may occur in isolation, accompanied by urticaria, or as a component of anaphylaxis.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of angioedema will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis and causes of angioedema are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioedema typically affects areas with loose connective tissue, such as the face, lips, mouth, and throat, larynx, uvula, extremities, and genitalia. Bowel wall angioedema presents as colicky abdominal pain.</p><p>Angioedema can be distinguished clinically from other forms of edema by the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset in minutes to hours and spontaneous resolution in hours to a few days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric distribution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tendency <strong>not</strong> to involve gravitationally-dependent areas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of face, lips, larynx, and bowels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Association of some forms of angioedema with other signs and symptoms of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of angioedema can be distinguished: mast cell-mediated angioedema and bradykinin-mediated angioedema. However, for many of the known triggers of angioedema, the mechanism is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mast cell-mediated angioedema, such as allergic reactions to foods or insect stings, there are often (not always) other signs and symptoms of mast cell-mediator release. These signs and symptoms include urticaria, flushing, generalized pruritus, bronchospasm, throat tightness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. Patients with additional symptoms affecting organ systems other than the skin may be experiencing anaphylaxis and should be treated immediately with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82831 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 1</a>). Mast cell-mediated angioedema usually begins within minutes of exposure to the allergen, builds over a few hours, and resolves in 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;, section on 'Mast cell-mediated etiologies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema may also be histamine-mediated (histaminergic) without clear evidence of mast cell degranulation. This is typically seen for idiopathic (also known as spontaneous) angioedema. In these cases, angioedema typically occurs alone or with urticaria, but is not accompanied by respiratory or circulatory symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent, idiopathic angioedema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bradykinin-induced angioedema is <strong>not</strong> associated with urticaria, bronchospasm, or other symptoms of allergic reactions. It has a somewhat more prolonged time course, usually developing over 24 to 36 hours and resolving within two to four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. In this type of angioedema, the relationship between the trigger and the onset of symptoms is often not apparent. As an example, in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema, swelling may appear within a week of starting or increasing the medications or after years of use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;, section on 'Bradykinin-mediated etiologies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic sites</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Larynx</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngeal edema can develop rapidly (over minutes) or more slowly over several hours. Early symptoms include hoarse voice, throat tightness, and difficulty swallowing. Assessment and treatment are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Angioedema in or near the airway'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93785986\"><span class=\"h3\">Lips, tongue, and uvula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lips, tongue, and uvula are other structures that can be affected by angioedema and result in airway compromise. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema most commonly presents with swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, although other causes of angioedema affect these structures as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, swelling of the floor of the mouth is more likely to be caused by tumors, infections, or lithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin and mucous membranes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioedema affects the subcutaneous and submucosal tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78006\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78006 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57090\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57090 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68820 \">picture 3</a>). Pruritus is absent, unless the angioedema is associated with urticarial lesions, which are intensely pruritic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66159\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66159 \">picture 4</a>). The skin is either normal in color or mildly erythematous. Mild pain and warmth may be present, but are much less prominent than the pain and warmth of cellulitis. Some patients describe the discomfort of angioedema as burning in nature. Angioedema resolves without leaving residual markings on the skin, unless there has been trauma induced by rubbing or scratching.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Bowel wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioedema affecting the bowel wall presents as colicky abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. Bowel wall edema can often be visualized by abdominal computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. Bowel wall angioedema is occasionally seen in patients on ACE inhibitors and frequently in those with hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACE inhibitors should be suspected in an older adult taking these medications and should be stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5546601\" class=\"local\">'Imaging for suspected bowel wall edema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency also typically presents in older patients. Many patients are found to have an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) should be considered in an adolescent or adult, particularly if there is a family history of episodic swelling or recurrent abdominal pain. A more detailed discussion of the evaluation of abdominal pain in patients with HAE is found separately.

This characteristically happens in anaphylaxis and in bradykinin-mediated forms of angioedema (ie, ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema or hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;, section on 'Airway management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients presenting with angioedema affecting the airway, airway protection must be given priority over a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.

Causes are reviewed elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F97087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97087 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be questioned about any unusual exposures (eg, insect stings), activities (eg, exercise), foods, or other ingestions in the 24 hours before the onset of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of the patient's medications is important, with particular attention to the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;, section on 'Aspirin and NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). The literature concerning angioedema related to each of these medications is reviewed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any new medications or significant increases in doses of medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with previous episodes of angioedema (cutaneous swelling or abdominal pain) should be asked about activities and exposures surrounding those episodes to see if any pattern is apparent. Individuals with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema may have several episodes of swelling before the drug is recognized as the culprit and discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with recurrent orofacial angioedema after dental work or episodes of unexplained abdominal pain may have hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients should be asked about family members with similar episodes of cutaneous or laryngeal angioedema or with recurrent abdominal pain to identify families with HAE. However, about 25 percent of patients with HAE have a new mutation and so do not have a positive family history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioedema is localized swelling of the skin or of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. It is not gravitationally dependent, and it is usually asymmetrical and nonpitting. The margins of the affected areas are often diffuse and the skin may be normal colored or slightly erythematous.</p><p>The presence of other signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction (or more precisely, of mast cell activation) is helpful in narrowing the list of possible causes to those that are mast cell-mediated. These signs and symptoms include urticaria, flushing, generalized pruritus, bronchospasm, throat tightness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. If one or more of these other signs or symptoms is present, the history should be directed toward mast cell-mediated etiologies, such as allergic reactions to foods, drugs, and stinging insects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58834 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;, section on 'Bradykinin-mediated etiologies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory tests that are indicated in a patient presenting with angioedema are influenced by the presence of other signs and symptoms and by the suspected cause, as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576696291\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that the following laboratories be performed in all patients with isolated angioedema: complete blood count with differential, basic chemistry panel with liver function tests, C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and levels of the complement protein C4.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed C4 levels should prompt further evaluation for hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. In cases in which the history suggests a possible diagnosis of HAE or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency (ie, lack of response to antihistamines or positive family history), C1 inhibitor antigen and functional levels should also be measured. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRP and ESR may be markedly elevated during infections (particularly bacterial) and in the setting of malignancies, and elevated to a lesser degree in a variety of inflammatory diseases. These disorders are occasionally associated with angioedema. Elevations in these tests indicate the need for further evaluation based upon the clinical history. CRP may also be elevated in ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

This evaluation is reviewed separately. A specific cause can sometimes be identified in patients with new-onset <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Urticaria/angioedema</span> is considered chronic when it has been present on most days of the week for a period of six weeks or more. The evaluation of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema</span> differs from that of new-onset symptoms, since a specific external trigger or allergy is <strong>not</strong> found in most patients and laboratory studies are most often normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Angioedema with anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A serum total tryptase level drawn shortly after the onset of anaphylaxis may be useful in confirming that the episode was a mast cell-mediated event. Serum tryptase is a mast cell-specific protease that is released upon mast cell activation. Any elevation in serum tryptase suggests an anaphylactic event. However, a normal level does not exclude anaphylaxis because tryptase elevations are variable and transient. Tryptase elevations are most consistently found in patients with hypotension during anaphylaxis. Instructions for proper sample collection are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72041\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72041 \">table 4</a>).

Allergen-specific IgE immunoassays are available for a variety of foods, insect venoms, inhaled allergens, and latex. These tests vary in sensitivity and specificity, but a positive result can be helpful. IgE immunoassays are not altered by recent allergic reactions, so they can be obtained at any time. Allergy skin testing provides similar information and is more sensitive in many cases, but it requires referral to an allergy specialist and should be deferred until the patient has fully recovered from the angioedema event (one month is generally sufficient).

Multidetector CT (MDCT) has been suggested as particularly helpful for diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Most reported cases of ACE inhibitor-induced intestinal angioedema involved the small bowel, with abdominal CT demonstrating circumferential thickening of the small bowel wall with ascites or incomplete obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,18</a>]. The thickened area of bowel wall may have a stratified appearance, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy has not been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Recognition of this complication of ACE inhibitor therapy can spare the patient unnecessary surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of angioedema is made clinically based on a suggestive history and physical findings. It presents as localized, subcutaneous (or submucosal), nondependent swelling that typically affects the face, lips, throat, larynx, extremities, genitalia, or the bowel wall. It develops within minutes to hours and resolves in hours to days. Laboratories may be helpful in confirming an underlying allergy or a complement disorder. However, routine laboratories are normal in many cases of angioedema.</p><p>An algorithmic approach to the evaluation and management of angioedema in an emergency setting is presented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98209\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef98209 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">The utility of extensive empiric testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive testing beyond the laboratory tests already mentioned is of relatively low yield. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p>The utility of extensive testing was evaluated in a large series of 776 patients with recurrent angioedema, without major urticaria, who presented to a referral center over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the majority of these patients, neither the patient nor the referring clinician could detect an association between the episodes of angioedema and an obvious trigger. All patients underwent a careful history and physical examination, sinus and dental radiographs, complete blood count, serum protein electrophoresis, complement studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), hepatic enzymes, renal function, thyroid function and anti-tissue antibodies, stool examination for ova and parasites, urinalysis, pharyngeal cultures, and urine cultures. Further studies, including allergy testing or medication withdrawal and challenge, were performed only if allergy was suggested by the clinical history. A condition or trigger was considered causative only if the angioedema improved after <span class=\"nowrap\">treatment/discontinuation</span>.</p><p>The following potentially causative conditions were identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71000\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71000 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary or acquired angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency was identified in 23 and 2 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were implicated in 11 percent, with a median duration of treatment of one year before symptoms began.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A specific causative factor (a food, drug, insect bite, environmental allergen, or physical stimulus) was identified in 16 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other disorders, most commonly chronic infection or autoimmune disease, were identified in 7 percent. Within this group, chronic infections were identified in 27 patients, 19 of whom had resolution of the angioedema following treatment of the infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three percent did not have angioedema, but rather other types of peripheral or generalized edema.
