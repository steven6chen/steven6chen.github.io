In a 2009 report of surveillance data from more than 100 centers worldwide (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meropenem</a> Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection; MYSTIC), 61 percent of <em>Acinetobacter</em> isolates were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> and 67 percent were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These results are significantly worse than those published in 2007 from the same reporting system (34 and 40 percent resistance, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Carbapenem and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> susceptibility has decreased notably in this short span of time (92 versus 59 percent for tobramycin, and 86 to 92 versus 46 to 52 percent for carbapenems). The emergence of resistance among <em>Acinetobacter</em> strains has also been demonstrated by analysis of The Surveillance Network, an electronic passive surveillance database that collects information from clinical laboratories across the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Multidrug resistance, defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antibiotic classes (excluding fluoroquinolones), increased from 21 percent during 2003 to 2005 to 35 percent during 2009 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Resistance to carbapenems doubled over this time from 21 to 48 percent. </p><p>Other studies have also demonstrated emergent carbapenem-resistant strains worldwide, with exceedingly high rates of carbapenem resistance in some locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/13-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-24</a>], As examples, the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant <em>A. baumannii</em> at two teaching hospitals in the UK increased from 47 to 77 percent from 2010 to 2012, and in one referral hospital in northern Vietnam, more than 90 percent of isolates were carbapenem resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>There are also reports of discordant susceptibility to carbapenems, in which an isolate is susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> but resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Heavy use of third generation cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a>, and imipenem has contributed to the problem of carbapenem resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,27</a>]. </p><p>Although polymyxins, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a>, usually have in vitro activity against <em>Acinetobacter </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], resistance to polymyxins has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Very few trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of different antimicrobial regimens for <em>Acinetobacter</em> infections. Thus, most support for the use of various antibiotics for <em>Acinetobacter </em>infections is based upon in vitro data and observational series. Most of these studies, however, are limited by their small sample sizes, variability in the severity of disease and comorbidities in the included patients, and the lack of a comparator group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H688208201\"><span class=\"h2\">First line agents for susceptible organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When infections are caused by antibiotic-susceptible <em>Acinetobacter</em> isolates, there may be several therapeutic options, including a broad-spectrum cephalosporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>), a combination <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitor (ie, one that includes sulbactam), or a carbapenem (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>).

The clinical cure rates with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to <em>Acinetobacter</em> range from 57 to 83 percent in small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Because isolates that are susceptible to imipenem may be resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, and vice versa, susceptibility to the specific carbapenem should be confirmed prior to its use. </p><p>The beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam also has excellent bactericidal activity against <em>Acinetobacter</em> isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

An additional agent may be warranted if local resistance rates to the chosen antibiotic class are high (eg, greater than 10 to 15 percent).

While there are no clear clinical data to support this practice for <em>Acinetobacter</em> infections, many experts favor empiric combination therapy for serious infections with these and other potentially resistant gram-negative organisms because of the increased mortality associated with inappropriate empiric therapy.

Health care exposures, including prior antibiotic receipt (particularly carbapenems and fluoroquinolones), are associated with colonization and infection due to drug-resistant isolates. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most support for the use of various antibiotics for <em>Acinetobacter</em> infections is based upon in vitro data and observational series. Very few trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of different antimicrobial regimens for <em>Acinetobacter</em> infections. When infections are caused by antibiotic-susceptible <em>Acinetobacter</em> isolates, there may be several therapeutic options, including a broad-spectrum cephalosporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>), a combination <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitor (ie, one that includes sulbactam), or a carbapenem (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>). In the setting of resistance to the above agents, therapeutic options are polymyxins and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a>. Dosing is summarized separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72436 \">table 2</a>).

In general, it should consist of a broad spectrum cephalosporin, a combination <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-lactam/beta-lactamase</span> inhibitor (eg, a combination including sulbactam), or a carbapenem. For empiric therapy of patients with <em>Acinetobacter</em> infection in a location where resistance to the chosen antibiotic is high, we suggest addition of a second agent pending susceptibility results (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone, an aminoglycoside, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> are second agent options. (See <a href=\"#H688212443\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing are available, a regimen can be chosen from among the active agents. We favor choosing the agent with the narrowest spectrum of activity. For patients with infections due to extensively drug-resistant <em>Acinetobacter</em>, therapeutic options are generally limited to polymyxins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tigecycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tigecycline</a>.
