GAS typically causes pharyngitis or skin and soft tissue infection; these are generally responsive to appropriate antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Less commonly, GAS causes invasive disease such as necrotizing infection of the skin and fascia, gangrenous myositis, bacteremia, or pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Invasive disease is complicated by TSS in approximately one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) includes treatment of septic shock and associated complications, surgical debridement of infection (if feasible), and antimicrobial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57969 \">table 1</a>). Such cases frequently require coordinated care from a team, including individuals with clinical expertise in critical care, surgery, and infectious disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of septic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Streptococcal sepsis leads to diffuse capillary leak and intractable hypotension. Therefore, large quantities of intravenous (IV) fluids may be necessary to maintain perfusion (up to 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day);</span> vasopressors may also be required. The approach to management of septic shock is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Streptococcal TSS may occur in the setting of soft tissue infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis. These entities should be suspected in patients presenting with fever and pain, followed by progression to soft tissue swelling and formation of violaceous vesicles and bullae. Surgical exploration through a small incision with visualization of muscle and fascia and Gram stain of involved tissue may provide an early and definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Early aggressive surgical intervention is critical. In some settings, serial debridements are performed until tissue necrosis is no longer evident. Late debridement may be precluded by hemodynamic instability or extension of infection to areas that are difficult to debride, such as the head and neck, thorax, or abdomen. In addition, the benefit of debridement may be diminished once systemic toxicity and overt necrosis have developed. In one retrospective series including 20 patients with streptococcal TSS, major surgical procedures were warranted in more than half of cases; these included fasciotomy, surgical debridement, exploratory laparotomy, intraocular aspiration, amputation, or hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Regimens for empiric and tailored therapy are summarized below. (See <a href=\"#H19825113\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Tailored therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15604631\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, antimicrobial treatment of streptococcal TSS consists of a beta-lactam agent (which inhibits cell wall synthesis) in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (which inhibits protein synthesis).</p><p><em>S. pyogenes</em> is exquisitely susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics; however, use of penicillin monotherapy is associated with high mortality and extensive morbidity in the setting of aggressive infections associated with TSS (such as necrotizing fasciitis, empyema, burn wound sepsis, subcutaneous gangrene, and myositis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/3,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-11</a>]. In one report including 25 cases of streptococcal myositis treated with penicillin alone, the mortality rate was 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Studies of experimental infection have noted an association between penicillin and treatment failure in the presence of large numbers of organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In a mouse model of myositis due to <em>S. pyogenes</em>, penicillin treatment was not effective when administered two hours after onset of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, the survival rate of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>-treated mice with treatment delay of 0, 2, 6, or 16.5 hours was 100, 100, 80, and 70 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>These observations have been attributed to inoculum size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,16</a>]. Penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics are believed to be most effective against rapidly growing bacteria. Thus, efficacy is likely greatest in the early stages of infection when organisms are multiplying quickly. The efficacy of beta-lactams may be diminished as higher concentrations of organisms accumulate and the rate of bacterial growth slows. In the setting of deep-seated infection, the concentration of streptococcal organisms may be sufficiently high to reduce the effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that diminished penicillin efficacy in the setting of high inoculum may be attributable to the available numbers of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) on the organism surface that are available at various points during the phases of bacterial growth. In one laboratory study, fewer PBPs were observed during stationary-phase growth in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> is generally used in addition to beta-lactams in the treatment of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. Several observational studies have demonstrated a clinical benefit to the addition of clindamycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/5,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,18</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of 84 patients with severe invasive GAS infection, use of clindamycin was associated with a lower 30-day mortality (15 versus 39 percent among those who did not receive clindamycin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> has several potential advantages for treatment of GAS infection. The efficacy of clindamycin is not affected by inoculum size or stage of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>], it suppresses synthesis of bacterial toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], and it is associated with a longer postantibiotic effect than beta-lactam agents. In addition, clindamycin suppresses synthesis of PBPs, which are involved in cell wall synthesis and degradation (in addition to serving as binding targets for penicillin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15604893\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be initiated pending culture results; thereafter, antimicrobial therapy should be tailored accordingly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19825113\"><span class=\"h4\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting with clinical manifestations of streptococcal TSS should receive empiric therapy as follows, pending culture results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clindamycin</a> (900 mg IV every eight hours)</p><p/><p>Plus one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A carbapenem (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> 500 mg intravenously every six hours OR <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a> 1 g intravenously every eight hours)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination drug containing a penicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticarcillin-and-clavulanate-potassium-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticarcillin-clavulanate</a> 3.1 g every four hours OR <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> 4.5 g every six hours)</p><p/><p>Patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillin may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> plus a carbapenem.

Penicillin is included together with clindamycin in case the infection is due to an organism that is resistant to clindamycin; this occurs in less than one percent of isolates in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillin may be treated with clindamycin alone if the organism is known to be clindamycin susceptible. In the setting of clindamycin resistance, a carbapenem may be used. It is important to note that an increasing number of GAS isolates with constitutive or inducible resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics, including clindamycin, have been identified in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Some IVIG preparations contain neutralizing antibodies against several streptococcal toxins such as the pyrogenic exotoxins (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin [SPE]A, SPEB, SPEC, and mitogenic factor [MF]), streptolysin O, and DNase B; specific antibody preparations are not commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
