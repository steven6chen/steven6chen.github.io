Neuroscientists and clinicians continue to rely on the mental status or neuropsychological examination for much of their knowledge of the state and functioning of the brain. The study of the behavioral expression of brain dysfunction is the essence of mental status examination and neuropsychological assessment, which is critical to diagnostic accuracy, patient care and treatment planning, rehabilitation and treatment evaluation, and research.</p><p>Methods of examining cognition include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bedside or clinic mental status testing. This is generally the initial assessment of cognition and mental status and can be brief or more extensive depending on the setting and level of concern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental status scales. These are usually used as a screening tool but also as a baseline measure to follow patients over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychological testing for extensive evaluation.</p><p/><p>The goals of the mental status examination are to distinguish normal from abnormal cognition and dementia from delirium or primary psychiatric disease. Bedside or clinic mental status testing is not standardized. Determination of deficits versus strengths often depends on extrapolated norms from standardized neuropsychological tests. Patterns of deficits in the mental status examination can sometimes allow a preliminary hypothesis as to the underlying pathogenesis of a dementing process. The mental status examination also allows a measure of the severity of a patient&rsquo;s problems that can be followed over time.</p><p>This topic will review the mental status examination as performed at the patient's bedside or in an outpatient office. The use of mental status scales and detailed neuropsychological testing are presented separately. Other features of the neurologic examination are discussed separately. Other facets of the evaluation of patients with cognitive disorders are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388586\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL INTERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of mental status, whether in the office or at the bedside, begins with direct questioning and careful observation of the patient during the course of the initial medical history-taking. Many aspects of mental status and cognition can be assessed in this interview: attention, speed of responses, and ability to answer questions and provide relevant information, as well as their overall appearance and degree of cooperation. These observations, along with any specific complaints brought forward by the patient or family member, can guide the examiner into performing a more or less detailed mental status examination. </p><p>The clinical history provides important information that is supplemental to the mental status examination. The patient's age, educational level, and premorbid functioning are obviously relevant, as are medical history and current medications. How the patient functions in his or her daily life as well as any changes in personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships with family and friends are important features to ask about. In this regard, having an independent person to interview, preferably one who lives with the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has a long-standing history with them, is invaluable.</p><p>The clinical interview also provides an opportunity to establish rapport with the patient and make <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> comfortable. The collection of information that is relatively mundane and functional is less stressful than overt testing of cognition. Performance in this setting may provide a less biased assessment than explicit testing, which often contributes to test and performance anxiety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388593\"><span class=\"h1\">MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An assessment of mental status should specifically note deficits in the following spheres:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of consciousness (arousal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention and concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual spatial perception</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Executive functioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood and thought content</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Praxis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calculations</p><p/><p>These spheres as categorized are somewhat arbitrary and overlapping, as are the tests used to evaluate them. The following sections will outline some simple, and some relatively more detailed, tests of assessing these.</p><p>Whenever possible, it is optimal to conduct mental status examination and neuropsychological testing in a quiet room, without distractions. This may be difficult in busy hospital or clinic settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388600\"><span class=\"h2\">Arousal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While taking the history and examining the patient, it is first important to observe whether the patient is alert, attentive, sleepy, or unresponsive. An adequate state of arousal is a prerequisite for further mental status testing. The evaluation of a patient in stupor or coma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388607\"><span class=\"h2\">Attention and concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attention is the ability to focus and direct cognitive processes and to resist distraction; concentration is the ability to focus and sustain attention over a period of time. Assessment of attention is critical to the interpretation of other elements of the neurocognitive examination because patients who are inattentive will exhibit disturbances in cognitive performance, particularly in memory and executive function, thus confounding the interpretation of the contribution of specific cognitive failures.</p><p>Abnormal attention is often evident in the clinical interview; the patient may have difficulty concentrating, be easily distracted by stimuli, lose <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> train of thought, and tend to ramble.</p><p>The most elementary assessment of attention is accomplished through the digit span test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The examiner recites number digits at the rate of one number per second and asks the patient to repeat back the number sequence in exactly the same order. The string of digits increases in length. A normal span is seven digits plus or minus two digits for adults, regardless of age or educational level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Spelling simple words backward or stating the months of the year in reverse are other simple tests of attention and concentration.</p><p>More complex tests of sustained attention also involve cognitive processing speed; time of performance is an important component in these tasks. Examples include part A of the Trailmaking Test (Trails A) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66230 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], symbol-copying tasks (eg, Digit Symbol) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74553 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and letter-cancellation tasks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63183 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. While these tests can be part of the office assessment, they are more typically administered in the setting of formal neuropsychologic testing.</p><p>Prominent deficits in attention and concentration are typical in patients with toxic metabolic encephalopathy and with acute psychiatric disorders, but are less conspicuous in early neurodegenerative disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-toxic-metabolic-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388614\"><span class=\"h2\">Memory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired memory is a common complaint which may be presented by patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family members. Memory has multiple dimensions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate and working memory is assessed by tests of attention including the digit span [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H28388607\" class=\"local\">'Attention and concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent memory involves the learning of new material. Testing orientation to time and place and asking the patient about events of the day are useful tools in the office or at the bedside to assess recent memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A more explicit test of recent memory, is asking patient to remember three to four words, having them repeat them to ensure normal <span class=\"nowrap\">attention/immediate</span> memory, and then ask them to recall the words after 5 to 10 minutes of distraction. For patients who are unable to recall the original words, category hints (eg, &quot;animal&quot;) or multiple-choice cues (&quot;cow, horse, or dog&quot;) can be given to further assess the severity of the deficit. Longer lists of 8 to 10 words can also be used to increase the sensitivity of the test. Normal older adults should be able to remember three out of three words without cues and up to eight words with cues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].<br/><br/>The &quot;three-words three-shapes&quot; memory test is another test of recent memory that can be useful in the office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this test, patients are asked to copy three words (eg, justice, courage, thirst) along with three abstract shapes. Delayed recall is tested in 5, 15, and 30 minutes with re-exposure to the stimuli as needed. If recall is faulty, multiple-choice recognition is tested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrieval of remote memories can be tested by asking for the names of United States Presidents in reverse order as far back as the patient can remember, or by asking about important historical events and dates as well as sporting events and popular television shows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The patient can also be asked about details of personal life such as his or her birth date, the names and ages of children and grandchildren, and work history, assuming independent verification is available.</p><p/><p>Memory functions can also be separated into episodic memory (for specific events and contexts) versus semantic memory (for vocabulary and concepts). These can be differentially affected by neurologic disease. Semantic memory is assessed by asking the patient the meanings of words, phrases, and symbols. Bidirectional naming tasks, in which the patient not only names an object but describes its use or function, is another assessment tool.</p><p>Assessment of memory functions should include learning of visual as well as verbal information. Most bedside assessments of memory employ verbal tasks. In the setting of neuropsychological testing, visual memory is tested using simple and complex line figures (eg, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53426 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The patient is required to construct the figure immediately after exposure and then to reproduce the design after a specified time interval. Other visual memory tasks not involving a constructional component can include the use of photographs; recalling events of a photograph shown to the patient can test recent memory, while remote memory testing might employ photographs of famous individuals. However, failure to recognize familiar faces can also be a visual perception problem, as discussed below.</p><p>Supraspan learning tasks involving a word list are used in the setting of neuropsychologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Learning trials usually involve repetition of a list of 15 to 20 words over several trials to assess whether the patient exhibits a learning curve. A second list is usually administered to serve as a distractor, followed by a short-delay recall trial. Long-delay recall of the original words is typically administered after 20 to 30 minutes. The majority of list-learning and memory tasks also involve a recognition memory format, in which target words are interspersed with foils; patients are asked whether they remember hearing the word through &quot;yes-no&quot; multiple choice format or circling the target words from either lists or stories.</p><p>Many patterns of memory loss may occur. Amnestic disorders are characterized by normal working and impaired recent memory and imply mesial limbic and hippocampal dysfunction. This is a typical early deficit in individuals with Alzheimer disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>.) Patients with Korsakoff psychosis can have even more profound loss of recent memory, which is often, but not always accompanied by confabulation (fabricated material). Retrieval deficit syndromes are more typical of those with frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388621\"><span class=\"h2\">Language</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of language functions begins with listening to the patient's spontaneous speech during the clinical interview. Written and oral language function is further assessed by formal testing and noting deficits in the following domains:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluency. This is usually assessed by listening to the patient's spontaneous speech.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Content. Language errors during spontaneous or tested speech can include paraphasic errors and neologisms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetition. Patients are asked to repeat phrases of increasing complexity. A common screening phrase used is &quot;no ifs, ands, or buts&quot;.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naming. Patients are typically asked to name real or pictorial objects presented to them, again usually beginning with words more frequently used and progressing to those that are less common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comprehension. Understanding of both written and oral language is evaluated by giving a sequence of commands, beginning with one-step, midline commands (&quot;Close your eyes&quot;) and progressing to multi-step commands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reading. Patients are asked to read aloud from a newspaper or from a list of single words.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Writing. The patient is asked to write a sentence spontaneously.</p><p/><p>Verbal fluency tasks ask patients to generate words within a specified length of time. While not specific for language function, this test provides a means for rapid assessment of word knowledge and verbal executive function. Patients may perform differently on category fluency tests (eg, lists of animals) and letter fluency test (eg, lists of words beginning with F). Normal performance is age related, with at least 15 items expected after one minute at age 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease#H406197563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Cardinal symptoms'</a>.) Cut-off scores of 12 for animals and 10 for F words are also commonly employed in clinic settings.</p><p>Validated scales such as the Boston diagnostic aphasia examination and Western aphasia battery are often used in clinical studies and as part of neuropsychologic test batteries; these are too time-consuming to administer in the typical office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>A loss of ability to produce <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> understand written or spoken language is called aphasia. This may be an isolated finding or may be one feature of a patient's cognitive impairment. In the former situation, the assessment of language as described above is used to classify the aphasia according to one of the classic language syndromes listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72780\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72780 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The assessment of language function and the categorization of aphasias are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-aphasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with aphasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388628\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual spatial perception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Problems with visual spatial perception are suggested by a history of losing objects, getting lost, or difficulty navigating familiar or unfamiliar terrain. Patients may also exhibit frank visuospatial neglect when they are observed by family and friends to ignore visual stimuli in one visual field (usually the left) as when searching for objects in the refrigerator or ignoring half their plate at meal time.</p><p>Visuospatial functions encompass perceptual and constructional abilities, which are typically assessed through <span class=\"nowrap\">copying/drawing</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">building/assembly</span> tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the former, patients are asked to copy visual stimuli such as a diamond, overlapping pentagons, a three-dimensional cube, or more complex designs (eg, Rey-Osterrieth diagram) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53426 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Line bisection and Letter Cancellation tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63183\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63183 \">figure 3</a>) can be useful to elicit visuospatial neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Clock drawing is another sensitive tool for visual spatial problems but encompasses abilities from other cognitive domains. Some recommend this single task as a screening tool for dementia.</p><p>Careful observation of abnormal spatial relationships, absence of detail, stimulus-boundedness, loss of three-dimensional perspective, or neglect of one part of the drawing can help distinguish between perceptual failures, spatial confusion, or apraxia. </p><p>The Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III) is typically used as a part of the neuropsychologic test battery and involves constructing blocks to match abstract designs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While deficits in drawing or assembly can co-occur, the two types of activities are more likely to be dissociative and can help discriminate between spatial and visual aspects of a constructional disability, and estimate the relative contribution of each.</p><p>Prominent problems with visual spatial tasks out of proportion to other cognitive deficits, particularly when visuospatial neglect is elicited, suggest specific injury within the nondominant parietal lobe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388635\"><span class=\"h2\">Praxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Praxis, or more specifically, ideomotor praxis, refers to the performance of learned motor movements in the absence of primary deficits in motor and spatial abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. Frank problems with ideomotor praxis may be obvious when patient or family member reports difficulty dressing, feeding, and bathing that is not explained by gross motor deficits.</p><p>On testing, ideomotor praxis is evaluated by asking the patient to perform increasingly complex motor tasks. As an example, the patient may be asked to demonstrate the use of an object (eg, comb, hammer, fork) with and without the actual object in hand. Difficulty with this type of task is often labeled ideomotor apraxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,19</a>]. A step-wise series of coordinated tasks &quot;take this piece of paper, fold it in half, and place it in the envelope&quot; is another way to demonstrate praxis, in this case, ideational praxis, which refers to the capacity to carry out a sequential set of actions toward a final goal.</p><p>A significant language disorder or motor deficit can affect the ability to assess praxis. Common errors include using the wrong object or body part to perform a task. Many patients who cannot perform motor tasks to command can do so spontaneously or by imitation.</p><p>Patients with neurodegenerative disease may also have difficultly performing a series of coordinated tasks. More specific or isolated problems with praxis suggest involvement of the dominant parietal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Ideomotor apraxia is a relatively prominent feature of corticobasal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticobasal-degeneration#H168534479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corticobasal degeneration&quot;, section on 'Cortical dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388642\"><span class=\"h2\">Calculations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple mathematical problems are given to the patient to assess their ability to perform calculations. These include adding a series of coins, and performing &quot;serial sevens&quot; (sequentially subtract 7, beginning with 100). Calculation testing is sensitive to impaired attention and performance (test) anxiety as well as to the patient's educational level.</p><p>Acalculia is the inability to perform mathematical calculations. There are many forms of acalculias, the most specific of which is associated with left angular gyrus lesions. Acalculia is also a feature of neurodegenerative dementia occurring along with other cognitive deficits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388649\"><span class=\"h2\">Executive functioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Executive functioning is a complex set of capacities including volition, planning, purposive action, and effective performance that enable a person to engage successfully in appropriate, goal-directed, socially responsible, and self-serving behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The prefrontal cortex and their connections through the caudate nuclei are the main source of executive functions.</p><p>An overview of executive function is obtained in the history, in which patients and family members may be asked about function in everyday life and with which tasks they may require help or direction. Impairments in insight and judgment are early indicators of executive dysfunction; these are also better assessed in the clinical history (eg, &quot;what problems do you think you are having?&quot;; how would you handle [eg, minor household emergencies]?) rather than by a specific test.</p><p>Evaluation of executive functions is difficult; formal neuropsychological assessment of this domain is usually broadly divided into five types of mental tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working memory is the ability to temporarily hold information in mind and manipulate the information in order to carry out complex cognitive tasks. It is often tested with serial reversal tasks (eg, digits backwards) or sequencing of mixed numbers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> letters of alphabet in ascending order.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to divide attention and ability to change sets (ie, mental flexibility). Examples include the Trailmaking Test, part B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66230 \">figure 1</a>) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50407 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/3,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generative ideation through measures of verbal and design fluency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Verbal fluency tasks are described above. (See <a href=\"#H28388621\" class=\"local\">'Language'</a> above.) Analogously, design fluency tests assess the ability of the patient to generate novel designs within a defined time period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor programming. Tests of motor programming include asking the patient to imitate simple rhythms (eg, clap, clap, tap, knock) or to copy a sequence of m's and n's [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1,2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,20</a>]. Another example is the Luria &quot;fist-edge-palm&quot; test, in which the patient is asked to tap that aspect of their hand to the desk in repeated sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Impaired patients typically demonstrate perseveration, which refers to the phenomenon of being &ldquo;stuck-in-set&rdquo; and continuing elements of previous actions into the present activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to inhibit responses.

As an example, the patient is asked to &quot;tap when I tap once&quot; and to &quot;not tap when I tap twice&quot;. Another test of this function is the Stroop Color-Word Interference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72016\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72016 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].</p><p/><p>Abstract reasoning is a related executive function and usually assessed by asking the patient to interpret similarities and differences (eg, between word pairs such as watch-ruler, child-midget), idioms (eg, warm-hearted), and proverbs (eg, &quot;a rolling stone gathers no moss&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388656\"><span class=\"h2\">Mood and thought content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mood and emotional state have a strong impact on mental status and cognitive functioning. Patients and family should be questioned about mood and outlook. The patient's affect (ie, the outward expression of their mood) should be noted. Depression can present with cognitive impairment and is suggested by a withdrawn affect that can include poor eye contact, tearfulness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blunting. Apathy can be difficult to distinguish from depression. Mood and affect can be incongruent in the case of pseudobulbar palsy where <span class=\"nowrap\">tearfulness/laughing</span> is disproportionate to the underlying feeling, and in brain injury or multiple sclerosis where euphoria in some cases covers up clinical depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-mental-status-examination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The patient's thought content as expressed through the patient's spontaneous speech in the clinical interview and examination should also be assessed. Any abnormal intrusions, preoccupations, perseverations, delusions, or hallucinations should be noted as these are vital to understanding the underlying process. If the patient is poorly communicative it is often worthwhile to specifically elicit such a history of abnormal thoughts, by asking the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family members about these symptoms.</p><p>In the setting of neuropsychological testing, the examiner may employ symptom checklists and other survey instruments to elicit difficulties with mood, abnormal thought processes, and other relevant symptoms that may impact test performance and interpretation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beck Depression Inventory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Geriatric Depression Scale</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychiatric Inventory</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388663\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not routinely assessed, the examiner may wish to test for right-left orientation and finger agnosia, both features of the Gerstmann syndrome which includes dysgraphia and acalculia and localizes to lesions in the posterior left hemisphere. Right-left orientation may be tested by asking the patient to point to or move body parts on the right or left side. Finger agnosia is tested by asking patient to point to or manipulate named fingers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388670\"><span class=\"h1\">BRIEF COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously discussed, a clinical interview in the office can provide an adequate screening of mental status in many, if not most, individuals.</p><p>Over the course of long-term follow-up, when prolonged interviews are not routinely part of a brief scheduled office visit, clinicians caring for the elderly often use brief cognitive assessments to screen for cognitive decline and dementia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) is popular and well known. This tool is assessed on a scale of 0 to 30. The included items cover most cognitive domains, particularly those abilities most relevant to dementia of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s type (AD). The MMSE can be performed in a relatively short time interval (5 to 10 minutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clock drawing has also become popular as a screening tool for cognitive problems as a single task that covers multiple cognitive domains.</p><p/><p>These and other brief cognitive assessments are discussed in detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28388677\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough mental status assessment is arguably more important in the diagnosis and management of central nervous system syndromes, particularly dementing disorders, than any other procedure or laboratory tests, including neuroimaging.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mental status examination, performed at the bedside or outpatient office, provides an initial assessment of cognition and mental status and can be brief or more extensive depending on the setting and level of concern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mental status examination can generally distinguish those with normal versus abnormal cognition, and also dementia from delirium or primary psychiatric disease. Determination of severity of deficits and documentation of relative strengths with respect to age and education requires extrapolated norms from standardized neuropsychological testing. Patterns of deficits in the mental status examination can sometimes allow a preliminary hypothesis as to the underlying pathogenesis of a dementing process. The mental status examination also allows a measure of the severity of a patient's problems that can be followed over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough evaluation of mental status notes competency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deficits in the following cognitive spheres:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Attention and concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Memory</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Language</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Visual spatial perception</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Praxis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calculations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Executive functioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mood and thought content</p><p/><p>Specific tests that provide an assessment of these functions are suggested in individual sections above. <br/><br/>Mental status testing is hierarchical; problems with arousal impede attention, which in turn impedes language and memory and so forth. Furthermore, each test can be affected by multiple cognitive domains. As an example, digit symbol assesses not only attention and information processing speed, but also visual scanning, memory, graphomotor tracking, etc. It is not to interpret individual tests in isolation but to sample at least two tests in each of the mental status areas. (See <a href=\"#H28388593\" class=\"local\">'Mental status examination'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial screening assessment of mental status is usually provided during the clinical interview.
