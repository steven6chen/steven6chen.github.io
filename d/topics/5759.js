Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. But in some women, menopause happens early &ndash; before the age of 40.</p><p>Some women with this condition keep having periods every once in a while. They might even be able to get pregnant. Instead of calling it &quot;early menopause,&quot; doctors prefer to call it &quot;primary ovarian insufficiency&quot; (POI). You might also hear the term &quot;premature ovarian failure&quot; (POF).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440340\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes early menopause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early menopause happens when something causes the ovaries to stop working well. Normally, the ovaries release an egg about once a month. This is called &quot;ovulation,&quot; and it makes pregnancy possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73238 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>In women with early menopause, the ovaries start running out of eggs. As a result, they might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release eggs less often than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop releasing eggs completely</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440347\"><span class=\"h1\">Why did my ovaries stop working?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes early menopause. In some women, causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with their genes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer treatments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain autoimmune diseases, in which the body's infection-fighting system attacks healthy organs (such as the ovaries)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440354\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of early menopause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first thing most women notice is missed periods, or periods that are lighter than normal. Other symptoms you might have are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hot flashes, which feel like a wave of heat that starts in your chest and face and then moves through your body </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme sweating at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in your mood, such as feeling very irritable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dryness in your vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440361\"><span class=\"h1\">What other symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain symptoms can be clues about what is causing your condition. Make sure to tell your doctor about <strong>any</strong> symptoms you have. This will help him or her figure out what is going on, and what treatment you might need. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440368\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you are younger than 40 and your periods have been irregular for at least 3 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440375\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation. Common tests include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pregnancy test</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These measure hormone levels. They can show why your periods are irregular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic tests &ndash; If your hormone tests show that you do have early menopause, you will probably have other blood tests that can show if something is wrong with your chromosomes. (Chromosomes are structures in cells that contain thousands of genes.) The main test to look at chromosomes is called a &quot;karyotype.&quot; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440382\"><span class=\"h1\">How is early menopause treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your condition. The most common way to treat early menopause is with hormones, such as estrogen. These replace what the ovaries are not making anymore. Hormones will reduce your symptoms, especially hot flashes and night sweats. They will also help protect your bones and maybe your heart. Experts recommend that women with early menopause take hormones until at least age 50.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440389\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There might still be hope. About 10 percent of women with early menopause are able to have a baby on their own. When women can't get pregnant on their own, they can still get pregnant with new technologies. These methods use eggs that come from another woman.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440396\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Learning that you have early menopause can be very emotional. You might feel anxiety, sadness, or grief. Some women worry that they will grow old very fast and die young. This is not true. Tell your doctor about these feelings. It takes time to cope. Therapy and support groups can help. You should also tell your doctor if you want to get pregnant. There might still be options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194440403\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-menopause-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Early menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
