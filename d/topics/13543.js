The individual is concerned that embarrassment or humiliation will result, and so he or she avoids such situations or endures them with intense anxiety.</p><p>SAD is a prevalent condition, estimated to affect between 4 and 10 percent of the adult United States population over a 12-month period. SAD typically begins in childhood or adolescence and, untreated, can be associated with the subsequent development of major depression, substance abuse, and other mental health problems. The disorder can be associated with extensive functional impairment and reduced quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic addresses the pharmacologic treatment of SAD. Discussed separately are epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of SAD; psychotherapy for SAD; and fears and specific phobias in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Social anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fears-and-phobias-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fears and phobias in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4191388684\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to selecting among treatments for social anxiety disorder, including the use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, is discussed separately.

The guidance that follows applies to SAD. Pharmacotherapy for performance-only SAD is discussed separately, later in the topic. (See <a href=\"#H2140761904\" class=\"local\">'SAD, performance only'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589968\"><span class=\"h1\">MONOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several classes of drugs are used to treat social anxiety disorder (SAD), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic treatment is quite different for the performance-only version of SAD compared with the general form of SAD (known prior to DSM-5 as nongeneralized and generalized SAD).</p><p>Whenever pharmacotherapy is prescribed for SAD, it is good clinical practice to recommend to the patient that he or she enter previously feared social situations to &ldquo;test out&rdquo; the effects of the medication and to learn that these situations are safe and can be tolerated. Although there are no research data to support this claim, there is some reason to believe that those patients who do the most &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; and &ldquo;expanding of their social horizons&rdquo; while on medication are the ones who have the best longer-term outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589982\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of seven trials that compared SSRIs with placebo in a total of 896 patients with SAD found that SSRIs resulted in greater symptom reduction compared with placebo and had a moderate effect size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. SSRIs are the best studied and the most commonly prescribed of the medication treatments for SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The SSRI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> was the first medication to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 183 patients with SAD to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> (20 to 50 mg) or placebo for 11 weeks. Patients receiving paroxetine were more likely to be &ldquo;much improved&rdquo; or &ldquo;very much improved&rdquo; at the end of treatment with paroxetine compared with patients on placebo (55 versus 24 percent). The mean score on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale was reduced in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group (39 versus 17 percent).</p><p>The clinical effects of SSRI treatment for SAD typically require four to six weeks to have a significant impact; maximal benefit can require as long as 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients should be encouraged to &ldquo;try out&rdquo; the medication by engaging in social situations that typically result in anxiety and to report back about their response. One of the first indications of response is the patient&rsquo;s report of feeling less &ldquo;self-conscious&rdquo; in typical social situations. Higher doses of SSRIs typically result in better outcomes, so the dose is usually pushed to the maximum tolerated by the individual (unless an excellent response is attained at a lower dose, at which point the dose would be held there to ascertain stability of the response). </p><p>Although some SSRIs have been more extensively studied than others in the treatment of SAD, there is no evidence of superiority of one SSRI over another. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paroxetine</a> can be started at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> taken orally and increased to a therapeutic dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> after a few days. If the patient does not respond after a six-week trial, the dose can be increased in 10 mg increments every few weeks to a maximum of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sertraline</a> can be started at 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> taken orally and, if the patients does not respond after six weeks, can be increased in 50 mg every few weeks to a maximum of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p>Common side effects of SSRIs include restlessness, agitation, headache, diarrhea, nausea and insomnia. SSRIs also cause sexual dysfunction in as many as 50 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Many of the side effects can be reduced or avoided by starting the medication at lower doses and increasing it gradually.

After 12 weeks, response rates were similar in the venlafaxine and paroxetine groups, both of which were superior to placebo (59 and 63 versus 36 percent response, respectively). Medication discontinuation rates were similar with venlafaxine and paroxetine, but adverse events leading to a reduction in dosage were more common with venlafaxine (16 versus 8 percent).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Venlafaxine</a> can be started at 37.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> taken orally and increased to a dose within the therapeutic range, between 75 and 225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F81315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81315 \">table 1</a>). SSRI recommendations regarding gradual titration, trial duration, and dose increases apply to SNRIs as well. </p><p>The most common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> are nausea, dizziness, insomnia, sedation, and constipation. Venlafaxine may cause elevations in blood pressure. Though usually small, the increases can be significant in some patients. The medication should be avoided in patients with hypertension, and blood pressure should be monitored during use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are no published data from controlled trials on the use of another marketed SNRI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, in the treatment of SAD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13589996\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MAOIs have the longest track record of use for SAD, having been essentially the only pharmacotherapy available (though never FDA approved) for SAD prior to the advent of the SSRIs. However, side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. MAOIs are generally reserved for SAD refractory to other treatments. Some practitioners feel that MAOIs are more effective than SSRIs or SNRIs, though no comparative efficacy trials have been conducted to substantiate this belief. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors-maois-for-treating-depressed-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) for treating depressed adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several randomized trials have found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a> is an efficacious treatment for SAD, with approximately one-half of patients responding with a clinically significant reduction in symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A 2010 randomized trial that included a phenelzine arm found a response rate of 54 percent for phenelzine compared with 33 percent for placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Phenelzine is typically started at 15 mg once or twice daily, and increased to a total dose of 60 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> based on response. It can take four to six weeks for a response to occur, and longer for maximal response to be attained.</p><p>MAOIs cause inhibition of the MAO enzyme. Irreversible MAOIs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenelzine</a>, are incompatible with certain foods and medications (eg, cheese, aged meats, alcohol, over-the-counter cold preparations). A potentially fatal hypertensive reaction can occur if users of MAOIs consume food containing tyramine; thus, use of irreversible MAOIs must be accompanied by a low tyramine diet. Their use is also contraindicated with other antidepressants, and over-the-counter or prescribed medications containing sympathomimetic stimulants or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextromethorphan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextromethorphan</a>.</p><p>Other adverse effects common at therapeutic doses include postural hypotension, insomnia, paradoxical daytime sedation, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. In many instances, these side effects can be dose limiting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13590017\"><span class=\"h2\">Benzodiazepines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two, small randomized trials found the high potency benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], to be efficacious as monotherapy in the reduction of SAD symptoms. Clonazepam, a longer-acting agent with a slower rate of onset, seems to be more commonly used for SAD than other benzodiazepines. Sedation, the principal dose-limiting adverse effect, can be minimized by starting with low doses and titrating upwards slowly until a satisfactory response is achieved. As either monotherapy of in augmenting a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, clonazepam can be started at 0.25 to 0.50 mg twice daily, and increased to a maximum of 2 mg twice daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3250914566\"><span class=\"h3\">Benzodiazepines and SUD history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedation and the potential for abuse and physiologic dependence limit the usefulness of these agents, which are generally avoided in patients with a history of a substance use disorder (SUD). If other agents are not effective, however, patients with history of an SUD could be judiciously prescribed a benzodiazepine, provided that the SUD was not active and the patient&rsquo;s use of the medication were carefully monitored. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1492676204\"><span class=\"h2\">Gabapentin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> (an anticonvulsant) has demonstrated modest effectiveness (response rates &lt;45 percent) for SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] in a randomized clinical trial. Sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either gabapentin (dosed flexibly between 900 and 3600 mg daily in three divided doses) or placebo for 14 weeks. Patients receiving gabapentin experienced reduced SAD symptoms compared with patients receiving placebo. Adverse events were consistent with the known side effect profile of gabapentin (eg, dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664583588\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregabalin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pregabalin</a>, a compound related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, has demonstrated modest effectiveness (response rates &lt;45 percent) for DSM-IV generalized SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The medication inhibits calcium currents via high-voltage-activated channels containing the a2d-1 subunit, though the relationship of this mechanism to its efficacy for anxiety is not known. Side effects include sedation and dizziness. Tolerance, withdrawal, and dependence are possible, but pregabalin is generally better tolerated than benzodiazepines.
