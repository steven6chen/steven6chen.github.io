This type of infection is caused by a fungus called &quot;candida.&quot; (Yeast are a type of fungus.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241065\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a yeast infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching of the vulva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when you urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, redness, or irritation of the vulva and vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex</p><p/><p>Some women with a yeast infection also leak a small amount of fluid from the vagina. This fluid is usually white and clumpy (like cottage cheese). But it can also be thin and watery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241072\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my symptoms are caused by a yeast infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women cannot tell whether they have a yeast infection or something else. The symptoms of a yeast infection are a lot like the symptoms of many other conditions, so it is hard to tell.</p><p>The best way find out if you have a yeast infection is to see your doctor or nurse. He or she can run a swab (Q-tip) inside your vagina to collect vaginal fluids. Then, he or she can look at the vaginal fluids from the swab under a microscope and look for the fungus that causes yeast infections. Depending on your situation, your doctor or nurse might do other tests, too. For example, he or she might do a &quot;culture.&quot; This is a test to find out if yeast is present and if so, which type of yeast you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241079\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get a yeast infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fungus that causes yeast infections normally lives in the vagina and the gut. Even though the yeast are there in small numbers, they do not usually cause symptoms. Certain medicines (especially antibiotics), stress, and other factors can cause the fungus to grow more than it should. When that happens, a yeast infection can start.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241086\"><span class=\"h1\">How are yeast infections treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yeast infections can be treated with a pill that you swallow or with medicines that you put in the vagina and on the vulva. The medicines that you put in the vagina come in creams and tablets. All medicines for yeast infections work by killing the fungus that causes the infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241093\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will probably feel better within a few days of starting treatment. If you do not get better after you finish treatment, you should see your doctor or nurse again. You might need to take more medicine or a different medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241100\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I get yeast infections often?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Be sure to see or doctor or nurse about it. That way you can find out for sure whether your symptoms are caused by a yeast infection and, if so, which type of yeast. There are a few different types of yeast, and they respond to different treatments. Plus, the same symptoms that you get with a yeast infection can sometimes be caused by other types of infections, an allergy, or other problems. If you get frequent infections, you might need a different treatment than you have tried in the past.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481241107\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bacterial vaginosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bacterial vaginosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
