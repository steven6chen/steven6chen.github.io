However, other analyses indicate that the efficacy of antidepressants varies among different classes. As an example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) collectively have been found to be efficacious (see <a href=\"#H50853897\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below), whereas tricyclic antidepressants often fail to demonstrate any benefit (see <a href=\"#H19515451\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below). </p><p>In addition, within a single antidepressant class, the efficacy of individual antidepressants for childhood and adolescent depression may vary. One such example is the SSRIs; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> has demonstrated efficacy in multiple meta-analyses of randomized trials, whereas the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> is less well established. However, no head to head trials have compared one SSRI with another. (See <a href=\"#H50853897\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Outcomes in pharmacotherapy studies of depressed youth can vary because of methodologic issues. As an example, lower placebo response rates are more likely to occur in trials that are conducted at only a few sites (eg, 3) rather than many sites (eg, 10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-choosing-a-medication/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, it may be easier to demonstrate the benefits of antidepressants in studies that are conducted by experienced investigators at university settings with more severely ill patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109482224\"><span class=\"h2\">All antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antidepressants as a class are efficacious for pediatric depressive disorders. A pooled analysis of 29 randomized trials (3069 patients, age &le;20 years, treated for a median of eight weeks) compared antidepressants (primarily SSRIs or tricyclics) with placebo, and found that response (reduction of baseline symptoms &ge;50 percent) occurred in more patients who received antidepressants than placebo (60 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-choosing-a-medication/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Although a network meta-analysis found that among 14 different antidepressants, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> was efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-choosing-a-medication/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], we disagree with this conclusion. The study was rigorous and included 34 randomized trials with more than 5000 pediatric patients with acute major depression; nevertheless, the finding that only fluoxetine is effective is not justified for several reasons: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to the network meta-analysis, the investigators initially conducted standard meta-analyses of randomized trials to directly compare one drug with placebo or another active drug.

The network meta-analysis found that only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> was better than placebo; however, this may be due to a loss of power in the network meta-analysis. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients who are treated with antidepressants have severe and chronic depressive symptoms; these patients may be more likely to respond to active drugs than placebo, but are nearly always excluded from clinical trials.

In addition, pharmacotherapy is not an emergency medical treatment for pediatric depression. Prior to starting antidepressants, clinicians should educate patients and families about depression, and discuss the benefits and side effects of medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77780\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77780 \">table 9</a>), the potential for increased suicidal ideation and behavior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54498 \">table 10</a>), other safety risks (eg, cardiac events), and the risks of untreated depression.
