LQTS is important clinically because it is associated with an increased risk of a life-threatening form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia called torsades de pointes (TdP) or &quot;twisting of points&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 1A-B</a>), syncope and sudden cardiac death.</p><p>LQTS can be inherited or acquired. The congenital forms are caused either by autosomal dominant or less often by autosomal recessive genetic mutations, almost all of which encode for abnormal cardiac ion channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114927 \">table 1</a>). The acquired forms are caused by a large number of stimuli, most frequently antiarrhythmic and other types of drugs and electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important distinction between the congenital and acquired forms is that the latter can usually be reversed by correction of the underlying disorder or discontinuation of the offending drug. However, some patients with acquired LQTS have a &quot;forme fruste&quot; of congenital LQTS in which a mutation or polymorphism in one of the LQTS genes is clinically silent until the patient is exposed to a particular drug or other predisposing factor.

Nonetheless, certain guidelines can be made concerning the management of these patients.</p><p>The natural history, prognosis, and treatment of congenital LQTS will be reviewed here.

Congenital LQTS is thought to account for 3000 to 4000 of the annual sudden deaths in childhood in the United States.

This ongoing study, begun in 1979 with the creation of an international registry, was designed to determine the natural history of LQTS in the index affected subjects (probands) and their family members. Subjects with the LQTS as well as their first-degree and second-degree relatives were evaluated annually.</p><p>A 1998 report assessed 479 probands with 1041 affected family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. All had a corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;0.44 sec (440 msec). The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 76 percent of probands and 22 percent of affected family members had a cardiac event, defined as syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death (SCD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 70 percent of probands were women. A higher risk of TdP in women has also been noted with acquired LQTS caused by a class IA or III antiarrhythmic drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male probands tended to have their first cardiac event at an earlier age than female probands (8&plusmn;7 years versus 14&plusmn;10 years). The risk of a cardiac event was higher in males until puberty and higher in females during adulthood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68308\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68308 \">figure 1</a>). A first cardiac event after age 15 occurred in only 8 percent of males compared to 40 percent of females. A similar pattern was seen in affected family members.</p><p/><p>The lower event rates in adult men may be explained by the findings in patients with LQTS types 1 and 2 (LQT1 and LQT2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which account for the great majority of identified mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In these syndromes and particularly at slow heart rates, men have shorter mean QTc values (by 12 to 22 msec) than do women or children.</p><p>Another report from this registry evaluated the risk of a cardiac event in 637 first- or second-degree relatives (513 were not taking beta blockers) of 151 probands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The findings among these family members included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A QTc &gt;0.44 sec was seen in 50 percent; 10 percent had a QTc &gt;0.50 sec.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or SCD) occurred in 17 percent. An event was more common in those receiving a beta blocker (46 versus 10 percent), perhaps because these patients had had a prior cardiac event. Among family members not taking a beta blocker, the risk of a cardiac event before age 40 increased with higher QTc values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in probands, adult women had higher event rates than adult men (20 versus 13 percent).

Approximately one-half of the patients were either taking beta blockers or had undergone a left cervicothoracic sympathectomy, while the rest were on no specific antiadrenergic therapy.</p><p>This study examined the effect of different treatment regimens on mortality in patients with congenital LQTS. Key results of this study are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who were not treated with antiadrenergic therapy had a mortality rate of over 20 percent at one year and 53 percent by the 15th year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients treated with antiadrenergic therapy had a mortality rate of approximately 9 percent at three years, and thereafter remained stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-nine percent of family members had QTc intervals that were considered prolonged (greater than 0.44 sec).

Factors associated with an increased risk of aborted cardiac arrest or LQTS-associated death in adulthood included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender (hazard ratio [HR] 2.68, CI 1.10 to 6.50)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QTc 500 to 549 msec (HR 3.34, CI 1.49 to 7.49)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QTc &ge;550 msec (HR 6.35, CI 2.82 to 14.32)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncopal events after age 18 (HR 5.10, CI 2.50 to 10.39)</p><p/><p>When the analysis was limited to the 570 patients who had no history of cardiac events prior to age 18, the same risk factors with similar hazard ratios were noted. Patients with LQT2 were more likely than those with LQT1 or 3 to experience the combined endpoint that included syncope, aborted sudden death, and LQTS-related death. However, in analyses limited to life-threatening events (aborted sudden death and LQTS-related death), genotype was not an independent predictor of outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 13 different genetic defects have thus far been identified in the congenital LQTS: most involve potassium channels, while less common mutations involve the cardiac sodium or calcium channels, and one involves ankyrin B, a plasma membrane protein that physically links the lipid bilayer to the membrane skeleton (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114927 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of genetic analysis permits detection of affected individuals, although variants of unknown significance make genotype-phenotype correlation more challenging. Use of the QTc alone is not always clearly diagnostic, and there can be significant overlap in QTc durations between carriers and noncarriers of LQT1 within families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Using a QTc interval of 0.44 sec as the cutoff, 5 percent of carriers were classified as normal, while 15 percent of noncarriers were classified as abnormal. Thus, in families affected by the long QT syndrome, measurement of the QTc interval alone may not permit an accurate diagnosis. Consistent with the above studies, 63 percent of carriers had a history of syncope and 4 percent of aborted SCD.</p><p>Genetic testing to identify the type of LQTS is commercially available for clinical use. The practical application of genetic testing is limited by the inability to detect mutations in many patients, meaning that a negative test does not exclude disease. As an example, testing was performed for LQT1, LQT2, LQT3, LQT5, and LQT6 in a study of 262 unrelated individuals; a mutation was identified in only 177 (68 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Additionally, age and gender influence the clinical course, with younger males and post-pubertal females at apparently higher risk of cardiac events.</p><p>Genetic data in patients with LQTS have been used to assess the correlation between genotype and clinical events. In two studies, the LQTS genotype was determined and compared with the frequency of cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or SCD) through age 40 years and prior to any medical treatment, with differing results. These studies evaluated patients with known LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3, which account for more than 90 percent of cases of congenital LQTS (42, 45, and 8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>].</p><p>Analyses of the correlation between genotype, age, and cardiac risk have been performed using patients who have undergone genotyping, although the study was criticized due to the relatively small number of families enrolled (541 patients from 38 families) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Most authorities advocate dual chamber pacing because of the predisposition of these patients to have atrioventricular (AV) block, particularly in conjunction with beta blockers. In addition, AV synchrony may also limit ventricular premature beats, which can act as triggers of arrhythmia. Despite these potential advantages, ventricular pacing can cause heterogeneous depolarization that can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias. As a result, we recommend atrial pacing whenever feasible.</p><p>The efficacy of combined beta blockade and long-term pacing in a report of 37 patients with a LQTS (one-half under age 18); 23 had recurrent syncope or TdP while on beta blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after HTLS and received a pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The mean QTc during pacing was 0.50 sec, which represented an approximately 0.05 sec reduction from baseline. During a mean follow-up of 6.3 years, 76 percent remained free of symptoms. The incidence of SCD or aborted cardiac arrest was 24 percent overall and 17 percent in those who continued to take beta blockers.</p><p>These data suggest that, although the combination of beta blockers and pacing is an effective therapy, the high mortality in patients with recurrent syncope or TdP while on beta blockers justify the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which also has pacing capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Events related to swimming (occurring either immediately after diving into water or during recreational or competitive swimming activities) may be specific for LQT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>].

Patients with LQT3 may have fewer events with exercise or stress because they significantly shorten their QTc with tachycardia and therefore become less susceptible to catecholamine-induced arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These findings are consistent with clinical observations that these patients derive less or perhaps no benefit from therapy with beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/16,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> may be beneficial, acting in part by shortening the QTc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. LQT3 results from a failure to inactivate sodium channels and mexiletine is a sodium channel blocker.</p><p>In addition, patients with LQT3 may derive particular benefit from pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], since bradycardia is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and dispersion of repolarization worsens during bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], which promotes pause-dependent arrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with congenital LQTS, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, should be treated with a beta blocker in the absence of a contraindication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69969 \">table 4</a>). Beta blockers are given as monotherapy in patients who are asymptomatic or who do not clearly have syncope related to TdP. The majority of LQTS patients can be treated with beta-blockers alone, without the need for interventional therapies. The rationale for treating asymptomatic patients is the ongoing risk of both cardiac events and mortality over time, particularly in females (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68308\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68308 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75990 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p>Beta blockers are also effective in patients who have had syncope or aborted cardiac arrest, but there is an appreciable <strong>persistent risk</strong> of recurrent nonfatal or fatal cardiac arrest among patients who have had aborted cardiac arrest (14 percent at five years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78184 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Prior syncope is a lesser risk factor for future events.</p><p>Among the major causes of congenital LQTS, beta blockers are most effective in LQT1 and least effective in LQT3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/16,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32</a>]. We have not discontinued beta blockers in symptomatic patients who are known to have LQT3, but have added <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> which shortens the QTc in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p>The goal of beta blocker therapy is to blunt the maximal heart rate achieved during exertion. Both nonselective and cardioselective beta blockers have been prescribed for LQTS patients. Longer-acting agents or sustained-release formulations may improve patient satisfaction and compliance, while cardioselective beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>) may have fewer noncardiac side effects, such as fatigue and mood changes. However, most of the long-term clinical studies have been performed with nonselective beta blockers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>). Not all beta blockers appear to have the same QT shortening effect or clinical outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p>Variable doses of beta blockers have been used in published reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/32,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,52</a>]. In the above study of 869 patients, the following were the average last recorded doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atenolol</a> &ndash; 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoprolol</a> &ndash; 121 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> &ndash; 108 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nadolol</a> &ndash; 79 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day)</p><p/><p>In children, we start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> at an initial dose of 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in divided doses every six to eight hours; the dose is titrated upward every three to seven days to achieve a usual dose of 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day.</p><p>It is not known if higher doses would have reduced the incidence of recurrent events in patients with a history of aborted cardiac arrest. In a report cited above of patients treated with pacing plus maximally tolerated doses of beta blockers, there remained an appreciable incidence of SCD or aborted cardiac arrest at follow-up (24 percent in all patients and 17 percent in compliant patients at a mean of 6.3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Adolescents are at relatively high risk of breakthrough episodes and recurrent symptoms, due at least in part to noncompliance with daily beta blocker therapy.</p><p>Beta blockers should be continued during pregnancy and for at least 40 weeks postpartum, the time of greatest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among women with a personal history of syncope or aborted cardiac arrest, beta blockers can reduce the risk of cardiac events by as much as 98 percent in the postpartum period. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Influence of pregnancy and menopause'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of left cardiac sympathetic denervation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, left cardiac sympathetic denervation is an effective therapy in patients with persistent arrhythmias on beta blockers and in those who cannot tolerate beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/2,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,46,47</a>]. However, although this technique produces significant reductions in the number of subsequent cardiac events per patient, there is still a 5 percent incidence of SCD at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Thus, high-risk patients may be better treated with an ICD. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Role of ICD'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the persistent risk of cardiac events and the availability of other options (such as the ICD), we rarely perform left cardiac sympathetic denervation without an ICD as backup. Our main indication is failure of medical therapy and frequent shocks with an ICD despite medications. However, this procedure is not available at all centers and requires an experienced surgeon. Limited data suggest that the technique may be more effective in patients with LQT1 than in those with LQT2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of DDD pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient is symptomatic and has experienced either syncope or TdP, the use of a beta blocker plus a DDD pacemaker programmed at a rate that shortens the QTc to less than 0.44 sec can substantially reduce the incidence of recurrent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. It has been suggested that patients with LQT3 may derive particular benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], since bradycardia is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and dispersion of repolarization worsens during bradycardia in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>However, there remains an appreciable incidence of SCD and aborted cardiac arrest after the addition of pacing (24 percent in all patients and 17 percent in compliant patients in one report at a mean follow-up of 6.3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Thus, when contemplating permanent pacemaker implantation in a symptomatic patient with congenital LQTS, an ICD should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The ICD can function as an antibradycardia pacemaker, while providing the backup antitachycardia defibrillation when necessary.</p><p>The rationale for choosing a permanent pacemaker over an ICD should be individualized, based upon factors such as patient size, device size and longevity, cost, and the overall <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> ratio. Possible settings in which a pacemaker alone might be used include patients at lower risk who might benefit from pacing because of bradycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> AV block, or known LQT3 phenotype which is associated with higher risk at slow heart rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preceding observations of ongoing risk with beta blockers and DDD pacing or with sympathetic denervation suggest that an ICD should generally be used in survivors of aborted cardiac arrest and in patients with recurrent syncope or TdP on beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This approach is in keeping with the 2008 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/HRS</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of others'</a> above.)</p><p>An ICD can also be considered as primary therapy in selected high-risk patients, such as those in whom aborted cardiac arrest is the initial presentation, those with a strong family history of SCD, or in those in whom compliance with or intolerance to drugs is a concern.</p><p>Early ICD therapy also may be considered in selected patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome who appear to have a higher risk of malignant arrhythmias and, because the disease is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion, the family history may not be informative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009559493\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Mark E.
