EPS causes ultrafiltration failure and bowel obstruction and is associated with significant morbidity and a high mortality.</p><p>This topic reviews EPS. Other, more common complications related to peritoneal dialysis are discussed elsewhere.

EPS is believed to be a result of inflammation in the peritoneum, which causes proliferation and hyperplasia of peritoneal mesothelial cells and peritoneal capillary angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The inflammation is presumed to be due to the dialysis procedure itself and may be related to exposure to glucose or glucose degradation products (GDPs) in peritoneal dialysis fluids.</p><p>An increase in fibrinogenesis and in endothelial permeability causes exuberant fibrin deposition on the peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Any process that increases inflammation, such as episodes of bacterial peritonitis, increases permeability and fibrin deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Some have speculated that increased activity of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in mesothelial cells may contribute to fibrin accumulation. Observational cohort data suggest that patients treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (which inhibit the RAS) are less likely to have functional changes consistent with peritoneal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Repeated fibrin deposition causes formation of a dense capsule surrounding the small bowel, which causes obstruction. Capsule formation may be accelerated after peritoneal dialysis is discontinued. This is because fluid exchanges that are performed during peritoneal dialysis tend to wash away some of the excessive fibrin. When peritoneal dialysis is stopped, the inflammatory reaction and fibrin production continue, but fibrin is no longer washed away by peritoneal dialysis exchanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2234350355\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPS is rare. Among peritoneal dialysis patients, the reported incidence varies between 0.7 and 13.6 per 1000 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-15</a>]. Limitations in study design and detection bias likely contribute to variability in reported individual risk. Many patients with EPS present after peritoneal dialysis has been discontinued (usually for repeated peritonitis episodes, ultrafiltration failure, or because patients receive kidney transplants); these patients are often not included in studies. There is no good screening test, which means that many patients with mild or early cases of EPS are not diagnosed. In addition, some patients who have mild peritoneal fibrosis may be misdiagnosed as having EPS. Not all instances of mild peritoneal fibrosis are true cases of EPS. Also, most studies do not account for competing risks of death.</p><p>The risk also varies among centers and countries. This variability has been attributed to many factors such as genetic differences and differences in peritoneal dialysis protocols (prescribed volumes, peritoneal dialysis glucose concentration, use of biocompatible fluids, and time spent on peritoneal dialysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The risk of EPS may be higher among transplant recipients who used to be on peritoneal dialysis compared with patients who are still on peritoneal dialysis and have not received a transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>]. In one retrospective study that identified 18 patients with EPS, 15 had a history of kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The reasons for the transplantation-associated risk are not known. The increased risk may be related to the cessation of dialysis itself since, once the inflammation process has started, peritoneal lavage with peritoneal dialysis may limit fibrin accumulation and be protective. In addition, calcineurin inhibitors, which are a commonly used antirejection medication, are profibrotic and thus may worsen fibrin deposition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>However, among patients who have EPS, transplantation may increase survival, and EPS is not a contraindication to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1804502727\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>EPS has been reported among nonperitoneal dialysis patients, but this entity is vanishingly rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2920506627\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major risk factors for EPS are duration of time on peritoneal dialysis and severe, recurrent peritonitis.

In a prospective, multicenter study from 57 facilities in Japan, among a total of 1958 patients, the incidence of EPS was 0, 0.7, 2.1, 5.9, 5.8, and 17.2 percent for those who had undergone peritoneal dialysis for 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, and greater than 15 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar findings have been found in other studies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. In one Australian and New Zealand survey, the incidence of EPS was 0.3, 0.8, and 3.9 percent for patients on peritoneal dialysis for three, five, and eight years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe peritonitis</strong> &ndash; Multiple episodes of severe peritonitis (particularly with <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> species, fungus, and <em>Pseudomonas</em>) are a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/11-15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15,19</a>]. In a study of 100 patients with EPS, 28 patients had one previous episode of peritonitis, 29 had two previous episodes, and 33 had three or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Only 10 patients did not have a history of peritonitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Repeated episodes of mild peritonitis do not appear to be a risk factor for EPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Specific dialysate fluids &ndash;</strong> Higher dialysate glucose concentration, the use of acetate as a dialysate buffer, and bioincompatible dialysate may be risk factors. We do not believe there are sufficient data to suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a> is a risk factor.

Inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL) 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and others are mildly increased in patients who go on to develop clinical signs of EPS. However, there is marked variability in concentrations, and their predictive ability has not been demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3962203153\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reliable preventive measures have not been identified. Among all peritoneal dialysis patients, possible preventive strategies include limiting use of high-glucose dialysate as much as possible and using biocompatible, or &quot;neutral,&quot; peritoneal dialysis fluids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal dialysis solutions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since the major risk factor is the duration of time on peritoneal dialysis (particularly after five or more years), some have advocated a time limit for peritoneal dialysis (see <a href=\"#H2920506627\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). However, we do not set a time limit for peritoneal dialysis at our center, since the vast majority of patients on peritoneal dialysis do not develop EPS, and the potential benefit of pre-emptively stopping peritoneal dialysis is offset by the risks associated with hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-during-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications during hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, studies suggest that patients who may have already started to develop the inflammatory process (but which may not be clinically evident yet) worsen <strong>after </strong>peritoneal dialysis is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians rest the peritoneal membrane (ie, stop peritoneal dialysis and perform hemodialysis for a number of weeks to months) among patients who have one or more risk factors, such as those who have repeated episodes of severe peritonitis or who show decreases in ultrafiltration or increased solute transport. However, this practice is controversial since EPS may present or worsen after peritoneal dialysis is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If the decision is made to rest the membrane, then a short peritoneal dialysis dwell should be performed twice weekly just to flush the membrane and minimize possible adhesion formation.

Patients who are still on peritoneal dialysis may show evidence of volume overload including weight gain and edema, despite a history of adjusting of the peritoneal dialysis prescription to increase ultrafiltration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late &#9472; </strong>More prominent clinical features occur in the late stage and result from ileus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritoneal adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. With encapsulation of the bowel, the patient develops symptoms of intermittent obstruction including severe cramping, abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting. In a study of 111 patients with severe, late-stage EPS, the most commonly reported symptoms were abdominal pain and vomiting in 67 and 59 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. By this stage, the exam may reveal an abdominal mass. Occasionally, bowel symptoms may occur in the absence of ultrafiltration failure (although careful review of the chart may show that the patient may have had the prescription adjusted to increase ultrafiltration).</p><p/><p>At times after discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis (such as posttransplant), a patient is diagnosed with ascites but has no symptoms of an ileus or obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. This may be a sign of early EPS.

The peritoneal dialysis fluid may show white blood cells (WBCs), but these are low in number and are generally nonspecific. Serial peritoneal equilibration tests may show a trend toward increased solute transport and decreased ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].

Sequential peritoneal equilibration testing (which is routinely performed to characterize membrane transport) may have demonstrated an initial increase from baseline in peritoneal solute transport followed by a decrease in solute transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. The increase in peritoneal transport is often observed prior to onset of any gastrointestinal symptoms.

The latter condition is characterized by increased fibrous tissue in the peritoneum (discerned by biopsy) and is without symptoms or radiographic changes and almost always without evidence of failure of ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The peritoneal fibrosis in this setting may be induced by episodes of peritonitis (particularly if severe) or may simply be a consequence of a prolonged duration of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).</p><p>Changes in ultrafiltration and solute transport are neither specific nor sensitive for EPS.

We typically instill 100 to 200 mL of 1.36 percent dialysate containing 3500 international units of heparin (which is allowed to dwell for 30 minutes and then drained) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The duration of the rest is typically 4 to 12 weeks, depending on symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stopping peritoneal dialysis &#9472;</strong> We do not permanently stop peritoneal dialysis in all patients. The decision to stop peritoneal dialysis must be individualized and is only made after careful consideration of the risks and benefits of peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis. For some patients, the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with early EPS may be preferred to the complications of hemodialysis (including infectious and noninfectious complications of the hemodialysis access) as well as the lifestyle changes associated with initiating hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;, section on 'Selection of dialysis modality'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, as noted above, the signs and symptoms of EPS such as small bowel obstruction and abdominal discomfort may <strong>worsen</strong> after stopping peritoneal dialysis, and there are no reliable indicators of which patients will worsen. (See <a href=\"#H2794238622\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the decision is made to stop peritoneal dialysis, we remove the peritoneal dialysis catheter and place a tunneled catheter for hemodialysis. Some clinicians advocate keeping the peritoneal dialysis catheter in place and using it to lavage the peritoneum; however, there are no data to support this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supportive care &#9472;</strong> Patients should be closely followed for evidence of developing malnutrition.

In a retrospective study of 50 patients with EPS who underwent enterolysis, 46 patients (94 percent) had complete relief from bowel obstructive symptoms, with an average follow-up period of 35 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3199182547\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2794238622\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major risk factors for EPS are duration of time on peritoneal dialysis and episodes of severe peritonitis. Other possible risk factors include higher dialysate glucose concentration, the use of acetate as a dialysate buffer, the use of drugs such as beta blockers, and transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H2920506627\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Possible preventive strategies include limiting use of high-glucose dialysate and using biocompatible, or &quot;neutral,&quot; peritoneal dialysis fluids. We do not set a time limit for peritoneal dialysis, since most peritoneal dialysis patients do not develop EPS, and the potential benefit of stopping peritoneal dialysis is offset by the risks associated with hemodialysis. EPS may also worsen when peritoneal dialysis is stopped. (See <a href=\"#H3962203153\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early signs and symptoms include anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, and intermittent abdominal pain. With encapsulation of the bowel, the patient develops severe cramping, abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting due to obstruction. In later stages, the exam may reveal an abdominal mass. There are no routine laboratory findings that suggest EPS. (See <a href=\"#H2041160361\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of presentation and computed tomography (CT) imaging. A suggestive clinical history includes gastrointestinal symptoms without obvious cause, particularly in the setting of progressive ultrafiltration failure resulting in fluid overload. Sequential peritoneal equilibration testing that shows an increase followed by a decrease in solute transport prior to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms strongly supports the diagnosis but is not a specific nor sensitive finding. True confirmation of the diagnosis can only be made by laparotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laparoscopy, but these are rarely done. (See <a href=\"#H3480935785\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most peritoneal dialysis patients with EPS, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Tamoxifen and prednisone have been associated with improved survival in a number of retrospective studies. A preferred regimen is daily tamoxifen (10 mg three times daily) for at least three months, with prednisone (40 mg daily) for at least four months, followed by a prednisone taper over an additional six to eight weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2208450938\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not stop peritoneal dialysis in all EPS patients.
