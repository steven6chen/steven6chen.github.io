It is the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal condition and accounts for approximately 30 percent of all referrals to gastroenterologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathophysiology of IBS remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is viewed as a disorder resulting from an interaction among a number of factors. Despite multiple investigations, data have been conflicting and no abnormality has been found to be specific for this disorder.</p><p>The traditional focus has been on alterations in gastrointestinal motility and on visceral hypersensitivity. More recent studies have considered the role of inflammation, alterations in fecal flora, and bacterial overgrowth. Also being considered is the role of food sensitivity. Whether a genetic predisposition exists is also being investigated.</p><p>This topic will review the multiple factors that have been considered to play a role in the pathophysiology of IBS. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapy of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have focused attention on colonic motility, no predominant pattern of motor activity has emerged as a marker for IBS. However, motor abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) are detectable in some patients with IBS. Abnormalities observed include increased frequency and irregularity of luminal contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], prolonged transit time in constipation-predominant IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and an exaggerated motor response to cholecystokinin and meal ingestion in diarrhea-predominant IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The relevance of these motor function alterations to symptoms has yet to be established. However, pharmacologic stimulation of gut motility in IBS patients has been reported to reduce gas retention and improve symptoms, suggesting that a motility disturbance underlies this complaint in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">VISCERAL HYPERSENSITIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visceral hypersensitivity (increased sensation in response to stimuli) is a frequent finding in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Perception in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract results from stimulation of various receptors in the gut wall. These receptors transmit signals via afferent neural pathways to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and ultimately to the brain.</p><p>Several studies have focused on selective hypersensitization of visceral afferent nerves in the gut, triggered by bowel distention or bloating, as a possible explanation for IBS symptoms: (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-gas-and-bloating#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal gas and bloating&quot;, section on 'Functional abdominal bloating and distension'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distention &ndash; Various studies have shown that in patients with IBS, awareness and pain caused by balloon distention in the intestine are experienced at lower balloon volumes compared with controls, suggesting receptor hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. This possible increase in sensitivity may be specific for visceral afferents, since it is reported that patients with IBS have normal or even increased thresholds to somatic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], although there are data to the contrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Rectal distension in patients with IBS also increased cerebral cortical activity more than in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in one study involving balloon distension of the descending colon, increased colonic sensitivity was influenced by a psychological tendency to report pain and urgency, rather than increased neurosensory sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating &ndash; About half of patients with IBS (mainly those with constipation) have a measurable increase in abdominal girth associated with bloating (sensation of abdominal fullness), although this may not be related to the volume of intestinal gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients who complain of bloating and excess gas actually had volumes of gas in the GI tract similar to asymptomatic controls, but exhibit impaired transit of intestinal gas loads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Another study, comparing the effect of a given lipid load on gas motility in patients with IBS and controls, found that IBS patients exhibited a heightened inhibitory response of motility to the introduction of a low lipid load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>It is unclear whether heightened sensitivity of the intestines to normal sensations is mediated by the local GI nervous system, by central modulation from the brain, or by some combination of the two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-28</a>]. In addition, other factors may contribute to visceral hyperalgesia, such as specific gastrointestinal mediators (serotonin, kinins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] or increases in spinal cord excitability due to activation of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19618491\"><span class=\"h1\">INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistologic investigation has revealed mucosal immune system activation characterized by alterations in particular immune cells and markers in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (those with diarrhea-predominant IBS and patients with presumed postinfectious IBS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>].

One study in which full-thickness jejunal biopsies were obtained in 10 patients with severe IBS found an increase in lymphocyte infiltration in the myenteric plexus in nine patients and neuron degeneration in six patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].<br/><br/>These cells release mediators (nitric oxide, histamine and proteases) capable of stimulating the enteric nervous system, leading to abnormal motor and visceral responses within the intestine. Stool examinations from diarrhea-predominant IBS patients have revealed a high level of serine-protease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. A fecal extract from these patients, when infused intra-colonically into mice, increased colonic cellular permeability and visceral pain in the mice; these effects were prevented by serine protease inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The increased risk of postinfectious IBS is associated with bacterial, protozoan, helminth infections, and viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>].<br/><br/>Two meta-analyses demonstrated an increased risk of IBS in patients who experienced an episode of acute gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The larger review of 18 studies (10 controlled studies) reported that the pooled incidence of IBS was ten percent, and the odds of developing IBS are increased sixfold after an acute gastrointestinal (GI) infection. Risk factors for postinfectious IBS included young age, prolonged fever, anxiety, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A longer duration of the initial infection has also been associated with increased risk for IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].<br/><br/>One of the largest prospective studies included a total of 2069 individuals who had been exposed to contaminated drinking water after heavy rainfall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Pathogens included Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni. There were 904 cases of self-reported gastroenteritis and several documented positive stool cultures. The outbreak spawned development of a prospective cohort study to evaluate long-term outcomes in affected individuals. During follow-up, significantly more individuals with self-reported gastroenteritis fulfilled the Rome I criteria for IBS compared with controls (28 versus 10 percent). The predominant symptom was diarrhea.</p><p>The cause of bowel symptoms following acute infection is uncertain, although several theories have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malabsorption &ndash; The development of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption has been observed following enteric infections, which may be result in diarrhea-predominant IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

Neither a reduction in enteroendocrine cells nor improvement in symptoms was observed in a controlled trial of glucocorticoids given to patients with post-infectious IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. One study suggested that increased numbers of enteroendocrine cells and depression were independent predictors of developing post-infectious IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic use &ndash; The use of antibiotics for GI or other infections was observed to be a risk factor for developing functional bowel symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19618505\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERATION IN FECAL MICROFLORA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complex ecology of the fecal microflora has led to speculation that changes in its composition could be associated with diseases including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Emerging data suggest that the fecal microbiota in individuals with IBS differ from healthy controls and vary with the predominant symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-58</a>]. This concept was supported by a study that demonstrated that colonic hypersensitivity in IBS patients can be transferred to germ-free animals by inoculating the animals with fecal microbiota from IBS patients but not from healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Additional studies are needed to validate these observations.</p><p>In view of potential microflora alterations in IBS, it is possible that patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS would benefit from probiotics, which influence the composition and metabolism of the microflora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. One placebo-controlled randomized trial found that administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lactobacillus</a> plantarum did not significantly affect the intestinal flora of patients with IBS, although patients who received the probiotic had a decrease in symptoms of flatulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Similar findings were described in a study in which a probiotic yogurt consisting of a mixture of B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 and K. marxianus B0399 improved symptoms but did not alter intestinal microbiota in IBS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

In addition, increased methane production, a gas by product of intestinal bacteria, has been associated with constipation predominant IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>However, other studies have failed to support an association between SIBO and IBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. The abnormal breath tests in patients with IBS may have been due to more rapid orocecal transit in patients with IBS, rather than SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. In addition, an improvement of symptoms with antibiotics in patients with IBS may be due to an improvement in intestinal motility or a change in colonic flora rather than SIBO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

This theory originated in studies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but has been suggested as well for patients with IBS. The theory holds that fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in patients with IBS or IBD enter the distal small bowel and colon where they are fermented, leading to symptoms and increased intestinal permeability and possibly inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Fructose intolerance has been suggested as a possible form of carbohydrate malabsorption contributing to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as flatus, pain, bloating, belching and altered bowel habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

There are few studies that have explored the pathologic basis for this relationship.

However, steps should be taken to confirm the absence of celiac disease prior to making a diagnosis of IBS in a patient with serologic tests suggestive of celiac disease.

In addition, one study found that having a parent with IBS was a greater independent predictor of IBS than having an affected twin, suggesting that the familial nature of IBS could be due to social learning, as well as genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Associations between specific genes and IBS are under investigation.

The pathophysiology of IBS remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although motor abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract (increased frequency and irregularity of luminal contractions, abnormal transit time) are detectable in some patients with IBS, no predominant pattern of motor activity has emerged as a marker for IBS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal motility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective hypersensitization of visceral afferent nerves in the gut has been observed in patients with IBS and is one explanation for IBS symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Visceral hypersensitivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunohistologic investigation has revealed mucosal immune system activation characterized by alterations in particular immune cells and markers in some patients with IBS. (See <a href=\"#H19618491\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal inflammation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of IBS following infectious gastroenteritis has been suspected clinically based upon a history of an acute diarrheal illness preceding the onset of irritable bowel symptoms in some patients. The cause of bowel symptoms following acute infection is uncertain although several theories (malabsorption, increased enteroendocrine <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/lymphocytes,</span> and antibiotic use) have been proposed. (See <a href=\"#H19618498\" class=\"local\">'Postinfectious'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complex ecology of the fecal microflora has led to speculation whether changes in its composition could be associated with IBS. (See <a href=\"#H19618505\" class=\"local\">'Alteration in fecal microflora'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An association between IBS and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been conflicting. (See <a href=\"#H19618512\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial overgrowth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of food in the pathophysiology of IBS is not clear. Investigations have centered on the development of food specific antibodies, carbohydrate malabsorption, and gluten sensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H19618519\" class=\"local\">'Food sensitivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genetic susceptibility to IBS is suggested by several twin studies, although familial patterns may also reflect underlying social factors. Associations between specific genes and IBS are under investigation. (See <a href=\"#H19618526\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial factors may influence the expression of IBS symptoms.
