The natural history of TAA is one of progressive expansion, the rate of which depends upon the location of the aneurysm and its underlying cause. Although most TAAs produce no symptoms, patients who become symptomatic or have complications related to the aneurysm (eg, acute aortic regurgitation, dissection, aortic rupture) should undergo repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Conservative management of asymptomatic TAA aims to lessen stress on the aorta and limit further aortic expansion. Asymptomatic patients who do not meet criteria for repair also require ongoing aneurysm surveillance. Any patient with additional clinical risk factors (eg, Marfanoid habitus) should be evaluated for possible underlying genetic conditions known to be related to thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). Where expertise in the management of thoracic aortic disease is not available, the patient should be transferred to a high-volume cardiovascular center to provide the best possible outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The management of thoracic aortic aneurysm is reviewed here. The etiology, natural history, clinical features, and diagnosis of TAA, as well as specific techniques for repair of the thoracic aorta, are discussed separately.

In general, repair of asymptomatic thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is not recommended until the risk of rupture or other complications exceeds the risks associated with repair. Asymptomatic TAAs are selected for repair depending upon diameter, location, and expansion rate, with special considerations depending on the presence of underlying contributing etiologies (eg, Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve). Although morbidity and mortality associated with elective repair of the thoracic aorta remain high, for patients who meet criteria for repair, survival is improved for open surgery compared with medical therapy, and this should also be the case for endovascular repair given that endovascular repair compares favorably with open surgery. Asymptomatic patients with TAA who do not meet criteria for repair are managed medically.

Chest pain associated with TAA could represent rapid aneurysm expansion, dissection, or rupture. Chest pain associated with evidence of acute dissection in a true thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm can be the first and only sign of a TAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients whose symptoms can be attributed to the aneurysm should undergo repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm#H114957817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic TAA'</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic aneurysm repair'</a> below.)</p><p>It has been suggested that patients with untreated large ascending or descending thoracic aneurysms are more likely to die of complications associated with their aneurysms than from any other cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In several series of patients, aneurysm rupture occurred in 32 to 68 percent of medically treated patients, and rupture accounted for 32 to 47 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. One-, three-, and five-year survival rates for unrepaired thoracic aneurysms are approximately 65, 35, and 20 percent respectively. After rupture (or other complications), cardiovascular disease is the second most common cause of death among candidates who do not undergo repair. The overall mortality associated with ruptured TAA is high. Only approximately one-half of patients with ruptured TAA live long enough to be transferred to the emergency department for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Without repair, ruptured TAA is nearly uniformly fatal. Unfortunately, regardless of the method of repair, a large portion of patients with ruptured TAA still do not survive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3876712\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic TAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elective repair of asymptomatic TAA may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with TAA complications, but elective repair of asymptomatic TAA is not recommended until the risk of rupture or other complications exceeds the risks associated with repair. Favorable outcomes for open or endovascular repair reinforce the need to repair TAA before it reaches the thresholds described below (diameter, expansion rate), above which the risk of rupture increases sharply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>The most important determinant of TAA rupture is the diameter of the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/12,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22-25</a>]. Other factors, such as a rapidly expanding aortic diameter, concomitant bicuspid aortic valve, or connective tissue disease also increase the risk for rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

It is also more likely to cause the patient's death before the development of TAA complications. (See <a href=\"#H277993510\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular risk reduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2231878176\"><span class=\"h3\">Diameter criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important determinant of TAA rupture or other complications (eg, dissection) is the diameter of the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/16,22-24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22-24,26</a>]. The diameter threshold to recommend elective repair varies by the location and etiology of the aneurysm, among other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One group has shown that the clinical threshold for rupture mirrors the innate physical limits of the aortic wall. As the aorta approaches 6 cm, its distensibility rapidly falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At this diameter, the aorta loses its natural elasticity and effectively becomes a rigid tube. At a blood pressure of 200 mmHg, easily achieved through strenuous exercise or emotional distress, the stress generated in the wall of a 6-cm aorta can attain or exceed the maximum tensile strength of aortic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2579624299\"><span class=\"h4\">Sporadic TAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with sporadic (degenerative) TAA (ie, <strong>not</strong> associated with genetically mediated conditions), we suggest elective repair of ascending TAA for end-diastolic aortic diameter &gt;5.5 cm, and elective repair of descending TAA with a diameter &gt;5.5 cm for patients with a low risk for perioperative complications. For higher-risk patients, we use a descending aortic diameter &gt;7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/5,7,16,22-24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,16,22-24,26</a>]. What constitutes high risk in not well defined. The use of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (PROM) score &gt;8, frailty score &gt;2, and more than one major organ system impairment has been used in an effort to stratify risk for aortic surgery in those with bicuspid aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Based on observational studies, the risk of complications of TAA (rupture, dissection) increases with larger aortic diameter, in particular, once the ascending aorta expands beyond 6 cm, or the descending aorta expands beyond 7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early study of 133 patients with ascending TAA, descending TAA, or both found that the overall five-year risk of rupture was 0 percent for those less than 4.0 cm compared with 16 and 31 percent for TAA 4.0 to 5.9 and &ge;6.0 cm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The combined endpoint of rupture, dissection, or death overall occurred at a rate of 16 percent per year among patients with TAA &ge;6.0 cm. The overall five-year survival rate in patients with TAA &gt;6.0 cm was 56 percent. In patients who did not undergo surgery (diameter not specified), 54 percent were alive at five years.

In a review of 591 patients with type A dissection enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), the mean diameter was 5.3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nearly 60 percent of patients had an ascending aortic diameter &lt;5.5 cm, and 40 percent had an aortic diameter &lt;5.0 cm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3877097\"><span class=\"h4\">Genetically mediated thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetically mediated thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) can be part of a syndrome (ie, syndromic) such as Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Turner syndrome, or nonsyndromic, as with familial TAAD and bicuspid aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Prophylactic surgery in the setting of many hereditary TAA disorders is uncertain and may depend upon the specific mutation, family history, absolute aortic size, and growth rate. It is recognized that TAA due to mutations in SMAD3, ACTA2, and MYLK may lead to dissection at relatively small aortic diameters. Decision making in patients with genetically mediated TAAD, particularly in younger patients (&lt;60 years old), takes into account the diameter of the ascending <span class=\"nowrap\">aorta/proximal</span> arch but also the diameter of the aortic root and aortic valve function. </p><p>Marfan patients should generally undergo elective operation at a smaller aortic diameter than patients with sporadic aortic aneurysms to reduce the risk of TAA complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/3,4,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,30,31</a>]. Elective repair is warranted for aortic root diameter &ge;5.0 cm, with repair at a diameter &gt;4.5 cm in those with a family history of dissection, or other high-risk features suggested for those with progressive aortic regurgitation, family history of dissection, or rapid expansion (increase by 5 mm or more per year). Elective repair at a smaller ascending aortic diameter in surgical centers with expertise in the repair of the aortic root and ascending aorta is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/3,5,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,32,33</a>].

Although the aortic valve eventually requires replacement in over 75 percent of patients due to progressive aortic stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve is often associated with ascending aortic aneurysm in the absence of significant valvular disease. For some patients, repair of TAA becomes necessary before aortic valve operation is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. For asymptomatic patients with bicuspid aortic valve, an ascending aortic diameter &gt;5.5 cm warrants repair (lower for smaller stature); however, for patients with additional risk factors for complications (eg, family history of aortic dissection, rapid expansion &gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year),</span> repair at an ascending aortic diameter 5.0 to 5.5 cm, or &gt;4.5 cm in those with severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation, is reasonable to reduce the risk for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For those at low risk for aneurysm resection with surgery performed in a center with expertise, surgery at &gt;5.0 cm can be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This recommendation is based on data from single-center observational studies of patients who underwent aortic valve replacement for valvular dysfunction. Patients with ascending aortic diameter of 4.0 to 4.5 cm at the time of isolated aortic valve replacement had an increased risk of ascending aortic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/3,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,40</a>].

Elective ascending aortic repair is recommended <strong>before</strong> the ascending aortic index (aortic diameter [cm] divided by body surface area [m]) is 2.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Another method to account for body size suggests that, for cases of Marfan syndrome, it may be reasonable to perform elective aortic root replacement for patients with an ascending aortic area (cm<sup>2</sup>) to height (m) ratio of 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This index is also being used for those with bicuspid aortic valve-associated aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3877273\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid expansion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a TAA develops, the natural history is one of progressive enlargement with variable expansion rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Expansion rates range from 1 to 10 mm per year, depending upon TAA etiology, diameter, and location within the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/16,17,20,45,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,20,45,48-51</a>]. Reports of rapid expansion can reflect measurement errors; however, when rapid expansion is seen, it should raise concern for aortic dissection or aortic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

This was illustrated in a study of 67 patients with TAA who underwent serial computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The rate of expansion for aneurysms &gt;5.0 cm in diameter was approximately 8 mm per year but was approximately 2 mm per year for aneurysms &lt;5.0 cm. A history of hypertension did not affect the rate of aneurysm expansion. However, these studies are older, and the location and specific etiology of the aneurysm may not have been taken into account. Larger-diameter aortas (&gt;5.0 cm at the time of diagnosis) can have expansion rates up to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59360 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The anatomic location of the aneurysm is another factor associated with the rate of expansion. In a series of 87 patients who underwent vascular imaging, aneurysms located within the mid-portion of the descending aorta showed the most rapid expansion, while those in the ascending aorta had the slowest expansion rate, despite having a greater initial diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51157 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Open repair of ascending TAA is performed via a median sternotomy with hypothermic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass including cardioplegia and often requires aortic root replacement or coronary artery reimplantation. The diseased aortic segment is replaced with either a composite graft (Bentall) or valve-sparing procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

Open repair of descending TAA is via a thoracotomy and often does not require full cardiopulmonary bypass or cardioplegia; however, measures to protect the spinal cord are important. End-organ revascularization (visceral, renal) may require native arterial reimplantation with or without endarterectomy, or bypass grafting.

Endovascular repair requires fulfillment of specific anatomic criteria, and the greatest experience involves treatment of descending TAA that does not involve the abdominal visceral segment. The role of stent-grafting for extensive thoracoabdominal aortic disease, which requires debranching procedures or specialized grafts (fenestrated, branched endografts), is an area of active clinical research. Although endovascular repair is associated with lower perioperative mortality, late complications, including graft migration and aortic rupture, have been reported.

Endovascular repair combined with a debranching procedure may still be an option for distal TAA but cannot generally be performed in an urgent setting given the need for customized endovascular devices.

Unfavorable late aortic remodeling at the site of stent-graft placement has been reported, likely related to the persistent radial force of these devices against the abnormal aortic tissue. However, some feel that stent-grafting may be justified in emergencies as a &quot;bridging&quot; method to later definitive surgical repair, though elective repair has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H277993201\" class=\"local\">'Management of asymptomatic TAA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H278008193\" class=\"local\">'Identifying associated genetic conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H278008157\" class=\"local\">'Identifying associated aneurysm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of TAA is one of progressive expansion. The rate of expansion depends upon the location and diameter of the aneurysm and its underlying etiology. Most TAAs produce no symptoms. Patients with asymptomatic TAA should be followed for the development of signs and symptoms that may be associated with the TAA. The surveillance schedule is based upon the etiology, site, and diameter of the aneurysm at presentation, and expansion rates identified at follow-up. Ideally, serial CT or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography studies should be performed using the same imaging technique at the same center. (See <a href=\"#H4174666573\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following the initial study that identified TAA, we suggest imaging six months after the initial study to ensure the stability of the aneurysm diameter and extent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the TAA does not demonstrate expansion after six months, we suggest annual imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the TAA demonstrates expansion or is approaching the diameter threshold for repair, we suggest imaging every three to six months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with asymptomatic TAA who are being conservatively managed, control of hypertension is recommended to limit further aortic expansion. We suggest beta blocker therapy rather than other agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The goal systolic pressure is 105 to 120 mmHg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for blood pressure control is an acceptable alternative for those who do not tolerate beta blocker therapy. The majority of patients have concomitant cardiovascular disease; thus, managing cardiovascular risk factors (eg, smoking cessation, antiplatelet therapy, statin therapy) is also important. Statin therapy may also reduce aortic expansion, but this is unproven for TAA. (See <a href=\"#H277994703\" class=\"local\">'Antihypertensive therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H277993201\" class=\"local\">'Management of asymptomatic TAA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms such as chest pain in a patient with TAA (known or unknown) can represent rapid aneurysm expansion or be due to a variety of life-threatening complications, including aortic dissection, acute aortic regurgitation, aortic leakage, or overt aortic rupture. Patients who develop symptoms attributable to TAA should undergo urgent repair (open surgical, endovascular), provided the risk for repair is not prohibitive. (See <a href=\"#H3876529\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic (nonruptured) and ruptured TAA'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm#H114957817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic TAA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elective repair of asymptomatic TAA is not undertaken until the risk of rupture or other complications exceeds the risks associated with repair. Candidates for repair are selected depending upon diameter, location, expansion rate, and patient comorbidities, taking into account the presence of underlying contributing etiologies. The most important factor determining the risk for TAA complications is the diameter of the aneurysm. Among patients with genetically mediated TAA, aortic diameter thresholds are lower, and a decision for repair also needs to consider the diameter of the aortic root and functional status of the aortic valve. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most patients with asymptomatic TAA, we use the following thresholds as criteria for elective repair. (See <a href=\"#H4272180008\" class=\"local\">'Summary of indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ascending TAA: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>End-diastolic aortic diameter &gt;5.5 cm <strong>or</strong> aortic size index (aortic diameter [cm] divided by body surface area [m<sup>2</sup>]) &ge;2.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3877097\" class=\"local\">'Genetically mediated thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For smaller patients, including many women, a diameter greater than twice the diameter of the nonaneurysmal aorta (normal segment) or aortic size index can be used. (See <a href=\"#H3877225\" class=\"local\">'Accounting for body size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid expansion &ge;10 mm per year for aneurysms &lt;5.0 cm in diameter. For patients with associated genetically mediated conditions, a lower expansion rate (eg, &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year)</span> is suggested as an indicator for repair. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not meet the above criteria, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing elective repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These patients are followed conservatively and are considered for repair if symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H3875911\" class=\"local\">'Indications for repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4272180008\" class=\"local\">'Summary of indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3054172779\" class=\"local\">'Counseling the high-risk patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to TAA repair (open, endovascular) takes into account the location and anatomic extent of the aneurysm, etiology, and the patient's expected survival (short-term and long-term), which depends upon the patient's age and medical comorbidities. Ascending TAA is managed with an open surgical approach using cardiopulmonary bypass and often requires aortic root replacement or coronary artery reimplantation. Descending TAA can be repaired with an open or endovascular approach, the choice of which depends upon whether the etiology is sporadic or genetically mediated. For patients with sporadic (degenerative) descending TAA, we suggest an endovascular approach for initial repair rather than an open approach, provided the thoracic aortic anatomy is suitable for endografting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Endovascular repair is associated with reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality; however, the long-term durability of endovascular TAA repair compared with open surgical repair remains uncertain. An open approach should be used for those with syndromic TAAD. The approach for those with nonsyndromic TAAD is less well defined. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic aneurysm repair'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-open-surgical-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of open surgical repair of the thoracic aorta&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with TAA with indications for repair should receive treatment at a facility where expertise in the management of thoracic aortic disease and the perioperative resources necessary for major aortic surgery are available (eg, operating room personnel, an appropriately trained surgeon, perioperative intensive care). For patients who present to a facility where these are not available, referral (or transfer) to a high-volume cardiovascular center is appropriate.
