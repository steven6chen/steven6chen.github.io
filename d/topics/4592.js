When we eat, our body breaks the food down into different nutrients. These nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The body uses carbohydrates for energy.</p><p>Foods with a lot of carbs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bread, pasta, rice, and cereal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fruits and starchy vegetables</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk and other dairy foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods with added sugar (such as many cookies and cakes)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14019708\"><span class=\"h1\">What does &quot;counting carbs&quot; mean?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Counting carbs (also called &quot;carb counting&quot;) is a type of meal planning that many people with diabetes use. It involves figuring out the number of carbs you eat. When people count carbs, they keep track of how many carbs they eat for each meal and snack.</p><p>People with diabetes need to know how many carbs they eat because eating carbs raises a person's blood sugar level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14019715\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I count carbs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your food has a nutrition label, you can look at the information on the nutrition label. You need to look at the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Total carbohydrate&quot; number &ndash; This tells you how many carbs are in 1 serving size of the food. If you eat 1 serving, then the number of carbs you eat is the same as the number of total carbohydrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Serving size&quot; &ndash; This tells you how much food is in 1 serving. If you have 2 servings, the number of carbs will be 2 times the number of carbohydrates listed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Dietary fiber&quot; &ndash; Fiber is a carbohydrate that is not digested, which means it does not raise blood sugar. Foods with a lot of fiber can help control a person's blood sugar. If a food has more than 5 grams (g) of fiber, less insulin is needed for that food (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76576 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Many foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, don't have a nutrition label. For these foods, you will need to learn about the usual serving sizes of different foods. You will also need to learn how many carbs are in 1 serving.</p><p>Your doctor, nurse, or dietitian (food expert) will tell you how many carbs you should eat in 1 day. It will depend partly on your height, weight, how active you are, and your medicines. You can divide this total number of carbs up over the day and eat some at each meal and snack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14019722\"><span class=\"h1\">Can counting carbs help me manage my diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Counting carbs can help you manage your diabetes by keeping your blood sugar level under better control. Counting carbs can help keep your blood sugar level from getting too high (especially after meals) or too low.</p><p>It's important to keep your blood sugar level under control, because blood sugar levels that are too high or too low can lead to immediate and serious problems. In addition, having high blood sugar levels for a long time can lead to kidney, nerve, and eye problems later on.</p><p>Counting carbs can also help you plan your meals and snacks each day. Knowing how many carbs you can eat at each meal or snack can help you choose foods to eat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14019729\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following tips might help when you count carbs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spread out your carbs over 4 to 6 small meals each day instead of 3 big ones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat the same number of carbs at each meal, for example, at each dinner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat your meals at the same time each day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan your meals ahead of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your blood sugar before you eat and 1 hour after you eat. This can help you learn how certain foods affect your blood sugar. You can check your blood sugar level at home using a device called a &quot;blood glucose monitor.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep a record of your meals and blood sugar levels. Show it to your doctor or nurse so that he or she can change your treatment as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remember that other things besides carbs can raise or lower your blood sugar level. These things can include exercise, getting sick, drinking alcohol, travelling, and stress.</p><p/><p>If you have any questions about counting carbs or meal planning, ask your doctor, nurse, or dietitian.
