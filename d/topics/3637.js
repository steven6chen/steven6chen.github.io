Multiple classification schemes have been employed for these diseases over the years. These have included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gall and Mallory classification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rappaport classification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kiel classification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lukes-Collins classification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working Formulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revised European-American classification (REAL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>French-American-British system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>World Health Organization (WHO) classification 2001</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>World Health Organization (WHO) classification 2008, revised in 2016</p><p/><p>The earliest classification systems were based upon tissue architecture and the cytologic appearances of the neoplastic cells. For a few entities (eg, follicular lymphoma), these morphologic features are often sufficient to establish the diagnosis. However, with the development and application of immunophenotyping and cytogenetic and molecular genetic testing, it was recognized that many distinct entities existed that could not be distinguished reliably by morphology alone. This appreciation led to the incorporation of immunophenotype and genetic criteria into the REAL classification of lymphoid neoplasms in 1994. Numerous subsequent analyses demonstrated that the REAL classification had &quot;added value&quot; over older systems for determining prognosis and patient stratification. In 2001, immunophenotype and genetic findings were incorporated into a new WHO classification, which subsumed the REAL classification and included tumors of myeloid or mixed lineage origin.</p><p>The latest WHO classification, updated in 2016, further refined and expanded upon the use of objective diagnostic criteria (eg, particular molecular markers) for clearly defined entities and is widely used and accepted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. However, it remains important for clinicians to be familiar with prior classification systems in order to interpret the older literature and to care for patients who were previously treated for hematopoietic neoplasms with now outdated names. A nested classification of lymphoid neoplasms proposed by the Pathology Working Group of the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium, which is based on the WHO classification and the third edition of the International Classification of Diseases-Oncology, provides a guide for translation of previous classification systems into the present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the current classification system, the 2016 revisions to the WHO classification, the biology of which is discussed separately.

In addition, there are borderline categories for cases that do not fit into a defined entity. This approach has been adapted to improve the accurate assessment of patient outcomes in &quot;typical&quot; disease and to enable the study of borderline cases.</p><p>When possible, the different tumor types are grouped by lineage into:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myeloid neoplasms</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 2</a>) &ndash; Derived from those bone marrow progenitor cells that normally develop into erythrocytes, granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), monocytes, or megakaryocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphoid neoplasms</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 1</a>) &ndash; Derived variously from B cell progenitors (bone marrow derived), T cell progenitors (thymus-derived), mature T lymphocytes (cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, or T regulatory cells) or mature B lymphocytes (B cells or plasma cells).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Histiocytic/dendritic</span> neoplasms</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 1</a>) &ndash; Derived from cells that normally develop into &quot;professional&quot; antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) or tissue macrophages (histiocytes).</p><p/><p>There are also neoplasms that show evidence of both myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, presumably because they are derived from multipotent progenitor cells.

These diseases are often associated with mutations that cause abnormal increases in activity of pro-growth signaling pathways, leading to the growth factor-independent proliferation of bone marrow progenitors. Bone marrow cellularity is usually increased, but may be normal. The percentage of blasts in the bone marrow may be normal or slightly increased, but is always &lt;20 percent. Although some skewing of differentiation may be seen (producing increases in the proportion of certain cell types, such as eosinophils or basophils), hematopoiesis usually is effective. The combination of effective hematopoiesis and increased numbers of progenitors typically leads to an increase in the number of one or more formed elements in the peripheral blood.</p><p>The following entities are included under the category of MPNs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)</strong> &ndash; CML demonstrates excessive proliferation of the granulocytic lineage at all stages of maturation and is always associated with the presence of a <em>BCR-ABL1</em> fusion gene, which is usually created by a reciprocal translocation that results in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22).

Like ET, it is associated with mutations in <em>JAK2</em>, <em>MPL</em>, and <em>CALR</em> in approximately 50 percent, 5 percent, and 30 percent of cases, respectively. Some data suggest that PMF may be best viewed as a stage of MPN progression, rather than a distinct entity. Indeed, CML, PV, and ET can all evolve to a picture that mimics PMF.

In general, the lymphoid neoplasms are divided into neoplasms derived from lymphoid precursors (eg, acute lymphoblastic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma)</span> and neoplasms of mature lymphocytes and plasma cells. These are further grouped depending upon whether they are of B or T cell derivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Historically, lymphoid neoplasms that present with bone marrow and blood involvement (leukemia) have been segregated from those that present as a mass (lymphoma). However, it is now appreciated that any &quot;lymphoma&quot; can present with or evolve to a leukemic picture, and any &quot;leukemia&quot; may occasionally present as a mass lesion. In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the diagnosis of the various lymphoid neoplasms depends not on the anatomic location of tumor cells, but rather on the cell of origin of the tumor, as judged by morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic findings. As a result, several entities previously considered distinct are now grouped together under single diagnostic categories.

However, some clinical trials have separated histologic subtypes according to the usual clinical behavior of each of the lymphoid neoplasms, which can be roughly segregated into three groups, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59978 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indolent</strong> &ndash; Survival of untreated indolent lymphoid neoplasms is generally measured in years.

Malignancies that do not fit defined entities are placed in categories that capture diverse tumors (eg, peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified) or in borderline &quot;grey zone&quot; categories that are used for cases that share features of more than one entity (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma). When possible, the different tumor types are grouped by lineage as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myeloid neoplasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 2</a>) &ndash; Derived from those bone marrow progenitor cells that normally develop into erythrocytes, granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), monocytes, or megakaryocytes. These neoplasms can be categorized into three broad clinicopathologic classes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</strong> &ndash; AML is defined by greater than 20 percent myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, or the presence of particular cytogenetic abnormalities, regardless of the blast count. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute myeloid leukemia and related aggressive myeloid neoplasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)</strong> &ndash; Clonal stem cell disorders associated with the proliferation of one or more of the myeloid lineages (eg, granulocytic, erythroid, or megakaryocytic). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Myeloproliferative neoplasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)</strong> &ndash; Disorders that exhibit dysplasia and ineffective blood cell production. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Of note, some cases show features that overlap between those of a MPN and a MDS, and all MPN and MDS have the potential to transform into AML. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'MDS/MPN syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Mastocytosis</strong> &ndash; Disorders characterized by the accumulation of pathologic mast cells in tissues. These are often associated with mutations that activate the tyrosine kinase activity of the c-KIT receptor. (See <a href=\"#H4049086787\" class=\"local\">'Mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphoid neoplasms</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 1</a>) &ndash; Derived variously from B cell progenitors (bone marrow derived), T cell progenitors (thymus-derived), mature T lymphocytes (cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, or T regulatory cells) or mature B lymphocytes (B cells or plasma cells). Historically, lymphoid neoplasms that present with bone marrow and blood involvement (leukemia) have been segregated from those that present as a mass (lymphoma). However, it is now appreciated that any &quot;lymphoma&quot; can present with or evolve to a leukemic picture, and any &quot;leukemia&quot; can occasionally present as a mass. Lymphoid neoplasms are mainly grouped depending upon whether they are of B, T, or natural killer (NK) cell derivation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoid neoplasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Histiocytic/Dendritic</span> neoplasms</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110240 \">table 1</a>) &ndash; Derived from cells that normally develop into &quot;professional&quot; antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) or tissue macrophages (histiocytes). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Histiocytic/dendritic neoplasms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>There are also neoplasms that show evidence of both myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, presumably because they are derived from multipotent progenitor cells. Such cases are given their own category, neoplasms of myeloid and lymphoid lineage. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neoplasms with myeloid and lymphoid lineage'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Harris NL, et al.
