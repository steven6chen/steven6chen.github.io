Although most commonly a sporadic disease, primary HPT can be a part of an inherited genetic syndrome in a small subset of patients. These inherited syndromes include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), hyperparathyroid-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT), and familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHPT). An inherited form of HPT should be suspected in younger patients, especially those with multiglandular disease, and those with a family history of an endocrinopathy that is known to be associated with HPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Parathyroid surgery for the treatment of inherited syndromes will be reviewed here.

Studies have evaluated the role of more limited initial resections (either resection of a single gland or unilateral clearance of both parathyroid glands) in cases where preoperative imaging demonstrates a concordant single focus of disease and intraoperative PTH levels drop adequately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although associated with short-term success, these studies have small sample sizes and limited long-term follow-up. Given the high rates of persistent and recurrent HPT in patients with MEN1, resections that are less than subtotal are not advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1306041764\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice of initial procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically perform a subtotal (removal of 3 to 3.5 parathyroid glands) rather than total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,26</a>].

After a mean follow-up of 7.5 years, similar proportions of patients in each group had transient (6 out of 17 versus 6 out of 15) or permanent hypoparathyroidism (2 out 17 versus 1 out of 15), developed recurrent HPT (4 out of 17 versus 2 out of 15), or required reoperation (4 out 17 versus 1 out of 15).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2457896748\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of parathyroid surgery in young, asymptomatic MEN1 patients is controversial.

Delaying parathyroidectomy until the glands are more enlarged could make the surgery simpler, and decrease the likelihood of persistent or recurrent disease that would necessitate remedial surgery. The timing of surgery in MEN1 patients is reviewed elsewhere.

In this test, a baseline PTH value is drawn from the non-grafted arm. The grafted arm is then rendered ischemic for 10 minutes by using an Esmarch bandage before another PTH value is drawn from the non-grafted arm. Comparison of the two PTH values determines the source(s) of recurrent HPT as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positive (arm recurrence)</strong>: Patients with forearm autograft-dependent recurrence demonstrate a drop in systemic PTH of more than 50 percent after 10 minutes of grafted arm ischemia.

If visual exploration is unsuccessful, intraoperative differential venous parathyroid hormone (PTH) sampling of both internal jugular veins may help lateralize a hyperfunctioning gland to one side of the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Venous sampling is typically performed with a 23 or 25 gauge needle and analyzed in real-time using an intraoperative PTH assay. Lateralization is defined by a greater than 5 percent difference between the two PTH values. Venous sampling is more sensitive for identifying hyperfunctioning superior parathyroid glands.</p><p>If a parathyroid gland is deduced or suspected to be intrathyroidal, a portion of the putative gland can be sent for frozen section, or an aspirate of the tissue can be diluted in a syringe containing 1 mL of saline for intraoperative PTH measurement. The presence of parathyroid tissue is confirmed if the parathyroid hormone value is greater than 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. If possible, empiric thyroidectomy should not be performed routinely without first confirming the presence of parathyroid tissue within the thyroid gland, as thyroidectomy significantly increases central neck scarring and risks devascularization of the remaining parathyroid glands. </p><p>If a hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland remains elusive despite all efforts, the procedure should be terminated. Reevaluation of the initial diagnosis and further imaging studies to localize a possible unidentified cervical or mediastinal parathyroid gland should be performed before attempting a reexploration at a later date.

Complete removal of a parathyroid gland without damaging the capsule can be achieved by gentle dissection and clipping of the vascular pedicle. Placing a large metallic clip across the parathyroid gland before cutting into the gland minimizes the risk for seeding when creating a parathyroid remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22965883\"><span class=\"h3\">Subtotal parathyroidectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subtotal parathyroidectomy removes three (or more) parathyroid glands and leaves a 20 to 40 mg remnant of the fourth (or the last remaining) gland.

Thus, bilateral transcervical thymectomy should be performed in patients undergoing parathyroid surgery for inherited HPT when less than four parathyroid glands are identified. Transcervical thymectomy is performed with blunt dissection through the existing cervical incision without the need for a sternotomy. After mobilization of the cervical portion of the thymic tongue, traction can be applied to allow for resection of at least the upper part of the thymus bilaterally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22965904\"><span class=\"h2\">Autotransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For inherited HPT patients who require autotransplantation, autografts are typically placed into the brachioradialis muscle of the nondominant forearm, rather than the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Forearm autotransplantation avoids a potential cervical reoperation in case the autograft becomes the source of recurrent HPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p>The parathyroid autograft is prepared by taking nonnodular parathyroid tissue (40 to 80 mg) and cutting it into approximately 20 pieces of 1 mm<sup>3</sup> sized fragments. A longitudinal incision is made over the brachioradialis muscle of the patient&rsquo;s nondominant arm, and the parathyroid fragments are placed within the muscle pocket(s) created by blunt dissection of the muscle. Each muscle pocket is then closed with nonabsorbable sutures after complete hemostasis. </p><p>Autografts can take up to two to four years to function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Up to 40 percent of autografts ultimately fail, leaving the patient with permanent hypoparathyroidism unless cryopreserved parathyroid tissue is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/20,21,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,39</a>].</p><p>Other complications of forearm autografting include parathyromatosis secondary to iatrogenic spillage of parathyroid tissue. Parathyromatosis can make debulking a forearm remnant technically difficult. An en bloc resection of the remnant potentially increases the risk of damaging the brachioradialis muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surrounding neurovascular bundles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22965911\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryopreservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients develop postoperative hypoparathyroidism due to either ischemic necrosis of the parathyroid remnant or early failure of an autograft. Permanent hypoparathyroidism could potentially be prevented if cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue at the time of the initial subtotal or total parathyroidectomy is performed. </p><p>There are several methods of cryopreservation. The traditional method is to place all excised parathyroid tissue in normal saline solution at 4&deg;C until the end of the operation. Tissue from the smallest and most normal appearing (least nodular) gland is then divided into pieces of 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Approximately 20 to 30 pieces are then stored in vials containing 1 mL of carrier medium (80 percent culture medium [RPMI-1640], 10 percent patient serum, and 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimethyl-sulfoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimethyl sulfoxide</a>). Using a programmable freezer, the vials are then cooled to -70&deg;C to -80&deg;C at a rate of 1&deg; per minute, and then further cooled to -196&deg;C at a rate of 20&deg;C per minute. Other methods of gradually decreasing the temperature of the parathyroid fragments have also been described. The parathyroid tissue is stored at -70&deg;C in a freezer, or at -196&deg;C in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>When delayed autografting is performed, the vials containing the cryopreserved parathyroid fragments are placed in a 37&deg;C water bath until the carrier medium is thawed. The fragments are then washed several times in RPMI-1640 at a temperature of 37&deg;C to eliminate the toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimethyl-sulfoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimethyl sulfoxide</a>. Typically, 20 fragments of parathyroid tissue are placed within brachioradialis muscle pockets after one such piece has been submitted for pathologic confirmation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526593\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative PTH monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We favor the use of intraoperative PTH monitoring for all patients undergoing parathyroid surgery. While many patients with inherited forms of HPT require bilateral exploration, intraoperative PTH monitoring may help guide the extent of resection, and may indicate the presence of supernumerary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ectopic parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/6,8,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,66</a>]. Intraoperative PTH monitoring can also allow for immediate autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue when PTH levels become too low (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>.

The optimal protocol in patients with inherited HPT syndromes is not defined. A 70 to 90 percent reduction in PTH levels has been proposed to indicate the removal of all hyperfunctioning glands in this patient population, which is more stringent than the Miami criterion (50 percent reduction) commonly used for patients with sporadic primary HPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes/abstract/20,38,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,38,74</a>].
