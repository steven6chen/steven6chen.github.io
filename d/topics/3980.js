Some clinical laboratories in the United States screen all liquid stool samples for <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, some screen bloody stools, and others screen only upon request from a treating clinician. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all stools submitted for culture be screened for <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7. However, since more than 90 percent of cultures positive for <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 come from patients with visibly bloody stools or a history of bloody diarrhea, it is reasonable to preferentially screen bloody stools for O157:H7.</p><p>Newer diagnostic techniques for EHEC infection focus on direct detection of Shiga toxins in stool, or the use of DNA probes for detecting the toxin genes in fecal isolates. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays detect both Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2 in stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Occasional false positive results occur with direct detection of Shiga toxin or toxin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, these assays do not identify the serotype of the strain, which is important for tracing the source of infection in outbreaks.

Furthermore, antibiotic treatment of EHEC has been associated with development of HUS in some studies. Given these findings, we recommend <strong>not</strong> administering antibiotic therapy to patients with EHEC infection. When EHEC is clinically suspected, we favor withholding antibiotics pending diagnostic information, particularly in children under the age of 10 years. If EHEC is isolated in patients in whom antibiotic therapy was initiated empirically, we favor discontinuing it. </p><p>Several studies have shown correlation between antibiotic use and risk of HUS, although the evidence overall is mixed and of variable quality. In a meta-analysis of mainly observational studies that included over 1800 patients with EHEC infection, there was a nonsignificant trend towards a higher risk of HUS with antibiotic use (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95% CI 0.89-1.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The association was stronger (pooled OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.45-3.36) when analysis was limited to studies that were deemed to have a low risk of bias and that had a stringent definition of HUS. One of these was a prospective study of 259 children &lt;10 years of age with <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The incubation period between exposure to EHEC and the onset of symptoms is typically three to four days (range one to nine days). Clinical manifestations may include history of bloody diarrhea, a visibly bloody stool specimen, no reported fever, a peripheral white blood cell count above <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL,</span> and abdominal tenderness. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is the major systemic complication of EHEC infection. HUS is characterized by the triad of acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and non-immune thrombocytopenia; these typically begin 5 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea. HUS generally complicates 6 to 9 percent of EHEC infections overall and about 15 percent of EHEC infections in children under age 10; for reasons that are not fully known, the incidence of HUS was substantially higher in the outbreak of <em>E. coli</em> O104:H4 infection in Europe in the summer of 2011. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hemolytic-uremic syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 in stool may be performed with sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar, as the organism ferments <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> slowly. Sorbitol-negative (translucent) colonies can be confirmed as <em>E. coli</em> biochemically and then tested for reaction with antisera to the O157 antigen. Strains presumptively identified as <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 should be sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. The likelihood of organism detection is highest in the first six days after onset of diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H6412743\" class=\"local\">'E. coli O157:H7'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct detection of toxin or toxin genes in the stool is more sensitive than SMAC agar and can also detect non-O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em> (STEC) strains; testing by both culture and toxin assay is recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The diagnosis of infection with <em>E. coli</em> O104:H4 or other non-O157 strains may be established directly (via toxin detection) or indirectly (via serologic testing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of EHEC infection consists of supportive care and monitoring for the development of microangiopathic complications. We recommend NOT administering antibiotic therapy to patients with EHEC infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For situations in which EHEC is suspected, antibiotics should be withheld pending diagnostic information, particularly in children under the age of 10. For circumstances in which antibiotic therapy was initiated empirically, it should be discontinued if diagnostic data demonstrating EHEC become available. Antibiotics have not been observed to alter the duration of acute diarrhea, can induce the expression and release of Shiga toxin, and may increase the risk of HUS in children. Antiperistaltic agents increase the risk of systemic complications and should also be avoided.
