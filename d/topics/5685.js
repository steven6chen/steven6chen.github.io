Drugs can cause thrombocytopenia by several mechanisms including direct bone marrow or other organ toxicity. Many of the cytotoxic drugs used for cancer chemotherapy and other conditions produce dose-dependent reductions in platelet counts due to bone marrow suppression as a known effect of the drug.</p><p>This topic review discusses drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP), in which the mechanism involves antibody-mediated platelet destruction caused by exposure to a drug that leads to isolated thrombocytopenia (without anemia or leukopenia). The &quot;drug&quot; in this context may be a prescribed medication (or its metabolite), over-the-counter medicine, herbal supplement, food, beverage, or other substance.</p><p>The unique thrombocytopenic drug reaction caused by heparin (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT], which we do not consider to be a form of DITP) is reviewed as a separate topic.

The finding is confirmed by repeating the platelet count using a fresh sample <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reviewing the peripheral blood smear. Typically, a sample for a repeat platelet count is drawn into a tube containing an anticoagulant other than EDTA (eg, citrate). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia#H629365\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Pseudothrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below the lower limit of normal <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;150,000/microL)</span>. Some individuals will have a stable platelet count that may be slightly lower than this value and is normal for that individual; these individuals may not require additional testing or intervention. Conversely, some individuals may have a platelet count above this value that represents a significant decrease from baseline for that individual; in such cases it is prudent to repeat the platelet count in one or two days to determine if there is a declining trend.

DITP is a form of secondary ITP.

HIT antibodies can promote thrombosis by inducing platelet activation. Patients with suspected HIT require immediate institution of a non-heparin anticoagulant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF DITP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia in DITP is caused by accelerated platelet (and rarely, megakaryocyte) destruction from drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In almost all cases, drug-dependent antiplatelet antibodies bind non-covalently to specific platelet antigens via their Fab regions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quinine</a> has been the most widely studied drug to determine the mechanism of DITP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quinine-dependent antibodies may be derived from a pool of naturally occurring antibodies that are weakly reactive with autologous proteins, such as platelet surface glycoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quinine</a>, and possibly other drugs causing DITP, can become integrated into complementarity-determining regions of these naturally occurring antibodies, creating a hybrid paratope (modified antigen-binding region) that greatly increases the antibody&rsquo;s binding affinity to platelet surface antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The phenomenon of naturally occurring antibodies may explain the observation of extremely rapid platelet count drop with some drugs such as GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors (see <a href=\"#H3919567145\" class=\"local\">'GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors'</a> below). In DITP caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a>, antibodies to murine (mouse) antigens may be responsible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another potential mechanism is that binding of the drug to the platelet surface can cause a conformational change in a surface protein that leads to exposure of a neoepitope, which in turn stimulates the formation of antiplatelet antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-dependent antibodies may have specificity for major drug metabolites as well as (or instead of) the parent drug. In a study of sulfamethoxazole-induced thrombocytopenia, 10 antibodies that reacted with intact sulfamethoxazole also reacted strongly with the N1-acetyl metabolite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar results have been obtained with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reactions that occur exclusively with a metabolite (but not the parent drug) may explain the common occurrence of negative results with drug-dependent antibody testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, for which drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies have only been identified for drug metabolites and not for the intact drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-dependent antibodies typically do not cross-react with different drugs that have a similar molecular structure (eg, they react to sulfamethoxazole but not to the nearly identical sulfisoxazole, or to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> but not the optical stereoisomer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. This may support the use of other drugs in the same class in patients with a history of DITP; however, unless the antibody specificity (and lack of cross-reactivity) is known for that particular patient, we generally do not assume other drugs of the same class will be safe. (See <a href=\"#H557598845\" class=\"local\">'Role of antibody testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2851288729\" class=\"local\">'Role of rechallenge'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some cytotoxic drugs can cause acute, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia mediated by drug-dependent antibodies in addition to causing bone marrow suppression.

Gold, which was previously used to treat certain types of arthritis, had been classically implicated in causing this syndrome. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alemtuzumab</a> is another example. In one report, 6 of 216 patients developed severe thrombocytopenia 1 to 15 months following the last dose of alemtuzumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The thrombocytopenia was responsive to traditional treatment for ITP, which resulted in prolonged remissions. In children, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has also been associated with thrombocytopenia that has the clinical characteristics of primary ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to chemotherapy drugs traditionally recognized as cytotoxic to the bone marrow, some other commonly used drugs can cause moderate, but relatively specific suppression of platelet production in the bone marrow.

However, among patients with thrombocytopenia, it is important to assess the possibility of DITP as the cause because this diagnosis has major implications for management. DITP should be suspected in a patient who presents with new onset of thrombocytopenia, especially sudden unexpected thrombocytopenia or recurrent episodes of acute thrombocytopenia without an obvious etiology.</p><p>The typical patient history includes one or more medications, herbal remedies, foods, beverages, or other substances known to cause DITP. The interval between initiation of a new drug taken daily and DITP is usually less than two weeks. A drug taken daily for several months or longer is rarely associated with DITP. Drugs taken only intermittently may cause DITP even if it has been many years since the previous exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In a 2013 systematic review of case reports limited to children, 32 substances were identified with a definite or probably causal role in thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

As an example, in a series of 12 patients with thrombocytopenia associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a>, the median interval was 6.5 days of initial continuous exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

If the patient has been sensitized by a previous exposure to the drug, the onset of thrombocytopenia may be more rapid (eg, as early as hours after exposure). Thrombocytopenia due to a GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor may occur within the first 24 hours of the initial exposure and can occur after minutes to hours (see <a href=\"#H3919567145\" class=\"local\">'GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors'</a> below). There are rare reports of thrombocytopenia caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or piperacillin occurring with the first day of exposure, but previous sensitizing exposure may have occurred in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/25,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,35</a>]. The previous exposure may have been in an unusual form, such as vancomycin in orthopedic cement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It has also been speculated that a previous exposure may have occurred due to the presence of antibiotics in foods, but we are unaware of data to support this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As noted below, most patients with DITP have prompt platelet count recovery upon drug discontinuation and a normal platelet count by one week.

These may include petechiae, purpura, mucosal bleeding (eg, epistaxis), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more serious bleeding. The likelihood of clinical bleeding depends on a number of factors including comorbidities, other medications, and platelet count. Bleeding risk is greater with DITP than with primary ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Bleeding risk generally increases with platelet counts below 40,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> but there is not a strong linear correlation between platelet count and bleeding risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the 1997 series of 309 patients with drug-induced thrombocytopenia, more serious bleeding such as gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding was seen in 12 and 3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the 1998 review of 247 patients, 23 (9 percent) had serious bleeding and two patients (1 percent) had fatal bleeding, both in association with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia has been associated with increased mortality in other series, especially in hospitalized patients; however, it may be challenging to distinguish association from causality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. As noted below, the presence of other findings, either on the complete blood count or from the history and physical examination, suggests an alternative or additional diagnosis.

Recurrent acute episodes of thrombocytopenia after drug re-exposure is strongly suggestive of DITP. Laboratory testing for drug dependent antiplatelet antibodies is often helpful but not required. (See <a href=\"#H557598845\" class=\"local\">'Role of antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p>If the patient has had previous occurrence of thrombocytopenia with previous exposure to the suspected drug, this further supports the diagnosis. However, re-exposure is not required for diagnosis should generally be avoided due to the risks of causing recurrent, severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H2851288729\" class=\"local\">'Role of rechallenge'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient evaluation is focused on identifying clues to other possible diagnoses and determining the likelihood of these other diagnoses versus DITP. For patients receiving multiple drugs, close evaluation of the timing of the drug exposure and the likelihood of DITP for each drug is especially valuable.

This is done by examining the peripheral blood smear for platelet clumping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68949 \">picture 1</a>) and repeating the platelet count. In vitro platelet clumping can occur due to incomplete mixing of the sample, or to an interaction with the anticoagulant in the sample collection tube. This is especially true for EDTA (the routine anticoagulant employed for blood counts).

In these situations, the clinical features combined with the relative risk of thrombocytopenia with each agent must be evaluated. If the patient has been exposed to heparin, the likelihood of HIT must be estimated (eg, using the 4 T's score) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H13466287\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on '4 T's score'</a>).

This testing is especially helpful for distinguishing among drugs in a patient for whom one of several drugs may be responsible, for identifying (and reporting) a new association that has not previously been reported, and in cases where re-exposure to a drug is likely and it is important to determine the need for lifelong drug avoidance. The cost is relatively low (similar to the cost of HIT antibody testing), and, unlike the situation in ITP in which antiplatelet antibody testing is not done based on a lack of correlation with clinical disease, in DITP the presence of a drug-dependent antiplatelet antibody has important implications for future drug avoidance and for reporting of new drugs not previously known to cause DITP. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>Although testing for drug-dependent antibodies is extremely helpful when the diagnosis is unclear, this testing generally is not required for diagnosis when the suspected drug has a well-established role in causing DITP. In addition, it is important to know that laboratory testing for drug-dependent antiplatelet antibodies takes several days and is not routinely available in hospital laboratories, and therefore is not helpful for making the immediate diagnosis of DITP prior to drug discontinuation; as noted above, this remains a clinical diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H1979264223\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above). The antibody testing can be performed after the drug has been discontinued, because in our experience drug-dependent antiplatelet antibodies persist for many years. An exception is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, for which testing typically is available with a faster turnaround time, and detectable antibodies generally do not persist beyond 100 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

However, in some cases rechallenge may occur inadvertently, or the drug-induced etiology may only be identified in retrospect. In such cases, recurrence of thrombocytopenia upon re-administration of the drug (or other substance) provides high quality evidence that the drug is responsible for thrombocytopenia in that patient. In the majority of patients, we use clinical assessment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> testing for drug-dependent antibodies rather than rechallenge to establish the diagnosis of DITP.

The most commonly seen alternative diagnoses are primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in asymptomatic outpatients and sepsis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in acutely ill patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary ITP</strong> &ndash; Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune condition in which antiplatelet antibodies cause thrombocytopenia that may be transient in children and may last for months to years to indefinitely in adults. Like DITP, patients with primary ITP typically present as otherwise healthy individuals who develop new onset thrombocytopenia without an obvious cause. Unlike DITP, primary ITP does not resolve when a drug is discontinued. The distinction between DITP and primary ITP is critical in order to avoid unnecessary treatment directed at ITP in a patient with a drug-induced etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

DIC may also accompany an underlying malignancy. Like individuals with drug-induced thrombocytopenia, patients with sepsis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DIC may be receiving multiple medications, some of which may be on the list of drugs that can cause thrombocytopenia; and they may have bleeding. Unlike patients with drug-induced thrombocytopenia, those with sepsis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DIC have other laboratory abnormalities indicative of a systemic infection (leukocytosis or neutropenia) and ongoing coagulation (prolonged PT and PTT, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inherited platelet disorder</strong> &ndash; Inherited platelet disorders include a number of relatively rare, genetically transmitted conditions in which platelet number, function, and morphology may be abnormal. Identification of these disorders is important to avoid needlessly exposing the patient to immunosuppressive therapies for ITP, and to alert the clinician to possible increased bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction. Like drug-induced thrombocytopenia, these conditions may be discovered incidentally, and in most cases associated hematologic or systemic manifestations are absent. Unlike drug-induced thrombocytopenia, there is no history of a normal platelet count and thrombocytopenia does not resolve upon drug discontinuation.

Like drug-induced thrombocytopenia, PTP may present as new onset severe thrombocytopenia in a patient who has been hospitalized or acutely ill. Unlike drug-induced thrombocytopenia, PTP requires a history of transfusion in the previous 7 to 10 days, and PTP responds to immunosuppressive therapy (typically, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [IVIG]).

Almost always, a substitute medication can be provided. As discussed above, this decision depends on clinical judgement regarding the degree of suspicion for DITP and the decision regarding which drug(s) are the most likely candidates.

Platelet transfusions are also appropriate and should be given to control clinically important bleeding. Steroids are often given because the distinction of DITP from ITP is often initially unclear. (See <a href=\"#H3324455803\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of bleeding/severe thrombocytopenia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3324455803\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of bleeding/severe thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe thrombocytopenia requires close communication among consulting specialists.

Higher thresholds for platelet transfusion may apply in certain settings (eg, fever, infection, GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> or other antithrombotic agent). IVIG may also be administered if platelet transfusions are ineffective in stopping bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Typically, heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> are also discontinued and heparin anticoagulation is reversed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protamine sulfate</a>.

It is appropriate to see the patient for a follow-up evaluation in another month, to be sure that the platelet count has remained normal. It is also important to review the remainder of the complete blood count (CBC), especially in patients with slow recovery, to identify any other abnormality that might develop.</p><p>However, some drugs (or drug metabolites) remain in the circulation for longer periods, and drug elimination may be further reduced in individuals with reduced metabolism due to renal or hepatic insufficiency.

Occasionally, other mechanisms including an apparently &quot;naturally occurring&quot; antibody, a primary ITP-like syndrome, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> megakaryocyte destruction may be involved.
