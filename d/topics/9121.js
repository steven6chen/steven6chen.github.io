His brother tells him that he takes a mixture of a &quot;fast&quot; and a &quot;slow&quot; insulin. The patient asks that his medical records be sent to his brother's clinician.</p><p>The approach that you recommended, with lispro insulin before supper and glargine insulin at bedtime, was reasonable and well-tailored to the needs of this patient. However, this is not the only possible approach. It is often helpful to accommodate to the patient's lifestyle and preferences if possible.</p><p>The important decision at this point is to start insulin. This can be done in several different ways (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interactive-diabetes-case-2-switching-from-oral-agents-to-insulin-in-type-2-diabetes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interactive diabetes case 2: Switching from oral agents to insulin in type 2 diabetes&quot;</a>). While mixed insulin preparations do not allow you to vary the short-acting or very-short-acting premeal insulin dose and the intermediate-acting basal insulin dose separately, they are often effective. The mixture of a very-short-acting insulin and an intermediate-acting insulin given before supper in this patient is appropriate to the patient's lifestyle, which includes a large meal at supper.</p><p>Return to the previous choice to try again.
