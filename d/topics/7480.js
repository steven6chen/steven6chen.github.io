It causes learning and behavior problems, and certain body features. It can also cause certain medical problems.</p><p>Fragile X syndrome is caused by a problem with a gene on the &quot;X&quot; chromosome. Chromosomes are tiny parts of cells that carry the plans (genes) that make our bodies the way they are. Fragile X syndrome happens more often in boys than girls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612644500\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of fragile X syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can be different in different people. Girls with fragile X syndrome often have milder symptoms than boys. In fact, many girls have no symptoms at all. That's because girls have 2 &quot;X&quot; chromosomes in each of their cells, while boys only have 1. So if one &quot;X&quot; has a problem, girls still have another &quot;X&quot; that is normal.</p><p>People with fragile X syndrome might have the following body features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A head that is bigger than normal (in children)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crossed eyes, which is when the eyes don't line up or look in the same direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74106 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Big ears and eyes that look &quot;sunken in&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loose joints, such as in the thumbs, fingers, or wrists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicles that are bigger than normal (in male teens and adults) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Fragile X syndrome causes learning and behavior problems. Babies with fragile X syndrome can take longer to sit, walk, or talk (called &quot;developmental delay&quot;). Many people with fragile X syndrome have intellectual disability with a low IQ. This used to be called &quot;mental retardation.&quot; It is more common in boys than girls.</p><p>Children with fragile X syndrome can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble with problem solving and organization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have problems with language and speaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble sitting still, paying attention, or making good decisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel very worried or sad</p><p/><p>Fragile X syndrome also sometimes causes certain medical problems. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures, which are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can make people pass out or move or behave strangely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble with the way a woman's ovaries (reproductive organs) work (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tremor, which is when the hand shakes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612644515\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for fragile X syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for fragile X syndrome, your doctor or nurse will do an exam, ask about symptoms, and ask whether other family members have the condition. He or she will also order a blood test to check for the abnormal gene.</p><p>Children and adults can be tested for fragile X syndrome if they have symptoms of the condition. People can also be tested for fragile X syndrome if they have a family member with the condition. Pregnant women might also choose to test their unborn baby for the condition, if it runs in the family.</p><p>Children who are diagnosed with fragile X syndrome will need further tests. These include tests to check their thinking, learning, and behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612644530\"><span class=\"h1\">How is fragile X syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on a person's symptoms and individual situation. It usually involves 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A school plan &ndash; Depending on your child's learning problems, the school will make a learning plan for your child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior therapy &ndash; This involves making changes at home or at school to help with your child's behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech, language, physical, or occupational therapy &ndash; Specialists can help with your child's language and the way he or she moves or does everyday activities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; The doctor might recommend that your child take medicine. Some medicines help children sit still and pay attention. Others help when children feel very worried or sad. Children who have seizures are treated with medicines called anti-seizure medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular follow-ups with the doctor &ndash; The doctor will see your child on a regular basis. That way, he or she can do exams and tests to monitor your child for medical problems that can happen in children with fragile X syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612644545\"><span class=\"h1\">Should other family members be tested for fragile X syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or your child is diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, let your family members know. They should talk with their doctor about getting tested for the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612644560\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start trying. He or she will probably recommend that you speak with a genetic counselor (a person who specializes in genetic conditions).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612644575\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I learn more about fragile X syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To learn more, talk with your child's doctor or nurse.
