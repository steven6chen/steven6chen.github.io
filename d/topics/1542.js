Each of the core symptoms of ADHD has its own pattern and course of development. The complaint regarding symptoms of ADHD may originate from the parents, teachers, or other caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperactivity and impulsivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperactive and impulsive behaviors almost always occur together in young children.

After seven to eight years of age, hyperactive symptoms begin to decline; by the adolescent years, they may be barely discernible to observers, although the adolescent may feel restless or unable to settle down. In contrast, impulsive symptoms usually persist throughout life.

As an example, adolescents with ADHD who are untreated and in an environment where alcohol and other commonly abused substances are readily available are at greater risk of engaging in drug use or experimentation than are adolescents without ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Inattention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to focus attention and reduced speed of cognitive processing and responding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

The typical presenting complaints center on cognitive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> academic problems. Among children born at &lt;32 weeks gestational age, symptoms of inattention appear to be more prominent than hyperactivity and impulsivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This delay may relate to reduced sensitivity of assessment of attention problems or increased variability in the normal development of the cognitive skills. Similar to the pattern of impulsivity, symptoms of inattention usually are a lifelong problem.

Social skills in children with ADHD often are significantly impaired. Problems with inattention may limit opportunities to acquire social skills or to attend to social cues necessary for effective social interaction, making it difficult to form friendships.

It is important to discuss safety and injury prevention at each visit because children with ADHD or symptoms of ADHD are at increased risk of intentional and unintentional injury compared with children without these symptoms.
