VP has also been called porphyria variegata, South African genetic porphyria, mixed porphyria (an obsolete term also applied to hereditary coproporphyria [HCP]), protocoproporphyria, and porphyria cutanea tarda hereditaria (which likely included some cases of familial porphyria cutanea tarda [PCT]). The spectrum of disease manifestations is broad, ranging from life-threatening neurovisceral attacks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic blistering skin lesions to patients who remain asymptomatic throughout their lives.</p><p>It is especially important to make an accurate diagnosis of VP in symptomatic individuals with neurovisceral or cutaneous manifestations in order to provide appropriate treatment. The acute neurovisceral attacks can be life threatening, and are treated in the same manner as other acute porphyrias. The skin manifestations are identical to PCT, congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; especially mild cases), hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), and hereditary coproporphyria. These porphyrias are readily differentiated by well-chosen biochemical studies.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of VP will be discussed here.</p><p>Other porphyrias, as well as a general overview, are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overview</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HCP</strong> (cutaneous and neurovisceral manifestations) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-coproporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary coproporphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>AIP</strong> (neurovisceral) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-intermittent-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute intermittent porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ADP</strong> (neurovisceral) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ala-dehydratase-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ALA dehydratase porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PCT and HEP</strong> (cutaneous) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>EPP</strong> (cutaneous) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CEP</strong> (cutaneous) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital erythropoietic porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6523550\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3291379437\"><span class=\"h2\">PPOX gene mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VP is an autosomal dominant condition caused by heterozygosity for a protoporphyrinogen oxidase (<em>PPOX; </em><a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/600923&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWJyKMdR0dgPZXScU0xUMM9/85XPVpf3EggkXT8Dm3TvZ&amp;TOPIC_ID=7126\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">OMIM 600923</a>) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PPOX encodes the seventh enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>). Over 140 different <em>PPOX </em>mutations have been identified following what was probably the initial description of the disease in 1937 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Genotype-phenotype relationships have been reported in some smaller studies, but these correlations are less evident in larger studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p>In South Africa, about 95 percent of VP cases are due to the R59W missense <em>PPOX</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This founder mutation was carried from Holland by one of two immigrants to South Africa who were married in the late 1600s. Initial speculations that King George III of England and others in the royal houses of Europe had VP (&quot;the Royal malady&quot;) were subsequently discounted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H712078067\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p><em>PPOX</em> mutations found in VP families abolish or nearly abolish enzymatic activity of PPOX, which oxidizes protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 2</a>). Heterozygotes have approximately 50 percent of normal PPOX activity in all cells, largely reflecting the enzymatic activity produced by the normal <em>PPOX</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This reduced enzymatic activity, along with induction of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), cause accumulation of protoporphyrinogen IX within hepatocytes. The excess protoporphyrinogen IX is mostly auto-oxidized to protoporphyrin IX and is found in plasma before excretion in the bile and feces.</p><p>Cutaneous manifestations of VP occur because excess protoporphyrin IX is transported in plasma to the skin, where it becomes photoactivated by light, especially with wavelengths in the range of 380 to 420 nm (the Soret band), which overlaps the intersection of long-wave ultraviolet (UVA) and visible light. This leads to the release of reactive oxygen species that damage skin cells. (See <a href=\"#H2260948200\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Neurovisceral symptoms in VP are believed chiefly to be related to accumulation of the earlier heme pathway intermediates delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), as in other acute hepatic porphyrias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Excess ALA is considered the most likely cause of neurotoxic effects in this and other acute porphyrias, although heme deficiency in neuronal or vascular tissue is an additional or alternative potential mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H660106\" class=\"local\">'Neurovisceral symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Biochemical findings in acute VP attacks such as elevations in coproporphyrin III as well as protoporphyrin IX may occur because PPOX and coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) are closely associated in the mitochondrial membrane; in VP, this interaction may reduce CPOX activity leading to accumulation of coproporphyrinogen III, which is auto-oxidized to coproporphyrin III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Elevated ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG) in plasma and urine may result in part from inhibition of hepatic porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) by protoporphyrinogen IX and coproporphyrinogen III, which accumulate in the liver, and from upregulation of <em>ALAS1</em> by exacerbating factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Very rarely, an individual may be homozygous or compound heterozygous for <em>PPOX</em> mutations, either through consanguinity or by inheritance of two different <em>PPOX</em> mutations, one from each unrelated parent. At least one of the mutant alleles must express some enzymatic activity; complete loss of PPOX function is incompatible with life. Homozygotes and compound heterozygotes present early in childhood with impaired development and severe cutaneous photosensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H660099\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24936245\"><span class=\"h2\">Exacerbating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described below, cutaneous manifestations of VP result from high plasma porphyrin levels and exposure of the skin to light with wavelengths in the range of 380 to 420 nm (UVA-visible light intersection). These wavelengths, which are not removed when light passes through window glass, photoactivate porphyrins in skin capillaries or cells, with release of activated oxygen species that damage cells. Sunlight and to a lesser extent artificial lights that include these wavelengths can cause skin damage in VP and other cutaneous porphyrias. (See <a href=\"#H2260948200\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>As with other acute hepatic porphyrias, neurovisceral symptoms in VP can be exacerbated by certain drugs and steroid hormones (especially progesterone), as well as alcohol, cigarette smoke, and fasting or metabolic stress. This occurs through induction of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (ALAS1), the rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis in the liver, and induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which increases the demand for heme synthesis in the liver. Both ALAS1 and certain hepatic CYP genes respond to inducing chemicals that are ligands for the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and other nuclear receptors, which then bind to sites in the promoter regions of <em>ALAS1</em> and CYPs and upregulate gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drugs</strong> &ndash; A partial listing of potentially unsafe drugs in VP and other acute porphyrias is included in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 1</a>). Most of the unsafe agents (eg, barbiturates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, most other antiepileptics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>) induce hepatic ALAS1 and CYPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Clinicians considering medications in patients with VP should consult frequently updated sources for information regarding medication safety, such as the websites of the American Porphyria Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.porphyriafoundation.com/&amp;token=DXiNnVb2ZFrySDKpmM7piEpVAnOmMg/hENsp80iGuZ5qTNHOLQI0S8f/nFKYbrsC&amp;TOPIC_ID=7126\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.porphyriafoundation.com</a>) and the European Porphyria Network (<a href=\"http://www.porphyria-europe.com/&amp;token=DXiNnVb2ZFrySDKpmM7piK0vep3FDAp2O059vsC/rJYMZc11DOZNo4Fc7u3H5RAB&amp;TOPIC_ID=7126\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.porphyria-europe.com</a>). Of note, the evidence for these listings is often limited and sometimes controversial or even contradictory, and it is useful to consult an expert center for advice, particularly for patients with frequent attacks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormones</strong> &ndash; Increases in sex hormones at puberty and cyclic progesterone production in ovulating women contribute to the onset of symptoms in some heterozygotes. Unknown modifying gene variants may be present in those who develop symptoms, and these variants may be absent in the majority of adult heterozygotes who never develop symptoms. Oral contraceptives may exacerbate symptoms in acute porphyrias because progestins are inducers of ALAS1 and CYPs, and in VP in particular estrogens may impair hepatobiliary excretion of porphyrins and increase plasma porphyrin levels and photosensitivity. Pregnancy is usually well tolerated, but attacks become more frequent in some pregnant women with acute porphyria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alcohol and cigarette smoke</strong> &ndash; Alcohol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke can induce ALAS1 and CYPs and contribute to the development of acute attacks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Fasting/metabolic</span> stress</strong> &ndash; Reduced food intake, for example during crash dieting or after bariatric surgery, can lead to attacks; in this setting, ALAS1 is induced in the liver by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1-alpha, a member of a family of transcription coactivators that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism. PGC-1-alpha is increased by starvation and glucagon and decreased by glucose and insulin. Metabolic stress due to concurrent medical conditions or surgery may also precipitate acute neurovisceral attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H712078067\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VP occurs worldwide. The prevalence is not accurately known because many individuals with <em>PPOX</em> mutations remain asymptomatic.</p><p>The prevalence of symptomatic VP has been estimated at 0.3 per 100,000 in Europe (approximately 1 in 300,000). Some countries such as Finland may have a higher prevalence of VP (1.3 in 100,000; equivalent to approximately 1 in 77,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. By comparison, more common porphyrias such as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) have prevalences on the order of approximately 1 in 5000 to 1 in 25,000, depending on the population.</p><p>The prevalence of VP is high in South Africans of Dutch descent; an incidence as high as 1 in 300 has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/6,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,23</a>]. This occurred because a Dutch ancestor carried the <em>PPOX</em> founder mutation R59W and the population expanded greatly while remaining quite isolated for many decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. As many as 30,000 such individuals in South Africa carry this protoporphyrin oxidase (<em>PPOX)</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3291379437\" class=\"local\">'PPOX gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H660099\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features of VP are variable, and may include chronic blistering cutaneous lesions on light-exposed skin and acute neurovisceral attacks of abdominal pain and neuropathic extremity pain and weakness. Skin manifestations are generally chronic and more common than neurovisceral symptoms, which are typically acute and intermittent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2,13,22,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,22,28</a>]. Overall, acute attacks are less severe and frequent than in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), but nonetheless can be severe and life threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The typical age of presentation is after puberty, during adolescence or early adulthood. Women are more commonly symptomatic for both skin and neurovisceral symptoms than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Many individuals with a <em>PPOX</em> mutation (eg, as identified by family screening) are entirely asymptomatic throughout life. These individuals are referred to as having latent disease. (See <a href=\"#H660179\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>Very rarely, an individual may have homozygous or compound heterozygous <em>PPOX</em> mutations; these individuals may present in childhood with severe cutaneous photosensitivity and severe neurologic manifestations, but seldom have acute neurovisceral attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2260948200\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous manifestations are chronic and are one of the most common manifestations of VP; they are seen in 10 to 50 percent of affected individuals. Many patients with VP have only skin findings without neurovisceral symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,13</a>]. Cutaneous symptoms may be more common in countries such as South Africa where there are longer periods of intense sun exposure than in northern European countries such as Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2,13,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,21,22</a>]. Compared with hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), the other acute hepatic porphyria associated with both cutaneous and neurovisceral symptoms, VP is much more likely to be associated with cutaneous findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Skin manifestations result from increased friability and typically include vesicles and bullae, erosions or ulcers that often crust over and are slow to heal, scarring, areas of increased or decreased pigmentation and milia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2,21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,28</a>]. These changes occur on sun-exposed areas of skin such as the dorsal hands and forearms, legs and feet (if exposed), neck, ears, and face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108944\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108944 \">picture 1</a>). Hypertrichosis of the face and forearms may occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83390\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83390 \">picture 2</a>). These findings are indistinguishable from other cutaneous blistering porphyrias, the most common being porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). (See <a href=\"#H1637218101\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Sunlight is the strongest source of light-causing photoactivation of porphyrins; however, any source of light that contains wavelengths capable of activating porphyrins (eg, fluorescent lights) may contribute to phototoxicity. Maximum absorption and photoactivation of porphyrins occurs at about 400 nm (a light absorption peak called the Soret band) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Wavelengths of light in this range can pass through standard window glass and automobile windshields.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H660106\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovisceral symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurovisceral symptoms are a feature of VP but are less common than cutaneous manifestations; only about 10 percent of patients with VP are estimated to develop an acute neurovisceral attack in their lifetimes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When they occur, acute neurovisceral attacks are indistinguishable from those of other acute porphyrias, although on average they may be somewhat milder than in AIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/2,13,21,22,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,21,22,28</a>]. While neurovisceral findings are highly variable, individuals who have recurrent acute attacks often have similar symptoms from one attack to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Neurovisceral findings during acute attacks are nonspecific and may include abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation; pain may also occur in the back, chest, and extremities. Abdominal pain can be unremitting for hours or more, poorly localized, and associated with cramping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There is often little or no tenderness or other peritoneal signs. However, there may be abdominal distention from intestinal ileus, and bladder paresis with urinary retention. Bowel intussusception has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Additional common <span class=\"nowrap\">autonomic/neuropsychiatric</span> findings during attacks include systemic arterial hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, disorientation, and agitation. Psychotic features may be present. Some of these findings may reflect autonomic dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation. Motor neuropathy may lead to neuromuscular weakness, and patients are at risk for quadriparesis and respiratory failure.</p><p>Seizures may be a direct neurologic manifestation of porphyria or due to hyponatremia often resulting from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;</a>). Hyponatremia may result in part from vomiting and renal sodium loss.</p><p>During acute attacks, patients may have brown or reddish urine (the term porphyria is derived from the Greek word for the color purple, &quot;porphyrus&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]).

As with other acute neurovisceral porphyrias, chronic mild increases in liver function tests, especially transaminases, may be seen in patients with persistent elevations of ALA, PBG, and porphyrins, suggesting ongoing chronic liver disease. It has also been suggested that patients with VP have an increased risk of hepatic cirrhosis and gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal</strong> &ndash; Individuals with VP and other acute porphyrias are also at risk for chronic renal failure, and may require long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation.

In the setting of signs and symptoms consistent with an acute porphyria attack (see <a href=\"#H660106\" class=\"local\">'Neurovisceral symptoms'</a> above), demonstration of elevated urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) is sufficient to make a diagnosis of acute porphyria and initiate treatment. Additional biochemical testing, including plasma and fecal porphyrins, can then be performed to distinguish between VP and other acute porphyrias. Genetic testing is <strong>not</strong> used to diagnose an acute attack because it detects, but cannot distinguish between, both latent and active disease.

Such individuals are counseled on how to avoid exacerbations of VP, and to inform their doctors that they have a <em>PPOX</em> mutation and thereby hasten a diagnosis if future symptoms occur. (See <a href=\"#H1045410969\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic relatives'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Once a biochemical diagnosis is made, we perform genetic testing to identify the specific familial <em>PPOX</em> mutation.

(See <a href=\"#H660179\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>Assays of PPOX activity in cells that have mitochondria, such as circulating lymphocytes or cultured fibroblasts or lymphocytes, are also useful for confirming a diagnosis of VP, but these are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4592974\"><span class=\"h2\">New patient, acute attack</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VP or another type of acute porphyria should be considered, even when the index of suspicion is not high, such as in a patient who presents with acute neurovisceral symptoms (abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric or autonomic symptoms) for whom there is not an alternative explanation after an initial workup for more common conditions. The presenting findings are nonspecific and can be quite variable, and the diagnosis of acute porphyria is often made even when it is not strongly suspected. Screening is important because early diagnosis and treatment can avert long-term and life-threatening complications.</p><p>Previous similar and recurrent symptoms may or may not have occurred. Importantly, however, a negative family history is not helpful in excluding the diagnosis of VP, because penetrance is low and symptom onset in those who become affected is variable.</p><p>For effective management, the presence of an acute porphyria must be established as quickly as possible before treatment is initiated, to facilitate rapid and appropriate treatment and to ensure that treatment, which may lower levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), PBG, and porphyrins, does not obscure the correct diagnosis. As with other acute porphyrias, the preferred approach for VP is measuring urine PBG and total porphyrins as <span class=\"nowrap\">first-line/screening</span> tests, and more extensive second-line testing, to include plasma and fecal porphyrins, if screening testing is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61709\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef61709 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4592904\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary PBG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial laboratory evaluation for acute porphyria in a patient in the midst of an acute attack is done by testing urine for porphobilinogen (PBG) on a spot urine sample. A kit for demonstration of a substantial PBG elevation in a spot urine sample is valuable for rapid (qualitative) testing; however, such a kit is not widely available. If PBG testing is not available on-site for rapid diagnosis, a urine sample should be sent to a laboratory and an urgent result requested. Since a randomly collected urine sample may be dilute, it is strongly advised to express the result per gram or micromol of creatinine.</p><p>A positive spot urine test for a substantially elevated PBG level (eg, at least 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> or, if the urine is dilute, at least 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine) confirms a diagnosis of acute porphyria. If symptoms are consistent with an acute attack and other causes of the acute symptoms are excluded or considered unlikely, the finding of a substantially elevated PBG is sufficient to initiate therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> in an acutely ill patient (see <a href=\"#H6524408\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute attacks'</a> below). PBG can be measured in serum if acute porphyria is suspected in a patient with advanced renal disease. After finding a substantial PBG elevation, therapy should <strong>not</strong> be delayed or withheld while waiting for additional testing to determine the specific type of acute porphyria. However, spot samples (urine, blood, and feces) for this subsequent testing should be obtained at the time of the acute attack and before therapy is initiated. Collection of a 24-hour urine or a timed fecal collection is not necessary and can delay treatment.</p><p>Samples collected at the time of the acute attack have the greatest likelihood of providing a clear diagnosis. Samples collected later may be less abnormal as the attack regresses, and treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> can greatly lower levels of porphyrin precursors and porphyrins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H414675442\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional biochemical testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with elevated urinary PBG, additional biochemical testing should be done to determine the type of acute porphyria (ie, to distinguish VP from AIP and HCP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 2</a>). This is done by testing spot samples of urine, plasma, and feces collected at the time of the acute attack and before treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a>. However, as noted above, therapy for the acute attack is similar regardless of the type of acute porphyria and thus should <strong>not </strong>be delayed while awaiting results of this testing.</p><p>Test requests must be specific. For example, because ALA and PBG are an amino acid and a pyrrole, respectively, and not porphyrins, these must be ordered specifically, and may not be measured if only porphyrins are requested. Ordering a &quot;porphyrin screen&quot; or &quot;porphyrin profile&quot; may lead to rejection of the request or to undesired results, as these are not specific tests.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urine</strong> &ndash; Urine is sent for quantitative measurement of PBG, ALA, and porphyrins. Testing the same urine sample used for initial PBG testing is preferable to testing a new spot sample or a 24-hour collection, because these metabolites may decrease as the acute attack is treated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resolves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Measuring creatinine in the spot urine sample is strongly recommended because this allows results to be expressed per gram or per micromol of creatinine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">VP is associated with elevated urinary PBG, ALA, and porphyrins (especially coproporphyrin III). Elevations of PBG and ALA are often less marked and more transient in VP than in AIP (see <a href=\"#H1637218101\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Elevations in total urinary porphyrins persist longer in VP than do elevations in ALA and PBG, with the caveat that urinary porphyrin elevations are much less specific than elevations in PBG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/10,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,39</a>]. Fractionation of urinary porphyrins usually is not informative. If done, it will usually show a predominance of coproporphyrin III, but some patients may have substantial proportions of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin that suggest porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plasma</strong> &ndash; Plasma is sent primarily for measurement of porphyrins. With normal renal function, ALA and PBG are lower in plasma than in urine, so urine measurements are more sensitive. However, in active cases of VP, plasma porphyrins are increased with a distinctive fluorescence peak at approximately 626 nm with dilution at neutral pH, which distinguishes VP from all other porphyrias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In active VP, fecal porphyrins are increased markedly, with a predominance of both coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin IX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Red blood cells</strong> &ndash; Testing enzymatic activity in red blood cells (erythrocytes) is not relevant for the diagnosis of VP, because PPOX, the deficient enzyme in VP, is a mitochondrial enzyme and erythrocytes lack mitochondria. If performed, erythrocyte PBG deaminase activity is normal in VP and decreased in most patients with AIP (see <a href=\"#H1637218101\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Erythrocyte porphyrins may be elevated, but not substantially, in VP, HCP, and AIP.</p><p/><p>While not required to initiate therapy for the acute attack, it is important to distinguish VP from other porphyrias for the purpose of subsequent treatment and potentially for genetic testing and evaluation of first degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/10,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4593133\"><span class=\"h2\">New patient, skin-only findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with VP will only have cutaneous findings. However, close questioning of such patients may reveal past or even current symptoms that suggest neurovisceral involvement as well. The diagnosis of VP in patients with current skin findings is made by analyzing plasma (or serum) or spot urine porphyrins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89035\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035 \">algorithm 2</a>). In VP, this testing will show an increase in plasma porphyrins with the distinctive fluorescence peak at approximately 626 to 628 nm at neutral pH; increases in urinary porphyrins (predominantly coproporphyrin III in most cases); and increases in fecal porphyrins (predominantly coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin IX) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a>). However, the urine porphyrin pattern can resemble that seen in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These porphyrin elevations in VP are substantial and persistent together with the chronic blistering skin manifestations. Urinary ALA and PBG may also be elevated but levels of these porphyrin precursors may be normal, especially in the absence of an acute neurovisceral attack.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If plasma and urinary porphyrins are not elevated, VP (and other blistering cutaneous porphyrias) are excluded as the cause of the skin lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If plasma, urinary, and fecal porphyrins are elevated in a patient with blistering skin lesions, it is important to distinguish VP from other blistering cutaneous porphyrias, because their treatments differ, and neurovisceral manifestations will be seen only in those with VP or hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). In particular, VP must be differentiated from PCT, which is much more common, based on biochemical findings, because there is a risk of developing neuropathic manifestations in VP but not PCT, and PCT is effectively treated by phlebotomy or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, whereas VP and other porphyrias do not respond to such treatment. Biochemical differences are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a>). Fluorescence scanning of diluted plasma at neutral pH is especially useful as a specific marker for VP and for excluding PCT and other blistering cutaneous porphyrias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>Skin biopsy is not required for diagnosis of VP, because histological findings are the same as in PCT and other blistering cutaneous porphyrias, but may be performed as part of the evaluation for other dermatologic diagnoses.

The most sensitive biochemical tests for VP during asymptomatic stages are plasma porphyrins (including a fluorescence scan) and fecal porphyrins. If results are normal, the testing can be repeated in the future if symptoms recur. Genetic testing is an option, but is generally not recommended in this setting and would require sequencing of the genes for <span class=\"nowrap\">PBGD/HMBS</span> and CPOX in addition to PPOX.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1045410969\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic relatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis or exclusion of latent VP in asymptomatic relatives of a patient with VP and a known disease-causing <em>PPOX</em> mutation is occurring more frequently as genetic testing is more widely used for diagnosis. Individuals with latent VP can benefit from taking precautions to avoid attacks, and from prompt diagnosis of overt VP should symptoms occur. Such testing should begin with first degree relatives, followed by testing of offspring of those identified to have inherited the familial <em>PPOX</em> mutation. Individuals to be screened should be informed that positive test results may cause anxiety and worry, and if results are disclosed might affect employment and insurance eligibility, where legislative or other protections against such discrimination are not in force.

The presentation of an acute attack is often similar to previous attacks. However, the possibility of another cause of abdominal pain or other symptoms should always be considered. Demonstration of an increase in urinary PBG over baseline is desirable. However, quantitative PBG results are seldom rapidly available, and multiple test results during asymptomatic periods are required to establish a meaningful baseline.

Pseudoporphyria causes the same type of blistering on sun exposed areas as PCT and VP, but in the absence of significant porphyrin elevations. Pseudoporphyria can sometimes be attributed to drugs such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or an antibiotic. Other blistering cutaneous diseases typically are not confined to sun-exposed areas of skin and show histopathological features that are different from blistering cutaneous porphyrias.

Like VP, HCP can also have blistering cutaneous symptoms. These other neurovisceral porphyrias have different biochemical patterns of urine and plasma ALA, PBG, and porphyrins that distinguish them from VP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60572 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 2</a>).

Therefore, an elevated PBG is diagnostic for VP, HCP, or AIP, but does not exclude other causes of abdominal pain, and the presence of another cause of abdominal pain does not exclude VP (or other acute porphyrias).

Finding the familial <em>PPOX</em> mutation identifies a relative who is at risk to develop clinical manifestations of VP. Genetic testing of relatives can occur at any age, although the risk of symptoms is very low until after puberty. Amniocentesis to obtain fetal cells for DNA studies is not advised because the prognosis of offspring who inherit a <em>PPOX</em> mutation is generally favorable, and therefore termination of pregnancy is not often considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/variegate-porphyria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Heterozygotes for a familial <em>PPOX</em> mutation who are asymptomatic are advised to avoid factors that can exacerbate acute porphyrias (see <a href=\"#H24936245\" class=\"local\">'Exacerbating factors'</a> above), although they are at lower risk than those who have previously had symptoms. These individuals should be counseled regarding avoidance of medications and other exposures to reduce the risk of developing symptoms, including avoidance of heavy alcohol use and smoking.

(See <a href=\"#H1045410969\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic relatives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of VP includes other cutaneous and acute neurovisceral porphyrias, other causes of blistering skin lesions, other causes of abdominal pain and neuropathy, and other causes of elevated porphyrin levels. (See <a href=\"#H1637218101\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute attacks in VP are potentially life threatening if not recognized promptly and managed appropriately. For patients with VP (or other acute porphyria) with a severe acute attack (defined as requiring hospitalization, opioid analgesia, or other intravenous medication; or accompanied by nausea and vomiting, motor neuropathy, paresis, seizures, agitation, delirium, psychosis, ileus that prevents oral intake, or hyponatremia), we recommend intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). This recommendation is based on the high risk of life-threatening sequelae from a severe acute porphyria attack and the apparent efficacy and safety of hemin based on observational data; however, prospective randomized clinical trials are lacking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We also suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hemin</a> for attacks that are less severe (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Intravenous or oral glucose are reasonable alternatives in patients with mild attacks; however, the response with hemin is likely to be faster than with glucose, and mild attacks are more likely to become more severe if not treated initially with hemin. For all patients, potentially harmful drugs should be discontinued (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 1</a>); metabolic stresses should be corrected; and pain, nausea, and autonomic symptoms should be treated. (See <a href=\"#H6524408\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with blistering skin lesions of VP should wear protective clothing to avoid exposure to sunlight and development of more lesions. Affected areas should be kept clean and skin infections treated with antibiotics. Pain may require analgesic treatment, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, or opioid analgesics. Topical steroids should be avoided. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hemin</a> and glucose loading are short-term therapies and not effective for treating chronic cutaneous manifestations of VP. (See <a href=\"#H24936608\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment of skin lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential long-term complications of VP include renal disease, liver function test abnormalities, and hepatocellular cancer. Recommendations for screening and monitoring are described above. (See <a href=\"#H6524431\" class=\"local\">'Screening for long-term complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform gene sequencing for <em>PPOX</em> mutations in all patients with a biochemical diagnosis of VP, to be used for additional diagnostic confirmation, for identification of previously undescribed mutations, and to facilitate genetic counseling and testing of family members.
