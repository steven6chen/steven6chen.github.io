As examples, macular and lichen amyloidosis are skin-limited diseases with no potential for visceral involvement.

In a series of 794 Chinese patients with primary cutaneous amyloidosis (primarily lichenoid, biphasic, and macular amyloidosis), 7 percent had a positive family history of cutaneous amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Degeneration of basal keratinocytes in the overlying epidermis likely plays a role. In one theory, cytokeratin released from apoptotic basal keratinocytes is covered with autoantibodies, phagocytosed by macrophages, and enzymatically degraded to form amyloid K [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, sweat gland or sweat duct dysfunction leading to leakage of sweat into the dermoepidermal junction, an inflammatory response, epidermal damage, and amyloid deposition has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism for lichen amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A cycle of chronic pruritus and scratching may contribute to amyloid production and deposition.

Typical sites of involvement are the upper back (scapula region) and extensor surfaces of extremities. Macular amyloidosis is usually, but not always, pruritic. </p><p>Lichen amyloidosis is pruritic and appears as discrete, skin-colored to hyperpigmented, scaly, domed, 2 to 4 mm papules that coalesce to form persistent plaques with a rippled appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109622%7EDERM%2F109623%7EDERM%2F109624%7EDERM%2F94971%7EDERM%2F94969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109622 graphicRef109623 graphicRef109624 graphicRef94971 graphicRef94969 \">picture 2A-E</a>). The plaques are most commonly found on the extensor surfaces, such as the shins. Lichen amyloidosis usually begins unilaterally but may progress to symmetric involvement. Bullae occur in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The typical anatomic locations for lichen amyloidosis may correlate with areas that can be easily scratched or rubbed. Patients with pretibial lichen amyloidosis often acknowledge chronic rubbing of the heel of the contralateral leg along the shin. </p><p>Some patients exhibit overlapping features of macular and lichen amyloidosis.

In both macular amyloidosis and lichen amyloidosis, small globules of pink material (amyloid) are present in the superficial dermis, mostly in dermal papillae between epidermal rete ridges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94972\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94972 \">picture 1C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The overlying epidermis may demonstrate degeneration of basal keratinocytes with cytoplasmic vacuolization. Pigment incontinence is also common, with admixed melanophages, which may have a dendritic morphology. </p><p>In addition, lichen amyloidosis demonstrates hyperkeratosis and epidermal acanthosis that may resemble lichen simplex chronicus. The epidermis of macular amyloidosis typically appears normal. </p><p>Amyloid deposition is not present around blood vessel walls or deeper in the dermis in either disorder, and plasma cells are generally not increased in affected skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

There is often a history of pruritus and scratching in the affected area. </p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of amyloid with a skin biopsy. A punch biopsy is the preferred type of biopsy.

The pruritus is usually unilateral and may be in a dermatomal distribution. Hyperpigmentation often occurs secondary to scratching or rubbing the skin. Amyloid deposits are not a primary histologic feature of notalgia paresthetica; however, chronic scratching of the affected area may contribute to the development of associated macular amyloidosis.

As with lichen amyloidosis, the itch-scratch cycle plays an important role in development. Prurigo nodularis is commonly associated with other pruritic skin disorders, such as atopic dermatitis.

The shins are common sites for this disorder. A distinctive histologic finding of lichen planus is a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis.

No treatment is consistently effective or curative. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First-line therapy </strong>&ndash; Given the benign nature of these disorders, a conservative initial approach to treatment is preferred. Clinical experience suggests that interventions to break the itch-scratch cycle can be helpful.

In addition, a potent (group 1 or 2) topical corticosteroid can be applied once or twice daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>). For thick plaques of lichen amyloidosis, the topical corticosteroid can be applied under occlusion to augment drug penetration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is no improvement after one month, topical corticosteroid therapy should be discontinued. Cutaneous atrophy is a potential side effect of topical corticosteroid use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical experience suggests that intralesional corticosteroid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> can be a useful alternative to topical corticosteroid therapy for patients with small, localized areas of lichen amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-amyloidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As with topical corticosteroids, there is a risk of cutaneous atrophy.
