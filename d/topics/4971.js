Some of the things that can cause skin allergies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines, perfumes, or cosmetics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metal in some kinds of jewelry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plants, such as poison ivy and poison oak</p><p/><p>Sometimes you can develop a rash the first time you touch something. But it is also possible to get a rash from something you have used before without any problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478263879\"><span class=\"h1\">What other symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a rash, your skin might be red, dry, itchy, or cracked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F108644\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108644 \">picture 1</a>). If your rash is caused by an allergy, you might also have some swelling or blisters where you have the rash.</p><p>Severe symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Widespread swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large blisters, oozing, or crusting of the skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478263886\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to get rid of my dermatitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using or touching whatever might have caused your rash</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protect your skin from anything that might irritate it or cause an allergy. For example, wear gloves if you need to work with harsh soaps.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try using soothing skin products to help with the itching and discomfort. Things that might help include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unscented, thick moisturizing cream</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A special kind of bath called an oatmeal bath</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478263893\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if your rash does not go away within 2 weeks, or if it gets worse. Your doctor can help figure out what could be causing your rash.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478263900\"><span class=\"h1\">How are skin rashes treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might prescribe different treatments or medicines to help your rash. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid creams and ointments</strong> &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. They go on the skin, and they relieve itching and redness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid pills</strong> &ndash; You might need to take these for a short time if your rash is severe. But your doctor or nurse will want to take you off steroid pills as soon as possible. Even though these medicines help, they can also cause problems of their own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wet or damp dressings</strong> &ndash; These can be helpful for skin that is crusting or oozing. To use a wet or damp dressing, you will need to wear 2 layers of clothing. First, you put on a layer of damp cotton clothes over your rash. Then, you put on a layer of dry clothes on top of the damp ones. People who need these dressings often wear them at night when they sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478263907\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eczema-atopic-dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eczema (atopic dermatitis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pyoderma gangrenosum (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=contact-dermatitis-including-latex-dermatitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Contact dermatitis (including latex dermatitis) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=poison-ivy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Poison ivy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
