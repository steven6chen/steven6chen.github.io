The defining clinical feature of PHTS is the presence of hamartomatous tumors, which are disorganized growths of native cells in native tissues. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2181235516\"><span class=\"h2\">Phenotypic spectrum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotypic spectrum of PHTS includes the following entities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cowden syndrome (also known as Cowden disease or multiple hamartoma syndrome) is the best-described PHTS. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Besides multiple hamartomas in a variety of tissues, patients have characteristic dermatologic manifestations such as trichilemmomas, oral fibromas, and punctate palmoplantar keratoses, and an increased risk of breast, endometrial, thyroid, kidney and colorectal cancers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is another rare PHTS inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

High penetrance of cancer, as seen in Cowden syndrome, has not been clearly documented. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genotype analyses have concluded that a similar mutation spectrum in the <em>PTEN</em> gene is found in both Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes, leading to the conclusion that they are related allelic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Loss of function of this gene contributes to oncogenesis, and somatic mutations are frequently identified in various malignancies. As a result, the <em>PTEN</em> gene, which is located on chromosome 10q23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. </p><p>Germline mutations in <em>PTEN</em> are found in many patients with Cowden syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Although these reports describe patients that do not meet criteria for a PHTS diagnosis, they do not describe the clinical outcomes of these patients nor comment on the development of PHTS when these subjects reach adulthood. Autism and macrocephaly arise early in life and may be childhood manifestations of PHTS rather than a discrete phenotype. Long-term follow-up of these patients will be needed to determine their risk for development of other manifestations and especially malignancies. Until this is clarified, if a <em>PTEN</em> mutation is detected, it is reasonable to follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) screening recommendations for Cowden syndrome.

(See <a href=\"#H5356445\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Cowden syndrome have characteristic mucocutaneous lesions and an elevated risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial, colorectal, and renal cancers as well as various benign manifestations such as macrocephaly and dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum. (See <a href=\"#H462459910\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Updated clinical diagnostic criteria have been established for Cowden syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91666 \">table 1</a>), as well as proposed criteria for genetic testing for <em>PTEN</em> mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72070 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H462459982\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment of the benign and malignant manifestations of Cowden syndrome is performed as per usual practice for sporadic occurrence. (See <a href=\"#H232667011\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A major focus of management of individuals with Cowden syndrome is on cancer surveillance (see <a href=\"#H232666982\" class=\"local\">'Cancer surveillance'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend annual comprehensive physical exam, annual thyroid ultrasound, colonoscopy at least every five years starting at age 35, and annual renal ultrasound at age 40. In women, we recommend biannual or annual clinical breast exam at age 25 and annual mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at age 30.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition, endometrial cancer surveillance with blind biopsies beginning at age 30 to 35, or five years younger than the earliest familial endometrial cancer diagnosis, for premenopausal women and annual transvaginal ultrasound examination for postmenopausal women can be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The options of risk-reducing mastectomy and hysterectomy should be discussed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not recommend screening for brain tumors. However, given the increased incidence of dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum and the nonspecific and insidious symptoms, there should be a low index of suspicion in patients who meet criteria for Cowden syndrome, and a low threshold to perform neuroimaging in any patient with Cowden syndrome who develops a persistent headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is characterized by macrocephaly, penile lentigines, lipomas, vascular abnormalities, hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps, and developmental delay. They lack the documented high penetrance of cancer seen in Cowden syndrome, although several cases of thyroid cancer have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H462460023\" class=\"local\">'Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the effects in multiple organ systems, a multidisciplinary treatment team is needed, including dedicated genetic counseling. There are no consensus diagnostic criteria or management recommendations for Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. We recommend following the cancer surveillance protocol for Cowden syndrome in patients who have a documented <em>PTEN</em> mutation or a clinical diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H462460048\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other syndromes have been linked with <em>PTEN</em> mutations, including Proteus-like (segmental overgrowth, lipomatosis, arteriovenous malformation, and epidermal nevus [SOLAMEN]) syndrome and autism with macrocephaly. It is unclear if these conditions have a similarly elevated risk of malignancy, but if a <em>PTEN</em> mutation is found, it is reasonable to use the recommended cancer surveillance for Cowden syndrome.
