It is one of the most common treatable causes of intellectual disability (mental retardation). However, most newborn babies with this disorder have few or no clinical manifestations of thyroid hormone deficiency. In addition, the majority of cases are sporadic, so it is not possible to predict which infants are likely to be affected. For these reasons, newborn screening programs were developed to detect and treat this condition as early as possible, by measuring either thyroxine (T4) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) in heel stick blood specimens. These screening efforts were initiated in the mid-1970s and have been largely successful, although severely affected infants may still have a slightly reduced intelligence quotient&nbsp;(IQ) and other neurologic deficits despite prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Interpretation of screening tests requires an understanding of thyroid physiology in newborn babies.

With respect to thyroid function, thyroglobulin synthesis can be detected at four weeks, iodine trapping at 8 to 10 weeks, and thyroxine (T4) and, to a lesser extent, triiodothyronine (T3) synthesis and secretion at 12 weeks. Hypothalamic neurons contain thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) at six to eight weeks, the pituitary-portal vascular system begins to develop at 8 to 10 weeks, and thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) secretion can be detected at 12 weeks. Maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis occurs during the second half of gestation, but completely normal feedback relationships are not mature until one to two months of postnatal life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-synthesis-and-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone synthesis and physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pattern of changes during gestation is as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68673\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68673 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first trimester, T4 in the circulation is of maternal origin, as the fetal thyroid does not produce significant amounts of T4 until the second half of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thereafter, the rise in serum T4 concentrations is a result of both an increase in hepatic production of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and, to a lesser degree, an increase in fetal thyroidal T4 production stimulated by TSH secretion. Fetal serum T4 concentrations rise from a mean of approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (26 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> at 12 weeks to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (128 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The same is true for heel stick blood values, as collected for routine newborn screening for hypothyroidism two to five days after delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51672\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51672 \">table 1</a>). The cord serum T4 concentration averages 5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (70 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in infants less than 1000 gm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and 6.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (81 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in infants born at less than 30 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

However, these changes are quantitatively smaller, especially in the most premature infants, most likely because of immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The reference range for thyroid hormones thus varies by gestational age and also by postnatal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72215 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>As in term infants, serum T4 concentrations fall in the first week of life in low-birth-weight preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This fall is greater in very-low-birth-weight, more premature infants, in whom T4 clearance is more rapid. In infants from areas in which iodine deficiency is endemic, lack of adequate iodine intake contributes to the fall in serum T4 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>After the first week, serum T4 and T3 concentrations gradually rise in the most premature infants (those born at 23 to 27 weeks gestational age). By three to six weeks of life, the values in these infants (&lt;28 weeks of gestation) overlap the range of normal in term infants, although the mean values are slightly lower (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72215 \">table 2</a>). In less premature infants judged to be healthy (30 to 35 weeks of gestation), serum T4 rises and peaks at seven days, and then falls. In these infants, the thyroid hormone measurements overlap with the normal range for a term newborn after the first week of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2734026183\"><span class=\"h2\">Association between physiologic hypothyroxinemia and neurologic outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observational studies demonstrate a relationship between the low T4 concentrations in premature infants and intellectual disability or problems in neurodevelopment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>].

This is due to physiologic differences in thyroid function, including the lower T4 levels after birth and the later rise in TSH levels with maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, as well as fluctuations as they recover from nonthyroidal illness. After excluding these false-positive and false-negative results by serial testing, the actual prevalence of permanent congenital primary hypothyroidism in preterm infants is similar to that in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Because of the potential for false-negative and false-positive screening results in this population, we suggest that very preterm infants (eg, birth weight &lt;1500 g or gestational age &lt;32 weeks) undergo a routine repeat screening test (eg, at two to four weeks of age) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51189\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51189 \">algorithm 1</a>). This strategy applies regardless of the thyroid function test approach used by the screening program, and is recommended by many programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>False-positive results</strong> &ndash; Preterm infants often have a characteristic fluctuation in thyroid hormones during the first few weeks of life, consisting of transient mild hypothyroxinemia, followed by a compensatory mild and transient elevation in serum TSH levels. These abnormalities can be considered physiologic because they usually resolve spontaneously, but can cause false-positive results of initial newborn screening tests. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The transient hypothyroxinemia (low T4) may cause false-positive results in screening programs that use T4 as the primary screening test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Preterm infants (&lt;37 weeks gestation) account for about 12 percent of births, yet they account for a much higher percent of infants with blood T4 concentrations below a selected cutoff, (eg, &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile, equivalent to approximately 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [103 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The resultant TSH rise also may cause false-positive results, especially in infants with extremely low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The TSH elevation usually is mild (typically 6 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> and usually returns to normal within the first few weeks of life. Thus, this pattern can be considered a normal response to the physiologic hypothyroxinemia seen in some healthy preterm infants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some preterm infants have greater and more persistent deviations from normal values, typically seen as low screening blood T4 values and delayed elevation in screening TSH values (eg, TSH rising to &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [serum] or &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [whole blood] at 15 to 30 days of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In such cases, it may be difficult to distinguish between physiologic fluctuations in thyroid hormones due to prematurity and true primary hypothyroidism, which may be transient or permanent. While some infants with a TSH elevation as high as 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> may have normal results without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], they may still be at risk for adverse effects on brain development until they recover to normal thyroid function. We recommend treating these cases, even if this means treating some infants unnecessarily. A clinical strategy for making the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism and initiating treatment is outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H397784994\" class=\"local\">'Primary hypothyroidism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3762236060\" class=\"local\">'Transient versus permanent hypothyroidism'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>False-negative results</strong> &ndash; In addition, some preterm infants with congenital primary hypothyroidism are more likely to have a delayed rise in serum TSH, creating the potential for a false-negative result in screening programs that employ a primary TSH test. This form of hypothyroidism developing over time would be missed if screening is performed only once within the first few days of life. For example, infants with birth weight &lt;1500 g who are ultimately shown to have primary hypothyroidism have a rate of delayed TSH elevation between 1:95 to 1:294 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4202024881\"><span class=\"h3\">Effects of nonthyroidal illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid function testing also may be affected by medical complications associated with preterm birth, such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or intrauterine growth retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Preterm infants with RDS and other medical problems tend to not have the expected postnatal increases in serum TSH, T4, and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations; their serum T4 and T3 concentrations may decrease at 24 hours of age and be low until the infant recovers from their acute illness or gains weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Thereafter, the concentrations rise slowly in the survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A study of late preterm and term infants with RDS showed that serum free T4 remains low for the first five days of life; the decrease in free T4 levels correlates with severity of illness scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>These medical conditions tend to depress serum total T4 concentrations more often than serum free T4 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, at least some of the fall in serum total T4 concentrations is a result of decreases in serum protein binding of T4. In contrast, serum total and free T3 concentrations are low, because peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is decreased. In addition, some very sick infants have low serum TSH concentrations, which further lowers serum T4 and T3 concentrations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>). Furthermore, if sick preterm infants are treated with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] or dopamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], these drugs also may decrease TSH secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3530046106\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening protocol and interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborn screening for hypothyroidism is recommended for all preterm infants, as it is for full-term infants. Blood for screening is collected onto filter paper cards after heel prick, and the cards are then sent to a centralized laboratory for testing. The initial sample is usually collected between one and 48 hours after birth. The rationale for early timing of this collection is to obtain a specimen before administration of any blood products, which might alter test results for certain disorders that are included in the newborn screen, eg, screening for hemoglobinopathies. However, it is important that all preterm infants have at least one additional screening test for hypothyroidism because they have high rates of false-positive and false-negative results on the initial screening test due to their immaturity. The threshold birth weight or gestational age for which the additional screening test is performed varies among screening programs. (See <a href=\"#H339439627\" class=\"local\">'Implications of variation in thyroid function in preterm infants'</a> above.) </p><p>The timing and type of follow-up testing depends on the initial results, as outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51189\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51189 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2230727575\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial and follow up screening tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial screen is performed on a sample collected between one and 48 hours after birth.

In some programs, three screening tests are performed (zero to two days; three to five days; and two to four weeks of age). If the results of the screening test at two to four weeks of age are entirely normal, then no further screening is required. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal results</strong> &ndash; Preterm infants with elevated TSH on any of the screening tests (with low T4 or normal T4) should undergo measurement of <strong>serum </strong>free T4 and TSH.

Free thyroxine (T4) and T4 levels vary with gestational and postnatal age. The thyroid function data in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72215 \">table 2</a>) can be used as a guideline in interpreting serum thyroid function test results, based on gestational age and postnatal age of the specimen (where normal is defined as &plusmn; 2 standard deviations).

Some preterm infants may manifest low serum free T4 levels on both the standard analog and equilibrium dialysis method. In these cases, it may be impossible to separate these results, more likely attributable to prematurity and nonthyroidal illness syndrome, from the relatively rare case of central hypothyroidism. Evidence for other pituitary hormone deficiencies or congenital midline brain defects (see below) strengthens the possibility of true central hypothyroidism. Lacking any of these findings, our practice is to follow serum free T4 levels (by equilibrium dialysis) weekly for a few weeks; we recommend T4 treatment only in those cases where the free T4 fails to normalize. </p><p>Central hypothyroidism can be due to isolated TSH deficiency, but is more likely in infants with evidence for other pituitary hormone deficiencies, presence on imaging of pituitary abnormalities (eg, ectopic posterior pituitary gland) or midline defects (eg, absent septum pellucidum), or a history of central nervous system insult that may have caused hypothalamic-pituitary injury. Therefore, all cases with laboratory testing compatible with central hypothyroidism should be evaluated for other pituitary hormone deficiencies, if not already done.
