Typically, neoadjuvant treatment has taken the form of chemotherapy, although there is increasing interest in expanding the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in certain subsets of patients.</p><p>This topic will review patient selection, pretreatment assessment, chemotherapy options, and evaluation and treatment after neoadjuvant therapy. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.

Neoadjuvant therapy also permits an early evaluation of the effectiveness of systemic therapy. The surrogate endpoint, the presence or absence of residual invasive cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, is a strong prognostic factor for risk of recurrence, especially in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1908259278\" class=\"local\">'Poor response or progression on neoadjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Although it was hypothesized that overall survival would be improved through neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as it provides earlier initiation of systemic therapy in patients at higher risk of distant recurrence, randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent mortality for pre- or postoperative delivery of systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/1,3,6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,6-12</a>].</p><p>In addition to these clinical objectives, neoadjuvant therapy gives researchers the opportunity to obtain radiologic imaging, tumor specimens, and blood samples prior to, during, and in patients with sufficient residual disease at surgery, after the preoperative treatment. This enables research aimed at identifying tumor- or patient-specific biomarkers of response or resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1754002893\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discussion that follows uses both clinical and pathologic staging in management decisions. Particular notes regarding pathologic assessment are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control (AJCC-UICC) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) breast cancer staging system uses &quot;y&quot; to designate the pathologic stage after neoadjuvant therapy (ypTNM). The tumor (ypT) is measured as the largest single focus of invasive tumor, not including areas of fibrosis within the tumor bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most widely accepted definition of pathologic complete response (pCR) requires the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast and the absence of measurable disease in any sampled axillary nodes <span class=\"nowrap\">(ypT0/is</span> ypN0). The presence of residual in-situ carcinoma does not affect risk of distant recurrence, so long as there is no residual invasive cancer. This is the definition used in the following discussion, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11989615\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While originally developed for patients with locally advanced breast cancer, in whom even a mastectomy may not be an option, neoadjuvant therapy is now frequently administered to patients with operable breast cancers, in efforts to improve cosmetic outcomes following surgery or to limit the extent of axillary lymph node removal. Discussions between the surgeon and medical oncologist are therefore important in determining the benefits of neoadjuvant therapy for a given patient. Potential indications are listed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Locally advanced breast cancer</strong> &ndash; Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (anatomic stage IIB T3 disease to IIIC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>)), no matter the subtype, are ideal candidates for neoadjuvant therapy because their cancers are often not amenable to upfront resection, much less breast conservation, and because their risk of recurrence warrants systemic chemotherapy. Many patients with tumors larger than 5 cm, even if potentially operable, are considered to have locally advanced breast cancer and have been included in neoadjuvant therapy clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer#H528513711\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Locally advanced breast cancer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Select cases of early-stage breast cancer</strong> &ndash; Patients with early-stage breast cancer (stage I or II) are appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy if breast-conserving surgery is not possible due to a high tumor-to-breast ratio, or if the expected postoperative cosmetic outcome would be suboptimal due to tumor location. Additionally, patients with even smaller (T1c) triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers may be offered neoadjuvant therapy since these patients would receive chemotherapy at some point in their treatment course anyway, and these subtypes are associated with a high likelihood of response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-the-clinical-approach-to-er-pr-negative-her2-negative-triple-negative-breast-cancer#H97090639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors and the clinical approach to ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (Triple-negative) breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers is less clear. While chemotherapy in such cases infrequently yields a pathologic complete response (pCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>], neoadjuvant treatment will often promote tumor shrinkage that is sufficient to allow for breast conservation in a patient who otherwise would have undergone mastectomy. Whether such patients should be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy depends on many factors, including patient age and comorbidities and clinical stage. Tumor characteristics including grade and intensity of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression may help differentiate between patients more or less likely to respond to chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy. Further discussion of indications for neoadjuvant therapy for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-therapy-for-newly-diagnosed-hormone-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A potential indication for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer, regardless of the size of the primary tumor, is to downstage the axillary nodes in patients with limited node-positive disease (cN1). The standard surgical approach to patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer has been an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), which is associated with higher rates of lymphedema, restricted mobility of the affected arm, and other locoregional complications than encountered following sentinel node dissection. As it does in the breast, neoadjuvant chemotherapy often shrinks nodal disease in cN1 patients, and results of contemporary studies suggest that such patients can be effectively treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and regional nodal irradiation, with much lower rates of lymphedema and other complications. (See <a href=\"#H4074438079\" class=\"local\">'Positive axilla prior to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Multiple clinical trials have compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy in women with early breast cancer who are candidates for surgery. An individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group based upon data from 4756 women in 10 trials that were initiated between 1983 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an increased frequency of breast-conserving therapy (65 versus 49 percent). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of local recurrence (15-year local recurrence rate, 21.4 versus 15.9 percent; rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.61), which may be attributable to the increased use of breast-conserving surgery. There was no significant difference between neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy in the risk of distant recurrence (15-year rate, 38.2 versus 38.0 percent) or breast cancer mortality (34.4 versus 33.7 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with temporary contraindications for surgery </strong>&ndash; Neoadjuvant systemic therapy is a treatment option for patients who have medical contraindications to undergoing surgery at diagnosis but in whom surgery is anticipated at a later date, such as women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-treatment#H84662649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Systemic therapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11990037\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretreatment evaluation is aimed at confirming pathology and documenting the extent of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11994795\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all patients presenting with a new diagnosis of breast cancer, histopathologic confirmation and evaluation of receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) must be obtained before initiating treatment. Radiopaque clips should be placed in the tumor, either at the time of the diagnostic biopsy or at some other time prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. The clips allow for confirmation that the site of the tumor was removed as well as pathologic assessment of the surgical specimen, especially in cases in which neoadjuvant therapy significantly shrinks or eradicates the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;, section on 'Clip placement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3660172124\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging should be performed prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to document the extent of the disease. In most cases, ultrasound of the breast is sufficient to document tumor size. However, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful to evaluate disease extent, including assessing for the presence of multicentric disease, especially in patients with dense breast tissue on mammography, the presence of deep axillary and internal mammary lymph nodes, or invasion of the underlying chest wall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mri-of-the-breast-and-emerging-technologies#H10606323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MRI of the breast and emerging technologies&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients'</a>.)</p><p>While detection of overt metastatic disease would alter the patient&rsquo;s treatment plan and goals, the likelihood of detecting it with routine imaging studies is low, in the absence of suspicious symptoms or findings. To avoid the unnecessary expense of these tests and the complications of dealing with false-positive findings, we typically omit them in patients with clinical stage I or II disease but order them in patients with clinical stage III disease or inflammatory breast cancer, as well as in patients with symptoms or abnormal findings (including laboratory values) that might be due to otherwise occult metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11994803\"><span class=\"h2\">Node evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a physical exam on the axilla for all patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer. For those in whom lymph nodes are palpated, we perform ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB) to confirm pathologic involvement. This is done to rule out a false-positive clinical finding due to reactive lymph nodes or other benign histology, which could influence surgical management of the axilla after NACT. For those in whom no lymph nodes are palpated, we obtain an axillary ultrasound. If there is a suspicious lymph node on ultrasound (based on size or a thickened cortex), we perform FNA or CNB of the suspicious lymph node. While there are false-negative results with either FNA or CNB (20 to 25 percent for FNA, and slightly lower for CNB), a positive sample in a patient previously considered node negative will allow more appropriate treatment planning, especially as it relates to surgical management of the axilla after NACT. (See <a href=\"#H4074438079\" class=\"local\">'Positive axilla prior to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In a patient with a positive FNA or CNB, we favor placement of a radiopaque clip in the involved lymph node to identify it in case it is no longer prominent after NACT. There is evidence that removal of the clipped node at the time of post-NACT sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) lowers the false-negative rate (1.4 versus 10.1 percent with SLNB alone, in one prospective study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, locating the small clip can be challenging if a facility does not have radiograph equipment in the operating room. Alternatives being studied include radiolabeled seeds, magnetic clips, or nonvital dyes.</p><p>While some centers pursue pretreatment SLNB for those without evidence of lymph node involvement on exam or imaging, we typically defer this until after neoadjuvant treatment. This avoids an additional surgical procedure and preserves the prognostic information from the response in the sentinel nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although it is not our preferred approach, the management of patients with clinically negative axillary exams who receive a pretreatment SLNB is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H766732822\" class=\"local\">'Those with SLNB prior to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179173117\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H227892254\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy, given with anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted drugs if the tumor is HER2 positive, is the standard neoadjuvant approach. Neoadjuvant therapy in such patients, including selection of chemotherapeutic regimen and biologic therapy, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer#H487979734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients with hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy remains the standard neoadjuvant treatment option, although endocrine therapy may be used as neoadjuvant treatment among a certain subset of such patients. The choice between chemotherapy and endocrine neoadjuvant therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-therapy-for-newly-diagnosed-hormone-positive-breast-cancer#H1445425805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic options'</a>.)</p><p>The sections below describe chemotherapy options for patients with HER2-negative disease. Special considerations for those with triple-negative disease are discussed afterwards. (See <a href=\"#H1345511935\" class=\"local\">'Triple-negative disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H563919657\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is associated with high rates of clinical response and a greater likelihood of facilitating cosmetically acceptable surgery, including breast conservation in patients who were not considered candidates for such an approach prior to NACT. However, NACT has not been shown to improve disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) compared with adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The outcomes of NACT were demonstrated in a 2007 meta-analysis that included data from 5500 women participating in 1 of 14 trials reported between 1991 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Compared with adjuvant chemotherapy, NACT resulted in:<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in the risk of having a modified radical mastectomy performed (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.75).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Equivalent OS (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.09) and DFS (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.07).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of locoregional recurrence (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43). This is assumed to be a by-product of the higher breast conservation rates achieved with NACT and is of limited concern since it does not impact DFS or OS.</p><p/><p>Among patients treated with NACT, a documented pathologic complete response (pCR) at surgery was prognostically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25</a>]. Patients with a pCR had significant improvements in both OS (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69) and DFS (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37-0.63) compared with patients with residual invasive disease. These differences are more pronounced in patients with more proliferative breast cancer subtypes, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; event-free survival [EFS] HR 0.24 for pCR versus not) and HER2-positive breast cancer (EFS HR 0.39 for pCR versus not) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The prognostic significance of pCR in women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is less than in other biologic subtypes, likely due, at least in part, to the efficacy of adjuvant endocrine therapy in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790471397\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regimens utilized in the adjuvant setting also demonstrate activity as neoadjuvant treatment. Commonly used regimens for patients with HER2-negative disease include anthracycline-based regimens such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> followed or preceded by a taxane (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> [AC-T]) and nonanthracycline-containing regimens such as docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC), amongst others. Most women warranting neoadjuvant therapy have larger tumors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nodal involvement, and would qualify as &quot;higher-risk&quot; cases. As in the adjuvant setting, in higher-risk patients with HER2-negative cancers (TNBC or node-positive, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer), we favor an anthracycline-based regimen (eg, AC-T). For those in whom the potential cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines are a primary concern, nonanthracycline regimens are a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H638075278\" class=\"local\">'Nonanthracycline-based alternatives'</a> below.)</p><p>Commonly used regimens for patients with HER2-positive disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4132027245\"><span class=\"h4\">Anthracycline-based regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In HER2-negative patients, we typically administer four cycles of dose-dense (every two weeks) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> given either weekly for 12 weeks <span class=\"nowrap\">(AC/weekly</span> T) or every two weeks for four cycles <span class=\"nowrap\">(AC/T)<u></span>.</u></p><p>The Oxford meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy trials demonstrated benefit for anthracycline-based regimens over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (CMF)-based regimens, and the benefit for adding taxanes to anthracyclines further improved outcomes in the adjuvant setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;</a>). As one key goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to provide effective &quot;adjuvant&quot; treatment, most women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy should receive anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further rationale for the use of anthracyclines and taxanes in the preoperative setting comes directly from clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment. Specifically in the neoadjuvant setting, multiple studies have demonstrated that addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen, either concurrently or sequentially, is associated with increased response rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/12,27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27-33</a>]. As an example, in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B27 trial, 2411 patients received four cycles of neoadjuvant AC after which they were randomly assigned to receive no further chemotherapy, to be treated with four cycles of neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> every three weeks, or to undergo surgery followed by four cycles of adjuvant docetaxel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

If imaging is pursued, ultrasound (US) of the involved breast and, if clinically positive prior to NACT, the ipsilateral axilla, is usually sufficient. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be obtained if the tumor was not well visualized on US or if better definition of the extent of disease will assist the surgeon in determining the optimal surgical approach. Additionally patients considering breast-conserving therapy (BCT), in whom pretreatment MRI findings have been clinically important, may benefit from repeat MRI.

The major findings were that patients with suspicious nodes on post-NACT US were very likely to have positive nodes at surgery (72 percent) and to have a greater number of positive nodes and larger nodal metastases than patients with normal-appearing nodes. Limiting SLNB to patients with a normal US and pursuing ALND in patients with abnormal US reduced the FNR of SLNB (when at least two sentinel nodes are sampled) from 13 to 10 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with abnormal posttreatment axillary US, ALND should be pursued, which may be done at the time of breast surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with negative or uncertain axillary US results, posttreatment SLNB as well as removal of any clipped or other marked nodes should be obtained.

In patients with a negative SLNB post-NACT (ypN0), an ALND can usually be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], particularly if at least two sentinel nodes are sampled, and the patient will be treated with adjuvant axillary radiation therapy (RT). For those patients who only had one sentinel lymph node identified, the optimal management is unclear because of the higher likelihood of a false-negative SLNB in such settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. As an example, in the SENTINA study, the FNR when one, two, or three sentinel lymph nodes were evaluated were 24, 18, and 5 percent, respectively.

In neither CALGB 40603 nor GeparSixto did carboplatin improve the frequency of lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, though a nonsignificant trend existed in which patients on CALGB 40603 who were not candidates for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) were more likely to be judged eligible for this approach after treatment if they had received carboplatin (57 versus 44 percent).

Typically, neoadjuvant treatment has taken the form of chemotherapy, although there is increasing interest in expanding the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in certain subsets of patients. (See <a href=\"#H541772675\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While all systemic therapy given for nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer is intended to reduce the risk of distant recurrence, the purpose of administering it neoadjuvantly is to downstage the tumor, allowing for less extensive surgery, improved cosmetic outcomes, and reduced postoperative complications such as lymphedema. (See <a href=\"#H4049625435\" class=\"local\">'Goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) include those with locally advanced breast cancer and those with temporary contraindications to surgery (such as pregnancy). Select patients with earlier-stage cancer may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy if breast-conserving surgery is not possible due to a high tumor-to-breast ratio, or if the expected postoperative cosmetic outcome would be suboptimal due to tumor location.

For those in whom the potential cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines are a primary concern, nonanthracycline regimens are a reasonable alternative. Some patients with hormone-positive disease may benefit from neoadjuvant endocrine therapy rather than chemotherapy.
