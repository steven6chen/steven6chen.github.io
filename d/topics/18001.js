Women can have vulvar pain from a specific etiology, pain without an identifiable cause, or both. Treatment must therefore address a wide range of potential etiologies as well as provide an approach for women whose pain is not understood by available paradigms.</p><p>This topic will review our approach to treatment of vulvodynia. The evaluation of women with vulvar pain, approach to the woman with sexual pain, and evaluation and treatment of vulvar pain from specific etiologies are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the woman with sexual pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-localized-vulvar-pain-syndrome-formerly-vulvodynia-vestibulodynia-vulvar-vestibulitis-or-focal-vulvitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of localized vulvar pain syndrome (formerly vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, or focal vulvitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H831263327\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the Fourth International Consensus of Sexual Medicine (ICSM) in 2015, experts representing several international societies dedicated to the study of vulvar pain established revised nomenclature for vulvar pain conditions, based upon available research and clinical expertise. These new terminologies acknowledged vulvar pain and vulvodynia as complex, multifactorial pain syndromes with varied etiologies and implied that treatment should be tailored to each individual based upon their clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111440\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111440 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Based on the revised nomenclature, we use the following terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvar pain describes symptoms related to a specific disorder (eg, inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvodynia refers to idiopathic, chronic vulvar pain of at least three months' duration.

Research suggests that successful treatment programs are multimodal and involve the interdisciplinary team of a medical clinician, a physical therapist, and a psychobehavioral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sex therapist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3104751822\"><span class=\"h1\">BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We review behaviors that can be helpful, or may be harmful, with our patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvar hygiene &ndash; Good vulvar hygiene is the first and easiest step women can take to alleviate irritation and discomfort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111441 \">table 2</a>). We ask women to avoid applying soap, fragrance, or other products to the affected area as any product can cause a topical dermatitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While the supporting data are sparse, we advise women follow the additional lifestyle changes proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and by the authors of the Vulvodynia Guideline, who note that gentle care of the vulva can contribute significantly to pain reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Specific strategies that they advise include wearing non-constrictive cotton underwear during the day and none during hours of sleep; avoiding pantyhose, tights, and tight pants; using mild soap for bathing and water only for cleansing the vulva; avoiding douches, commercial vaginal wipes, deodorants, bubble bath, deodorants, tampons, or pads; using water-based non-scented, non-warming, non-allergic lubricants for intercourse; applying cool gel packs to the vulva before <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after sex to reduce pain and swelling; and avoiding activities that place pressure directly on the vulva such as bicycling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom relief &ndash; Soaking in warm baths with either Epsom salt or colloidal oatmeal can be soothing. Application of ice packs to the vulva for 10 to 15 minutes at a time every four to six hours can reduce burning sensations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress reduction &ndash; We encourage stress reduction and relaxation techniques because data suggest women with vulvodynia have higher levels of stress and anxiety than healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. As stress may exacerbate symptoms of vulvodynia and vulvodynia symptoms tend to worsen stress, stress reduction may break this cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-physical-cognitive-and-spiritual-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complementary and alternative treatments for anxiety symptoms and disorders: Physical, cognitive, and spiritual interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lubrication &ndash; Over-the-counter personal lubricants can be both helpful and harmful to women with vulvodynia and female sexual pain. Topical lubricants that moisturize the skin or reduce friction during sexual contact are typically helpful. Products that contain alcohol (ie, gels) or warming agents can worsen symptoms. Anecdotally, products such as coconut, olive, avocado, soybean, or vitamin E oil appear to reduce symptoms, but supporting data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; While exercise can be helpful to reduce stress and anxiety, we advise avoiding activities that can directly irritate the vulva, such as spinning class or bicycling, at least while the patient is symptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2366240388\"><span class=\"h1\">PELVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603226494\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In accordance with multiple medical associations, we advise pelvic floor physical therapy as a primary treatment for vulvodynia because of the numerous studies demonstrating treatment efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/2,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12-14</a>]. Women with vulvodynia and sexual pain commonly exhibit myofascial trigger points and increased muscle tension in the pelvis, abdominal, back, and pelvic floor muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/4,12,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,15-20</a>]. The hypertonicity results from increased tissue inflammation, altered perfusion, and abnormal neural patterns, all of which contribute to muscle restriction and decreased mobility in these areas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of vulvodynia and sexual pain associated with pelvic muscle dysfunction can be exceedingly complex because the pelvic floor muscles surround the urethral opening, the anorectal opening, and the vaginal opening. The resultant widespread muscle tension can contribute to a self-perpetuating pain cycle and produce symptoms such as stabbing, shooting, or referred pain; vulvovaginal sensitivity; burning with penetration; pain with intravaginal thrusting; pain with orgasm; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postcoital pain. Pelvic floor physical therapy works to restore proper muscle length, decrease muscle tension, and decrease pain, which ultimately decreases dyspareunia and restores function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Pelvic floor physical therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2096593706\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic floor physical therapy involves a variety of modalities, including pelvic and core mobilization and stabilization; connective tissue, visceral, and neural mobilization; internal and external myofascial trigger point release, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. After a comprehensive assessment, the pelvic floor physical therapist begins treatment with manual connective tissue manipulation to decrease restrictions in pelvic muscles and nerves and improve circulation to ischemic areas and those with pelvic congestion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H3966595355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Pelvic floor physical therapy'</a>.)</p><p>A crucial aspect of pelvic floor and sexual rehabilitation is therapist-assisted stretching of the muscles of the hips, back, gluteus, and abdomen. The therapist then augments stretching exercises with strengthening techniques that address muscle weakness, with the goal of restoring balance and stability. Education regarding the progression and rate of strengthening is very important because restricted neural and connective tissue can become more irritated if these techniques are initiated prematurely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition to external tissue release and core stabilization, direct internal <span class=\"nowrap\">transvaginal/transrectal</span> release of muscles is a central aspect of pelvic floor physical therapy and sexual rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/17,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23,24</a>]. Internal manual therapy techniques reduce tissue adherence and restore skeletal alignment. These interventions allow women to sit more comfortably, participate in <span class=\"nowrap\">work/home</span> activities, and enjoy improved bladder, bowel, and sexual function. During internal treatment, therapists educate patients through proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, verbal cueing, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation techniques which coordinate mind-body control of the pelvic floor and down-train overactive muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/15,16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3487722402\"><span class=\"h2\">Home program</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As part of pelvic floor rehabilitation, the therapist develops a &quot;home program&quot; which may include abdominal, hip, pelvic, lower extremity, and back stretching; daily relaxation and breathing exercises; patient-performed manual techniques on external and internal tissue; and bladder and bowel re-training, as indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Vaginal dilators may be recommended to normalize the tone of the muscles, desensitize previously hypersensitive areas of the <span class=\"nowrap\">vulva/vagina,</span> and restore sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/22-24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24,27</a>]. When needed, techniques such as guided imagery and mindfulness meditation can be incorporated into the patient's home program to facilitate neural down-regulation. Learning relaxation, self-release, and gentle strengthening techniques can empower patients and instill confidence so that sexual rehabilitation can continue at home after discharge from therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2214464461\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological interventions focus on reducing pain, restoring sexual function and strengthening the couple relationship by targeting the thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and couple interactions associated with sexual pain. Interventions can be done in an individual, couple-based, or group format.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3661712438\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most commonly used and studied psychological interventions for pain, including vulvar and sexual pain. We prescribe individual and group CBT for our vulvodynia patients because this approach is a validated and noninvasive therapeutic option for sexual pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H2234320\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Behavioral medicine approaches'</a>.)</p><p>In CBT for vulvodynia, the woman <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partner are given psycho-education on the multidimensional impact of pain on the individual and the relationship. Concepts including the role of psychological and relationship factors in coping with pain and in the maintenance of pain are explored. Women are instructed to use a daily pain diary to raise awareness about factors that positively or negatively influence pain and to track progress toward recovery. With the help of the therapist, patients are then able to identify personal maladaptive coping strategies that increase pain and sexual dysfunction, such as catastrophizing, hypervigilance to pain, and excessive anxiety. Partner behaviors that maintain or intensify distress (such as responses to intimacy that range from low-involvement to overly solicitous or hostile) are also be identified. Throughout the course of therapy, the therapist continuously focuses on skill consolidation and maintenance of gains. Issues such as childhood trauma and significant relationship conflict are also addressed if considered integral to the onset or maintenance of sexual pain.</p><p>Trials assessing the impact CBT on vulvodynia are challenging in terms of selecting a control group. Despite this difficulty, trials that have compared CBT for the treatment of vulvodynia with vulvar vestibulectomy, biofeedback, corticosteroid cream, physical therapy, and supportive psychotherapy have reported symptom improvement with CBT that was at least equal, and often superior, to the other treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. In addition, CBT benefits were maintained at intervals ranging from 6 months to 2.5 years post-treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2257700207\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex therapy and couple-based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex therapy or couple-based therapy, which are types of CBT, can address the impact of the pain on sexual function. Some of the focuses of sex or couple-based therapy are techniques to enable women and their partners to make better use of approach behaviors, optimize their emotion regulation, learn better communication and self-assertiveness, and find ways to reconnect with each other through nonsexual physical and emotional intimacy, expanding their sexual repertoire to steer the focus away from intercourse, and sharing mutual experiences of desire, arousal, and sexual intimacy. In a prospective study of eight couples (in which the woman was diagnosed with provoked vulvodynia) participating in a 12-session couple therapy intervention, participants reported significant improvements in sexuality outcomes, pain-related cognitions, anxiety and depression for both members of the couple, and high treatment satisfaction, in addition to reduction of the woman's pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Of note, these treatment options are not specifically approved for the treatment of vulvodynia and therefore represent off-label use. In addition, the optimal treatment, dose, or route of administration are not known. As comparative data are sparse, the grouping below reflects our clinical experience, balance of risks and benefits, product availability, and cost.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2086104385\"><span class=\"h2\">Commonly used</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically use medication therapy in conjunction with behavior modification and psychological interventions. There are numerous topical medications available and used in clinical practice, but few controlled trials have been done to verify their efficacy or determine superiority. Many patients prefer topical preparations due to their low incidence of systemic side effects, ease of use, and ready availability. As with application of any topical agent to the vulva and vestibule, care must be taken to avoid irritating components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2458284360\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical lidocaine ointment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is typically used only for short-term symptom control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Episodic use of lidocaine 2% or 5% ointment can mitigate the pain and discomfort associated vulvodynia, particularly prior to bothersome activities or intercourse. We prescribe 5 percent lidocaine ointment to be applied to only the affected area as needed for symptom control after sex-play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The advantages of lidocaine ointment include that it can be used only when needed, is applied only to the affected tissue, is low cost, and has low risk of harm. Studies of topical lidocaine in treating vulvar pain suggest efficacy ranging from not better than placebo to 50 percent reduction of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/2,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556905620\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical estrogen cream</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the data are inconsistent, we find topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> 0.01% cream or compounded estradiol 0.01% plus testosterone 0.05% to 0.1% cream, applied at bedtime to the vulvar vestibule, reduces symptoms in some women with vulvodynia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual pain. For women with signs or symptoms of intravaginal atrophy or women who experience deep dyspareunia related to dryness, we advise biweekly nighttime dosing of 0.5 g estradiol to the vagina (not just the vestibule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other dosing regimens are available. Our practice is consistent with the National Vulvodynia Association and expert opinion that supports treatment of women with atrophic changes in the vulva and vestibule with topical estrogen or topical estrogen and testosterone cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>The role of hormones, particularly estrogen, with vulvodynia remains an enigma as data regarding association and treatment effect are conflicting. For menopausal women, studies have reported both that menopause status, estrogen levels, and vaginal atrophy are not correlated with symptom severity, as well as reported that symptoms worsen with menopause and falling estrogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

Three antiepileptic drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

As a placebo-controlled trial of anticonvulsant therapy for vulvodynia is underway, the authors of the International Consensus of Sexual Medicine (ICSM) panel advise waiting for the results of this pending trial rather than prescribing anticonvulsant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/2,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,58</a>].

After approximately 3 to 4 days, we then increase the dose to 100 mg orally three times a day. For women who tolerate the daytime dosing, we then increase the dose, every 7 to 14 days, to three divided doses of 300 mg or more per dose. Some patients require doses of 1200 mg orally three times a day (maximum dose is 1200 mg orally given three times per day). For women who note drowsiness with daytime doses, we titrate the single bedtime dose up to 300 mg, rather than the three times a day dosing regimen. As with tricyclic antidepressants, we educate patients that once they reach a therapeutic dose, they should be prepared to remain there for at least four to six weeks before assessing efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2888062290\"><span class=\"h3\">Capsaicin cream</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As prospective trial data are not available, the expert panel of the 2015 ICSM advised the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> only if other treatments had failed or as an alternative to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rationale for treatment with capsaicin is that women with vulvodynia have been found to have increased vanilloid receptors (VR1) in the peripheral terminals of nociceptor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Topical capsaicin has an agonist effect on VR1 (TRPV1), thereby producing desensitization to burning and decreased pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Two observational studies of topical capsaicin cream for the treatment of vulvodynia reported symptom improvement with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. However, both studies premedicated women with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> prior to the application of capsaicin, which makes it impossible to determine if improvement was due to either cream or a combination of both.</p><p>Of note, over-the-counter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> has alcohol in the base and is highly irritating to women with vulvodynia. When prescribed, we use compounded topical capsaicin cream that contains 0.025% to 0.05% cream in a hypoallergenic base. It is applied for 20 minutes per day to the vestibule and then removed. The initial regimen is performed daily for 12 weeks and then only as needed for symptom control. In our practice, compliance with this regimen improves when women pretreat the vestibule with 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> ointment for 10 minutes, then remove the lidocaine and apply topical capsaicin for 20 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2869085151\"><span class=\"h2\">Third tier</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3862526540\"><span class=\"h3\">Botulinum neurotoxin-A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we limit the use of botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A, commercial name Botox) to the third tier of treatment because of its high cost and temporary effect. Benefits typically last from 3 to 12 months. BoNT-A is used for the treatment of multiple chronic pain disorders because it blocks the release of glutamate and substance-P from nociceptive neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Although one randomly assigned trial, two case series, and two case reports have reported conflicting data on BoNT-A efficacy for vulvodynia, differing study designs and sites of injection limit comparison of outcomes or definitive conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>]. As the non-controlled studies reported significant efficacy, the expert panel of the 2015 ICSM concluded that BoNT-A is a reasonable treatment for vulvodynia, noting that the effect is far greater if the BoNT-A is injected into hypertonic pelvic floor muscles rather than into the vestibular ostium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In a retrospective review of 51 women with vulvodynia (19 with generalized and 32 with localized) treated with 2%, 4%, and 6% topical gabapentin, 80 percent of the patients improved by at least 50 percent, and 29 percent of the patients achieved full improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Vulvodynia can be localized or generalized; provoked, spontaneous, or mixed; primary or secondary in timing of onset; and of varying temporal patterns (eg, intermittent, persistent, constant, immediate, or delayed). (See <a href=\"#H831263327\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment of women with chronic vulvar pain includes a detailed history that includes discussion of pain symptoms, sexual practices, gynecologic and medical issues, and a comprehensive physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H3076760947\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As vulvodynia is a chronic condition, in which symptoms are managed but may be ongoing and characterized by periods of remission and flare, one goal of treatment is to set realistic expectations. We help women understand that improvement can be a slow process and, because there is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; treatment, that finding the correct therapy for them can take some trial and error, time, and patience. (See <a href=\"#H1456133391\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We review behaviors that can be helpful, or may be harmful, with our patients. We educate women on vulvar hygiene, stress relief, symptom reduction, lubrication, and exercise. (See <a href=\"#H3104751822\" class=\"local\">'Behavior modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In accordance with multiple medical associations, we advise pelvic floor physical therapy as a primary treatment for vulvodynia because of the numerous studies demonstrating treatment efficacy. Women with vulvodynia and sexual pain commonly exhibit myofascial trigger points and increased muscle tension in the pelvis, abdominal, back, and pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor physical therapy involves a variety of modalities, including pelvic and core mobilization and stabilization; connective tissue, visceral, and neural mobilization; internal and external myofascial trigger point release, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation (See <a href=\"#H2366240388\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic floor physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological interventions focus on reducing pain, restoring sexual function and strengthening the couple relationship by targeting the thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and couple interactions associated with sexual pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most commonly used and studied psychological interventions for pain, including vulvar and sexual pain. We prescribe individual and group CBT for our vulvodynia patients because this approach is a validated and noninvasive therapeutic option for sexual pain. (See <a href=\"#H2214464461\" class=\"local\">'Psychological intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-surgical medical therapy for the treatment of vulvodynia includes the use of topical preparations, oral medications, and injection therapy. Of note, these treatment options are not specifically approved for the treatment of vulvodynia and therefore represent off-label use. In addition, the optimal treatment, dose, or route of administration are not known. As comparative data are sparse, the grouping below reflects our clinical experience, balance of risks and benefits, product availability, and cost. (See <a href=\"#H690797156\" class=\"local\">'Medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complementary and alternative treatments appear to have a net positive benefit for chronic pain syndromes, although individual study data are conflicting. Specific modalities that have been reported to reduce vulvodynia symptoms include acupuncture, hypnosis, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. (See <a href=\"#H551820473\" class=\"local\">'Complementary and alternative treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is generally considered a treatment of last resort, particularly for women with localized, provoked vulvodynia (PVD, formerly vulvar vestibulitis), and performed on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H1919050809\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H554426447\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Elizabeth Gunther Stewart, MD, and Roya Rezaee, MD, FACOG, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-vulvodynia-vulvar-pain-of-unknown-cause/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bornstein J, Goldstein AT, Stockdale CK, et al. 2015 ISSVD, ISSWSH and IPPS Consensus Terminology and Classification of Persistent Vulvar Pain and Vulvodynia.
