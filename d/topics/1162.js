This decline is gradual and of a modest degree, but because many of the changes of aging are similar to those of hypogonadism due to known disease, the decline in testosterone has been postulated to be a cause of these changes of aging. Recent studies show that raising the testosterone levels of older men with low testosterone has some benefits, but no study yet has enrolled enough men and treated and observed them for long enough to determine the risk of this treatment.</p><p>The decline in testicular function with aging, its possible consequences, and the results of increasing testosterone levels in older men are reviewed here. Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism due to known disease is discussed separately.

In one, the European Male Aging Study (EMAS), of 3220 men ages 40 to 79 years, the serum total testosterone concentration fell 0.4 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a second study, a gradual decline in testosterone concentration was seen after age 35 years, with a more marked decline after age 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A study using serum samples from four population-based studies (EMAS, Framingham Heart Study, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men [MrOS], Male Sibling Study of Osteoporosis) of men from ages 19 to 79 that were assayed and standardized against gold-standard measurements performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), age-specific harmonized reference ranges were generated.

In 890 men participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, serum testosterone decreased at a fairly constant rate, independent of other clinical variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The parallels include a decline in libido and sexual activity, decreased muscle mass and strength, depressed mood, decreased bone mineral density (BMD), and anemia.

The combination of low serum testosterone (&lt;317 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [11 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> and three sexual symptoms, which occurred in 2.1 percent of men, was significantly associated with lower hemoglobin, estimated heel BMD, mid-upper arm circumference, and physical performance.

In contrast, there is general agreement that older men who have unequivocally low testosterone due to known hypothalamic-pituitary or testicular disease should be treated with testosterone as younger men. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) directed manufacturers of testosterone products to state in their labels that these products are approved only for men with low testosterone due to known causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>However, other expert groups argue that there may be a role for testosterone therapy in selected patients.

A committee of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) reviewed these and other trials and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that testosterone treatment of older men has any well-established benefit. The committee recommended that a coordinated set of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials should be performed to determine if testosterone does have any benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

They could also participate in any of the other trials for which they qualified.</p><p>Over 51,000 men were screened to enroll the 790 men who met inclusion criteria (only 1.5 percent of those screened).

The effect on sexual activity and sexual desire was likely of clinical significance because the effect sizes were 0.45 and 0.44, respectively, and participants who were treated with testosterone were significantly more likely than those treated with placebo to respond on a Patient Global Assessment of Change question that their sexual desire was better during treatment than before. The magnitude of rise in serum testosterone and estradiol concentrations was associated with the magnitude of improvement in sexual desire and sexual activity, but not erectile function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference between the testosterone- versus placebo-treated groups in walking distance on a six-minute walk test in the 390 men who were enrolled in the <strong>physical function</strong> trial, but testosterone did improve walking distance when all 788 men were included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitality</strong> (as assessed by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale in the vitality trial) did not differ in testosterone- versus placebo-treated men enrolled in the vitality trial (but testosterone improved vitality [energy] slightly when subjects from all three main trials were included) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

After 6 and 12 months, there were no differences in changes from baseline in testosterone- and placebo-treated men in test scores for memory and other cognitive functions (delayed paragraph recall, visual memory, executive function, or spatial ability), but testosterone improved executive function when all subjects from all three main trials were included.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coronary artery plaque</strong> &ndash; In a substudy of 170 men, one year of testosterone therapy was associated with a greater increase than placebo in noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume, as measured by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There was also a significantly greater increase in total plaque volume in the testosterone group but no change in the coronary calcification score in either group. Of note, 50 percent of the study subjects had severe atherosclerosis at baseline on CCTA. Major limitations of the study were the use of CCTA (a surrogate outcome for atherosclerosis) and the small size and short duration of the trial.

Testosterone treatment, however, did not improve vitality or cognitive function and was associated with an increase in noncalcified coronary artery plaque volume. Although testosterone treatment was not associated with increased risks of clinical cardiac events or prostate cancer, a much larger and longer trial would be needed to assess these risks with greater certainty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4229620358\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential harmful effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are theoretical and other reasons to think that testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone might exacerbate certain diseases. For example, the prostate gland is testosterone dependent, so it is reasonable to wonder if raising the serum testosterone concentration will increase the risk of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Erythropoiesis is also testosterone dependent, so raising the testosterone level, especially to supraphysiologic levels, can cause erythrocytosis.
