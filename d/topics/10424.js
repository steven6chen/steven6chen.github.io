For the minority of lactotroph adenomas that do not respond to dopamine agonists, other treatments must be used. Hyperprolactinemia due to nonadenoma causes should also be treated if it causes hypogonadism.</p><p>This topic will review the major issues concerning the therapy of hyperprolactinemia due to lactotroph adenomas and other causes, with the exception of treatment during pregnancy, which is discussed separately. The causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of lactotroph adenoma (prolactinoma) during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445458738\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two principal reasons why patients with hyperprolactinemia may need to be treated: existing or impending neurologic symptoms due to the large size of a lactotroph adenoma, and hypogonadism or other symptoms due to hyperprolactinemia, such as galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>A third indication is in women with mild hyperprolactinemia and normal cycles who are trying to conceive as they may have subtle luteal phase dysfunction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Menstrual cycle dysfunction'</a>). Our approach to management is similar to that suggested by the Endocrine Society Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445458796\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenoma size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lactotroph adenoma (prolactinoma) 1 cm or more in size is a macroadenoma. Treatment is usually essential when the tumor is large enough to cause neurologic symptoms, such as visual impairment or headache (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). Treatment is usually desirable when the adenoma extends outside of the sella and abuts or elevates the optic chiasm, or invades the cavernous or sphenoid sinuses or the clivus; lesions of this size are likely to continue to grow and eventually cause neurologic symptoms. </p><p>Microadenomas are less than 1 cm in diameter. Studies of the natural history of microadenomas show that 95 percent do not enlarge during four to six years of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The 5 percent that do enlarge should be treated because of the increase in size alone. (See <a href=\"#H361071866\" class=\"local\">'Withdrawal of dopamine agonists'</a> below.)</p><p>Prolactin secretion by lactotroph adenomas is usually proportional to their size. Adenomas &lt;1 cm in diameter are typically associated with serum prolactin values below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (8.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> those approximately 1.0 to 2.0 cm in diameter with values between 200 and 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (8.7 to 43.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> and those greater than 2.0 cm in diameter with values above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (43.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and as high as 50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (2173.91 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72540 \">figure 1</a>). There are exceptions to this generalization, however, as occasional patients have a large lactotroph adenoma but only modest hyperprolactinemia. Such adenomas are generally less well differentiated and respond less well to dopamine agonists than the more typical tumors.</p><p>In contrast to the extremely high serum prolactin concentrations that may be seen with lactotroph adenomas (in particular, macroadenomas), prolactin levels due to nonadenoma causes rarely exceed 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (8.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia#H125670444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Serum prolactin concentrations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445458845\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hyperprolactinemia is indicated when it causes hypogonadism by suppressing gonadotropin secretion or when it causes bothersome galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In premenopausal women, serum prolactin concentrations &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (4.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> are likely to be associated with amenorrhea and low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> levels (which lead to eventual bone loss and osteoporosis if untreated). The symptoms correlate with the magnitude of the hyperprolactinemia. Moderate degrees of hyperprolactinemia (eg, serum prolactin values of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [2.17 to 4.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> cause either amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, while women with milder degrees of hyperprolactinemia (20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [0.87 to 2.17 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> may have normal menstrual cycles or oligomenorrhea but infertility due to insufficient luteal phase <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperprolactinemia in premenopausal women can also cause galactorrhea. The presence of galactorrhea alone does not require treatment unless the patient finds it bothersome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women have markedly low <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> levels, and galactorrhea is rare. Hyperprolactinemia in these women is clinically recognized only in the unusual situation when a lactotroph adenoma becomes so large as to cause headaches or impair vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, hypogonadism can cause decreased libido and energy and eventually loss of sexual hair, loss of muscle mass, and osteoporosis. Hyperprolactinemia in men may also be associated with erectile dysfunction, even when the serum testosterone concentration is normal. The mechanism is unknown, but the erectile dysfunction usually improves dramatically when the hyperprolactinemia is corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Gynecomastia and galactorrhea may occur, but both are rare.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361074044\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF DOPAMINE AGONISTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dopamine agonist drug should usually be the first treatment for patients with hyperprolactinemia of any cause, including lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas) of all sizes, because these drugs decrease serum prolactin concentrations and decrease the size of most lactotroph adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Other approaches must be considered for the minority of patients whose adenomas are resistant to dopamine agonists or who cannot tolerate these drugs, and for those who are taking a medication (such as an antipsychotic drug) that cannot be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H361071682\" class=\"local\">'Intolerant or inadequate response'</a> below and <a href=\"#H88725190\" class=\"local\">'Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients with hyperprolactinemia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> is our first choice of drug, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> is our second choice. Pergolide had been used for Parkinson disease and hyperprolactinemia, but it was withdrawn from the market in the United States because of concerns about valvular heart disease. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinagolide-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quinagolide</a> is available in some countries, but not the United States.

It is an ergot dopamine agonist that is administered once or twice a week and has much less tendency to cause nausea than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. It may also be effective in patients resistant to bromocriptine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At the high doses used for the treatment of Parkinson disease, cabergoline is associated with an increased risk of valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], but at the lower doses generally used for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, cabergoline does not appear to be associated with this risk.

A review of 13 studies, as an example, showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> reduced the serum prolactin concentration to normal in 229 of 280 women (82 percent) with hyperprolactinemia, and in 12 studies, in 66 of 92 patients (71 percent) with lactotroph macroadenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cabergoline</a> may be superior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> in decreasing the serum prolactin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. This was illustrated in a trial of 459 women with hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea who had microadenomas or no obvious cause; the patients who were randomized to cabergoline were more likely to have a reduction of serum prolactin to normal (83 versus 52 percent in the bromocriptine group) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72539 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Macroprolactin is an umbrella term used to describe aggregates of prolactin and antibodies, some antiprolactin autoantibodies, to prolactin, that range in size from approximately 150 to 170 kD (the most common form of native prolactin in serum is 23 kD in size). Macroprolactinemia is sometimes misdiagnosed and treated as ordinary hyperprolactinemia. Misdiagnosis can be avoided by asking the laboratory to pretreat the serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate the macroprolactin before the immunoassay for prolactin.
