While some shift workers show circadian adjustment to their work schedule, many others do not. Those who do not adjust commonly experience excessive sleepiness during work and significant sleep disturbance.</p><p>It is estimated that one-third or more of shift workers experience impairments of sufficient severity to meet criteria for shift work disorder.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of sleep-wake disturbances associated with shift work and shift work disorder will be discussed here. Other circadian rhythm disorders, such as jet lag and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jet-lag\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jet lag&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-sleep-wake-phase-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900860\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disturbances to sleep and impaired alertness in shift workers can be explained by disruptions to two biological processes, referred to as Process S and Process C (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103729 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Process S &ndash; The drive for sleep is dependent on time since the last sleep episode. As such, sleep drive builds throughout wakefulness and dissipates with sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Process C &ndash; The second process is a rhythmic variation of sleep propensity that occurs independently of sleep. This process is governed by the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus. It is calibrated and synchronized by a series of environmental cues, most important of which is natural sunlight or bright artificial light.</p><p/><p>Under usual circumstances (ie, day workers), individuals go to bed when their sleep drive is high and their circadian signal for alertness is low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103729 \">figure 1</a>). However, individuals working nontraditional shifts may experience misalignment between their endogenous circadian rhythms and their scheduled work times. </p><p>As an example, night shift workers often attempt sleep during the day, when their endogenous circadian rhythms are promoting alertness. This results in fragmented and curtailed sleep, leading to insufficient dissipation of sleep drive. Night shift workers are also likely to be working when their circadian alerting signal is at its lowest level and melatonin secretion is rising, which is further compounded by poor quality sleep, resulting in difficulties maintaining alertness during night work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900884\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SPECTRUM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900891\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both sleep duration and sleep quality are commonly affected in shift workers. Shift workers generally report 30 to 60 minutes less sleep compared with day workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>], and individuals with shift work disorder (SWD) report even greater reductions in sleep, with an average decrease of approximately 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sleep restriction may be compounded by family and social obligations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The degree of sleep disruption may vary by type of shift work and whether the schedule is rotating or fixed. Working nights on a rotating basis has greater negative effects on sleep length than permanent night shifts, and working overnight shifts is typically more disruptive to sleep than either early-morning or evening shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When shifts are rotating, most individuals are better able to adjust to forward-rotating shifts, particularly if the speed of rotation is slower (&gt;4 days per shift) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Shift workers experience a range of sleep difficulties, including fragmented sleep, difficulty falling and staying asleep, poor sleep quality, and reduced sleep duration. Shift work can be a precipitating factor for insomnia, or it may exacerbate pre-existing insomnia symptoms. In a large epidemiological study, 19 percent of night workers reported clinically significant insomnia, which was more than twice the reported rate in day workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Insomnia has been associated with adverse functioning in workers, including increased absenteeism, reduced work productivity, and increased injuries and illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900903\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms during wakefulness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During waking hours, shift workers are prone to sleepiness, decreased neurocognitive and psychomotor function, and emotional ability.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleepiness &ndash; At least 75 percent of shift workers report some level of sleepiness during work, though not all exhibit significant impairments (approximately one-third meet criteria for shift work disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A subset of these sleepy workers report accidental dozing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], sometimes with fatal consequences, as night-shift workers are often involved in safety-sensitive occupations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognition &ndash; Sleepiness impairs a range of cognitive functions, including vigilance, cognitive flexibility, error detection and correction, processing speed, logical reasoning, learning, and creativity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychomotor function &ndash; Performance on tasks requiring psychomotor control, such as high-precision tasks and driving, are often adversely impacted in shift work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social and affective function &ndash; Chronic sleep restriction in shift workers may lead to affective instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Sleep-deprived brains are less able to regulate emotions, particularly those that are negatively valenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In other words, shift workers may experience stress more intensely, which is further exacerbated by impaired stress management due to sleep difficulties.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3230245969\"><span class=\"h2\">Accidents and errors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In combination, these impairments can increase risk for accidents, injury, and even death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Shift workers are at increased risk for impaired driving, including falling asleep at the wheel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This may be particularly relevant for night and early-morning shift workers, who are mostly likely to be commuting during times of extreme sleepiness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drowsy driving: Risks, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adverse events related to shift work in medical personnel include increased diagnostic and medication errors and increased rates of patient death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In one study, rotating shift workers were found to have twice as many work-related accidents compared with day workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another study of medical interns, the relative risk of percutaneous injuries was approximately 60 percent higher in night-shift interns compared with day-shift interns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97301797\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse health outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shift work has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>]. A meta-analysis of 34 observational studies including over 2 million people found small but significant associations between shift work and myocardial infarction (risk ratio [RR] 1.2) and ischemic stroke (RR 1.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other studies have reported an increased risk of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], diabetes (RR 1.1 to 1.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and breast cancer (RR 1.09) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].</p><p>Psychiatric morbidities such as depression and anxiety are common among shift workers and may relate to the fact that mood regulation is also impacted by circadian misalignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900940\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Essential aspects of the evaluation include a sleep history, safety risk assessment and sleep logs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> actigraphy when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Polysomnography is only necessary if there is clinical suspicion for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other sleep disorders that may be contributing to poor sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304329180\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers should include an assessment of work history (eg, occupation, work schedule, years of shift work), a detailed sleep history (including daytime and nighttime sleep difficulties), level of sleepiness using standardized measures (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), accidental dozing (particularly while driving), and any performance impairment during work shifts. Patients should be asked about sleep hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114597 \">table 1</a>) and use of medications or substances that may impact sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114598 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The history should also probe for symptoms of comorbid sleep disorders, such as OSA, narcolepsy, restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis-Ekbom</span> disease, and parasomnias. This includes questions about loud or habitual snoring, witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations or sleep paralysis, an uncomfortable urge to move the legs, and abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep. The clinical features and diagnosis of these disorders are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H69787559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Periodic limb movements of sleep'</a>.)</p><p>Validated questionnaires for the assessment of sleep-wake disturbances are useful to better characterize symptom severity and follow symptoms over time. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is commonly used for assessing sleep disturbances and can be applied separately for nighttime versus daytime sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A score of &ge;10 on the ISI is indicative of clinically significant insomnia. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is also validated and commonly used for assessing sleepiness during wakefulness (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), with a score &ge;10 indicative of excessive sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Circadian preference may be assessed clinically or with validated questionnaires. Circadian preference, or chronotype, refers to the extent to which individuals have a morning preference (ie, &quot;morning lark&quot; or early chronotype) versus a nocturnal preference (ie, &quot;night owl&quot; or late chronotype). A mismatch between chronotype and shift type (eg, an early chronotype working the night shift) is associated with worse adaptation to shift schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The Munich Chronotype Questionnaire for Shift Workers (MCTQShift) is validated for shift workers and yields a continuous measure of chronotype based on sleep behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Information on chronotype may inform treatment strategies (eg, support in adjusting to shift work versus terminating shift work), particularly for individuals with extreme chronotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900947\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep log</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of a sleep log is the mainstay of the evaluation of patients with sleep-wake disturbances related to shift work. A sleep log or diary should be completed prospectively for two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Either the 24-hour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104097\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef104097 \">form 1</a>) or the consensus sleep diary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 4</a>) can be used. The 24-hour diary visually depicts abnormalities of sleep timing and therefore may be more useful when circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are suspected. Conversely, the consensus sleep diary is preferred for the evaluation of insomnia.</p><p>Information from the sleep log can be used to further characterize sleep patterns on work days, off days, transition to work days, and transition to off days. Sleep metrics are recorded longitudinally on the sleep diary and can be summarized quantitatively, providing higher resolution compared with retrospective self-report. Quantitative data often include average sleep efficiency, sleep-onset latency, wake timing following sleep onset, frequency of night awakenings, and sleep quality. These variables can also be charted over time to monitor response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900953\"><span class=\"h2\">Actigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Actigraphy is a viable alternative to sleep logs in patients who have difficulty with self-reported sleep, or when there are inconsistencies between symptom presentation and self-reported sleep.</p><p>Actigraphy is usually obtained via a wrist-worn device, placed on the nondominant hand, that measures movement and (with some models) light exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F113942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113942 \">figure 2</a>). Actigraphy can be paired with sleep diaries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 4</a>) and has been shown to be comparable to polysomnography (PSG) for evaluation of total sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Actigraphy can also be a useful outcome measure in evaluating response to treatment. Attention should be directed to both daytime and nighttime sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-actigraphy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of actigraphy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900959\"><span class=\"h2\">Melatonin sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hourly salivary melatonin sampling can be used to determine onset and offset of endogenous melatonin as an index of circadian phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], although it is not routinely performed in clinical settings due to inconvenience and cost. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-circadian-sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders#H3386205439\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders&quot;, section on 'Melatonin sampling'</a>.) </p><p>Individuals who are adjusted to shift work should show melatonin onset following their night shift and close to the desired time for sleep during the day. Information regarding circadian phase may also be used to enhance the precision and efficiency of light therapy. (See <a href=\"#H9901056\" class=\"local\">'Circadian re-alignment strategies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900965\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSG is not required unless there is clinical suspicion for OSA or other sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. These comorbidities are relevant and important to diagnose, because interventions that aim to realign a shift worker's circadian phase with their work schedule will not adequately address other potential sleep disorders that are contributing to sleep disturbances or sleepiness. </p><p>If performed, PSG should ideally be timed to match the individual's longest or least disturbed usual sleep time (whether during the day or night).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3999678162\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shift work disorder is defined in the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a report of insomnia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive sleepiness, accompanied by a reduction of total sleep time, which is associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps with the usual time for sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms have been present and associated with the shift work schedule for at least three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in mental, physical, social, occupational, education, or other important areas of functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep log and actigraphy monitoring (whenever possible and preferably with concurrent measurement of light exposure) for at least 14 days (work and free days) demonstrate a disturbed sleep and wake pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wake disturbance are not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, mental disorder, medication use, poor sleep hygiene, or substance use disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9900971\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to engaging in symptomatic management, patients with shift work disorder (SWD) should understand that elimination of shift work should resolve symptoms, and therefore a change in work schedule should be considered as an option when possible. Sleep and well-being improve significantly when extreme chronotypes are precluded from working mismatched shifts (ie, night shifts for extreme early chronotypes, and morning shifts for extreme late chronotypes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-wake-disturbances-in-shift-workers/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Since implementation of such changes may be limited in the workplace, it may help to provide a letter on the patient's behalf in severe cases, explaining the disorder and its consequences.</p><p>Interventions for sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies. We generally proceed in a stepwise fashion, focusing first on improving daytime sleep and then addressing residual complaints of sleepiness or impaired function during the night shift. Safety should always be prioritized in treatment strategies. </p><p>More limited data on circadian realignment strategies using bright light <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> melatonin suggest that these interventions may also be worth trying in motivated patients. (See <a href=\"#H9901056\" class=\"local\">'Circadian re-alignment strategies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194195259\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep scheduling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A regular sleep schedule that can be followed even during off-work periods is encouraged in order to promote stability in circadian entrainment. This may need to be individualized, as shift workers often require flexibility in order to meet varying social and family obligations.</p><p>While a consolidated seven to nine hours of sleep is recommended, daytime sleep can be separated into two bouts in order to accommodate the need for flexibility: the first, a regularized three- to four-hour &quot;anchor&quot; sleep that takes priority, and a second bout that can vary around other responsibilities (total sleep should fall between seven to nine hours).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304329237\"><span class=\"h2\">Improving daytime sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shift workers who are experiencing sleep-wake disturbances of any level of severity can benefit from interventions aimed at improving daytime sleep. The initial approach involves review of environmental and scheduling factors to promote better sleep (ie, sleep hygiene). For patients with persistent difficulties obtaining adequate sleep, options include use of a short-acting hypnotic agent, exogenous melatonin, and behavioral treatment of insomnia. The choice among these depends on availability and cost, presence of contraindications, and patient preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1385806728\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sleep environment should be modified to promote consolidated daytime sleep, with particular attention to light, temperature, and noise level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F114597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114597 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Light-blocking shades should be used to reduce as much sunlight as possible, with cool ambient temperature (generally between 60 to 75&deg;F).
