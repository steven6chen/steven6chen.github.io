Patients may not be forthcoming about suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts; in addition, patients may present with major depression and not recall prior episodes of mania or hypomania, especially if these last occurred several years in the past or with peripartum onset, or were marked by irritability rather than euphoria. Patients who present with mania, hypomania, or psychosis often have poor insight and difficulty providing a history.</p><p>Several types of general medical disorders (eg, endocrine or neurologic) can cause bipolar disorder. Findings from the general medical history or physical examination that suggest a general medical condition in patients with bipolar disorder are the same findings that occur in patients without bipolar disorder. Additional laboratory testing, such as brain imaging or electroencephalography (EEG), is guided by abnormal findings in the history and examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

In addition, studies in unipolar major depression indicate that screening is beneficial only in settings that can provide follow-up to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults#H265061466\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;, section on 'Effectiveness of screening'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86800123\"><span class=\"h3\">Mania and hypomania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bipolar screening instruments do not appear to perform well enough to warrant routine use, particularly in psychiatric outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most widely used and translated measure that screens for a lifetime history of manic or hypomanic episodes is the 15-item, self-report Mood Disorder Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F53409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53409 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20-22</a>].

Thus, the questionnaire should not be used as a diagnostic proxy for case finding; patients who screen positive require a diagnostic interview to make the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The Mood Disorder Questionnaire appears to be even less useful in screening for bipolar II disorder than bipolar I disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A pooled analysis of 12 studies (n &gt;600 patients) found that the sensitivity for bipolar I disorder was 66 percent, but for bipolar II disorder the sensitivity was only 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Detecting bipolar II disorder is better accomplished with the 32-item Hypomanic Checklist than the Mood Disorder Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>].</p><p>The long-term reliability of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire is also limited. A study found that the ability of the instrument to detect manic and hypomanic episodes after two years had elapsed was poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>In a primary care setting, the sensitivity of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire was fair (58 percent) and specificity excellent (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, a pooled analysis of four studies conducted in primary care or general population settings (n &gt;2100 individuals screened) found that the sensitivity and specificity was 43 and 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In addition, psychosocial functioning in hypomania is either mildly impaired or improved, whereas functioning in mania is markedly impaired.
