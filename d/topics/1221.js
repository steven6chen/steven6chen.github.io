The causes range from developmental and dietary factors (eg, excessive consumption of juice), to diseases causing malabsorption or maldigestion, disordered immune regulation, or enteric infections (particularly in immunocompromised patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56837 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>In resource-limited countries, chronic diarrhea typically is associated with serial enteric infections and malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This common pathophysiology calls for a distinct algorithmic approach to diagnosis and treatment, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The diagnostic approach to diarrheal diseases in resource-rich countries will be reviewed here. The causes of these diarrheal diseases are discussed separately.

This typically translates to persistent loose or watery stools occurring at least three times a day, where the change in stool consistency is more important than stool frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. To be considered chronic, the symptom must be present for four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Some have used two weeks to define chronicity in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selection of the appropriate strategy to diagnose the cause of chronic diarrhea in a child depends on the presentation of the patient. In most cases, a thorough history and physical examination narrows the range of possibilities. Age at presentation and the population setting (eg, the genetic predisposition of the population) are also important factors to consider. For children presenting with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich countries, the most likely cause in young children (typically one to four years of age) is functional diarrhea. In this young age group, functional diarrhea is also known as chronic nonspecific diarrhea or &quot;toddler's diarrhea.&quot; In older children and adolescents, functional diarrhea is associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as defined by the pediatric Rome IV criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Celiac disease is also relatively common, and can be evaluated with a simple serologic screening test. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider these entities early in the evaluation before embarking on extensive laboratory testing. If these steps do not establish a diagnosis, then further laboratory testing can be selected based on history, physical examination, and the stool type. This stepwise strategy is outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60860%7EPEDS%2F64254\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60860 graphicRef64254 \">algorithm 1A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed history often provides clues to the diagnosis or diagnostic category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81662 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of onset &ndash; Neonatal onset of watery diarrhea strongly suggests one of the congenital diarrheas. Chronic diarrheas triggered by an infectious insult (including post-infectious lactose intolerance or antibiotic-associated diarrhea) typically have an acute onset. Gradual onset of a mild chronic diarrhea in an otherwise healthy toddler suggests functional diarrhea (chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhood) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The onset of symptoms in celiac disease varies greatly, but cannot precede the introduction of gluten-containing foods. Diarrhea that has a consistent temporal relationship (eg, within 24 hours) to eating a specific food may reflect lactose intolerance or food allergy. Food allergy may be either immediate-type hypersensitivity (immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated), or delayed-type hypersensitivity (non-IgE-mediated, such as food-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">enteropathy/proctocolitis)</span>. Medications should also be considered as more than 700 drugs are implicated in causing diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71449 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Diarrheal stools that are passed at night are more concerning for an underlying organic disorder. Stools that contain visible or occult blood or mucus suggest an inflammatory diarrhea, which may be caused by a dietary protein intolerance (common in infants), inflammatory bowel disease, or (rarely) chronic infection with an enteric pathogen. A history of small-volume fecal incontinence should prompt questions to determine if occult constipation might be present. This is sometimes misinterpreted as diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Weight loss is also a common feature of inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A history of recurrent infections suggests underlying immunodeficiency or cystic fibrosis. Dyspepsia and vomiting may call the attention to unrecognized constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/12,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history &ndash; A family history of disease affecting the bowel may provide clues to heritable diseases, but a negative family history does not exclude genetic origins, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal examination &ndash; Severe abdominal pain or abdominal distension may be caused by intestinal obstruction or enterocolitis, particularly if blood is present in the stools. These symptoms occurring in a child with chronic diarrhea or chronic constipation call for an urgent evaluation for obstruction and infection. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following laboratory tests are available to narrow the diagnostic possibilities and establish a diagnosis. We suggest selecting from among these tests according to a stepwise diagnostic approach as outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Celiac serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most valuable test is for immunoglobulin A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-tTG), which is highly sensitive, specific, and more cost-effective than other antibody tests in the presence of a normal serum IgA. False-positive and false-negative results may still occur with some frequency in populations with a low risk for celiac disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool pH, electrolytes, and reducing substances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For watery stools, fecal electrolyte concentrations and pH are measured in stool water after homogenization of a fresh specimen (by manual stirring or in a mechanical blender) and centrifugation of an aliquot to obtain supernatant for analysis. Fecal pH is measured with nitrazine paper on a fresh stool sample.</p><p>The osmotic gap of fecal fluid can be used to estimate the relative contributions of electrolytes and nonelectrolyte osmoles to retention of water in the intestinal lumen. In osmotic diarrhea, nonelectrolytes cause water retention. The osmotic gap is calculated from electrolyte concentrations in stool water by the following formula: 290 - 2([Na+] + [K+]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51596 \">table 4</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-stool-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). This formula is preferred over those that use measured stool osmolalities, because the latter may be falsely elevated due to post-collection bacterial fermentation or to contamination of the sample with concentrated urine.</p><p>The stool can be tested for reducing substances, which if present suggest carbohydrate malabsorption. Glucose, lactose, and fructose are reducing sugars, but sucrose is not. However, malabsorbed sucrose also can be degraded by colonic bacteria to glucose and fructose, resulting in a positive test for reducing substances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fecal calprotectin and occult blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fecal calprotectin levels are increased in intestinal inflammation and often are useful for distinguishing inflammatory from noninflammatory causes of chronic diarrhea. However, test characteristics vary depending on the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the study population. Thus, the test may be used to focus the next stage of the investigation, but results should not be interpreted to firmly include or exclude any disease or disease category. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;, section on 'Fecal calprotectin'</a>.)</p><p>Tests of stool for occult blood has low sensitivity and specificity for detecting inflammatory processes. As an example, in addition to inflammatory bowel diseases and enteric pathogens, a substantial number of individuals with celiac disease or diarrhea due to rotavirus infection also test positive for occult fecal blood. Functional diarrhea or diarrhea caused by laxative abuse is less likely to contain occult blood. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) <a href=\"http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(99)70513-5/fulltext&amp;token=vopbpe5EOafFTZeXuZ3m7CqwsMoW5QeHibYyxY5Ov4FaX7lxzz+Sd5+/n7V4Jg/dzfJCY6/rYwzhzw19bonCe8/NgXCSVBMOKYpu1nFWEpc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5881\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Technical review on the evaluation and management of chronic diarrhea</a> (including a discussion on occult blood) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], as well as other AGA guidelines, can be accessed through the AGA Web site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of tests can be used to detect fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). The gold standard for diagnosis of steatorrhea is quantitative estimation of stool fat, usually performed over 72 hours, while the patient eats a diet containing at least 100 g of fat per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;, section on 'Tests for fat malabsorption'</a>.)</p><p>Because 72-hour stool collection is cumbersome, qualitative tests also are used as a screening tool to detect steatorrhea. These include the Sudan III stain and acid steatocrit, a rapid gravimetric method. The utility of the Sudan III test is limited by variability in its performance and interpretation; one study reported sensitivity 77 percent and specificity 98 percent for this method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Clinical suspicion of the following disease processes calls for specific testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease &ndash; (eg, grossly bloody stools, growth failure, or family history of IBD). Measure complete blood count, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Perform contrast radiography of the small bowel (or magnetic resonance imaging), and upper and lower endoscopy depending on degree of clinical suspicion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein-losing gastroenteropathy &ndash; (eg, reduced serum concentrations of albumin and gamma globulins, peripheral edema).

Perform sweat chloride testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatic insufficiency &ndash; (eg, suspicion of cystic fibrosis or marked steatorrhea). Perform indirect tests of pancreatic function, including measurement of fecal elastase-1 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chymotrypsin; the stool content of these enzymes is reduced in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnostic accuracy of these tests is low and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factitious diarrhea &ndash; (eg, suspicion of laxative abuse, hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis, or factitious diarrhea). Perform a laxative screen if available, and measure the stool osmolality. The measured stool osmolality is elevated in the presence of osmotically active laxatives (&gt;290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg),</span> and is reduced (&lt;290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg)</span> if the sample is contaminated with water or dilute urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-diarrhea-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious diarrhea: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool Giardia antigen &ndash; Giardiasis is the most common enteric parasitic infection in the United States.

We suggest screening with serum testing for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Many providers also test serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels at the same time to avoid the possibility of a false-negative result in the case of IgA deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Consider functional diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with functional diarrhea (sometimes called chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhood or toddler's diarrhea) typically present with the following characteristics (which constitute the &quot;Rome IV&quot; diagnostic criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily painless, recurrent passage of four or more large, unformed stools</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms last more than four weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of diarrhea between 6 and 60 months of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No failure to thrive (if caloric intake is adequate)</p><p/><p>Previous guidelines suggested that stools are passed only during waking hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, this is no longer considered a diagnostic criterion because about 25 percent of children with functional diarrhea pass stools while they are asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After exclusion of celiac disease and Giardiasis (when appropriate), children with these characteristics can be given a provisional diagnosis of functional diarrhea. In some cases, functional diarrhea is caused by excessive intake of osmotically active carbohydrates (eg, apple, prune, or pear juices, &quot;sugar-free&quot; foods containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a>, or high quantities of fructose) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restriction of fat from the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>]. If the diet history suggests this possibility, we suggest an empiric trial of restricting juices and liberalizing dietary fat to 35 to 50 percent of total calories. Response to this dietary intervention supports the diagnosis of functional diarrhea and no further intervention is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Functional diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective testing according to stool type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the diagnosis remains unclear after the above maneuvers, the next step is to narrow the diagnostic possibilities with clues from the history and by categorizing stool type.</p><p>Although diarrhea is defined by excess water content, its clinical appearance typically falls into categories that inform further diagnostic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53143 \">table 5</a>). Thus, a first step in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea is to determine whether the stool is watery, fatty, or inflammatory. In some cases, the stool will have a mixed appearance, requiring an evaluation that spans more than one category. As an example, diarrheal diseases of infectious origin commonly have watery and inflammatory components. Gross inspection of stool may be helpful, but laboratory testing usually will be necessary to categorize the stool accurately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Watery (osmotic versus secretory)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The water content of chronic diarrhea can be caused by secretory or osmotic processes, or a combination of the two. These categories are useful to narrow the diagnostic possibilities. However, the clinical utility of these categories and their diagnostic markers is limited because some diarrheal diseases involve a combination of both processes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-diarrhea-in-children#H52441743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute diarrhea in children&quot;, section on 'Diarrhea classification'</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing between these processes by measurement of fecal electrolytes, pH, reducing substances, and calculation of the osmotic gap helps to distinguish between these mechanisms and to categorize the cause of the diarrhea.

Consequently, it is helpful to assess the effects of fasting on stool output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pure secretory diarrheas are uncommon, but can occur in the setting of certain enteric infections, some congenital diarrheas, and some neuroendocrine tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57351\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57351 \">algorithm 1E</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-children#H4052321254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children&quot;, section on 'Stool tests'</a>.)</p><p>If the stools contain substantial amounts of gross blood, the differential diagnosis includes noninflammatory sources of blood in the GI tract (eg, Meckel's diverticulum), as well as enteric pathogens (eg, C. difficile) and chronic inflammatory diseases (eg, dietary protein intolerance and inflammatory bowel disease).

Quantitative and qualitative fecal fat tests are most accurate in patients with severe fat malabsorption caused by pancreatic insufficiency or bile acid secretory defects. Tests of fecal fat have low sensitivity and specificity for patients with other diarrheal diseases. Thus, these tests may be used as diagnostic clues to determine the order of an evaluation, but are not sufficient to definitively narrow the diagnostic possibilities. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Stool fat'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the initial categorization of the diarrhea, the differential diagnosis becomes more manageable, and a more focused series of investigations can be pursued (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53143 \">table 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Infectious and structural diseases that are consistent with the patient's history should be excluded first. Consecutively, specific tests guided by the initial categorization should be performed, followed by endoscopy and genetic testing if necessary to confirm the diagnosis and aid management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64254%7EPEDS%2F67133%7EPEDS%2F56277%7EPEDS%2F57351\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64254 graphicRef67133 graphicRef56277 graphicRef57351 \">algorithm 1B-E</a>).

Sufficient calories should be provided to allow for catch-up weight gain. When oral intake is inadequate or malabsorption precludes the necessary intake, continuous enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition may be required. Parenteral nutrition should be undertaken as soon as other, less invasive nutritional approaches have been shown to be unsuccessful.</p><p>Micronutrient and vitamin supplementation are part of nutritional rehabilitation, especially in malnourished children from resource-limited countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Children with chronic diarrhea and malnutrition are often deficient in vitamin A, zinc, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a>, copper, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">selenium</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can impair the function of the immune system and have a direct effect on the structure and function of mucosa. Zinc deficiency is a particular risk because of increased losses through the gastrointestinal tract during episodes of diarrhea, and empiric replacement of zinc is recommended for children with diarrhea and malnutrition (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>). The therapeutic foods or formulas designed by the World Health Organization (WHO) provide sufficient vitamins and minerals to replace the common deficiencies, and additional supplementation is not needed if the malnutrition is managed with the WHO protocols, except in unusual circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;, section on 'Vitamin and mineral supplementation'</a>.) </p><p><strong>Diet</strong> &ndash; When lactose intolerance, sucrase deficiency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> food allergy or food-protein-induced <span class=\"nowrap\">enteropathy/proctocolitis</span> is suspected, we suggest excluding the suspected offending food from the diet for 7 to 10 days. If possible, the family should keep a dietary record before and after the dietary change to assure compliance. A lactose breath hydrogen test usually is not helpful, because the presence of lactose malabsorption does not predict lactose intolerance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, treatment for chronic diarrhea is directed at the specific cause, once it is established (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a>), and related topic reviews. However, a few general approaches are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many diarrheal diseases are associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota. An attempt at modifying this altered bacterial population may be worth considering, even when an infectious cause is suspected but not proven. Two distinct strategies are available: the administration of probiotic bacteria and the administration of antibiotics. Randomized studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated modest efficacy of specific probiotics in the prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and treatment of acute diarrhea in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There is limited evidence, however, that probiotics are effective in treating chronic pediatric diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Probiotics for gastrointestinal diseases&quot;</a>).

For example, these agents may prolong excretion of the organism or increase the risk of developing hemolytic-uremic syndrome in patients with enterohemorrhagic <em>Escherichia coli</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Treatment and prevention in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not recommend the use of these or other antimotility drugs for children with chronic diarrhea, except in unusual circumstances to facilitate fluid management, when the cause of the diarrhea has been established (eg, irritable bowel syndrome), and the medication is administered under careful supervision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatostatin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment may be directed at modifying specific pathophysiologic processes. In severe secretory diarrheas for instance (such as in neuroendocrine tumors, microvillous inclusion disease, and enterotoxin-induced severe diarrhea), a trial with somatostatin or its analogue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">octreotide</a>, may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Octreotide has been used in diarrhea caused by neoplastic diseases and in intestinal infections. It also has been shown to be effective in reducing fecal output in HIV-infected children with severe cryptosporidiosis. In vitro tests have shown that octreotide has a specific antagonist effect against the enterotoxin associated with Cryptosporidium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3599033364\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
