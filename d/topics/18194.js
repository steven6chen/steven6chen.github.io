The cytoplasmic tail of this protein is then cleaved to release soluble TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is important for macrophage activation, phagosome activation, differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, and granuloma formation and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Animal experiments have demonstrated the importance of TNF-alpha in protection against several pathogens, including <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>M. avium</em>, <em>M. bovis</em>, Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG), <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, and <em>Candida albicans </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

TNF-alpha is required for the orderly recruitment of these cells and for continued maintenance and function of the granuloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11650657\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of recommendations have been issued regarding screening for certain infections, including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, prior to using a TNF-alpha inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

If a TNF-alpha inhibitor is started in a patient with chronic HBV infection, antiviral therapy should be used concomitantly. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B'</a> below.)</p><p>Decisions about the appropriate timing for initiating a TNF-alpha inhibitor following resolution of the infections described above should be made on a case-by-case basis. For some infections (eg, coccidioidomycosis, pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria), resolution can be difficult to identify or document, and the decision regarding anti-TNF therapy resumption or initiation (potentially with concomitant antimicrobial therapy) should be made in conjunction with an infectious diseases specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING THE RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from randomized trials and long-term open-label extension studies of biologic therapies have generally (but not always) suggested some increase in infectious risks associated with these compounds. While these studies have the benefit of being randomized with regard to drug exposure at the start of the study, they are often small, include relatively healthy patients (ie, lacking comorbidities), and are underpowered to evaluate uncommon events. In addition, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and certain other inflammatory diseases have higher rates of pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and other serious infections due to the underlying disease itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The majority of these infections are thought to be bacterial, although community-acquired viruses (eg, influenza) likely also play an important role.</p><p>A 2011 network meta-analysis that included 50,010 patients from 163 randomized trials and 46 long-term open-label extension studies (some of which involved biologic agents other than TNF-alpha inhibitors) showed an elevated risk of serious infections (ie, infections requiring hospitalization) for each TNF-alpha inhibitor, although the risk was only statistically significant for certolizumab (odds ratio [OR] 3.51, 95% CI 1.59-7.79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A 2015 meta-analysis that included 106 randomized trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received biologic drugs found that standard-dose biologic drugs (OR 1.31, 95% credible interval 1.09-1.58) and high-dose biologic drugs (OR 1.90, 95% credible interval 1.50-2.39) were associated with an increased risk of serious infections compared with traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but low-dose biologic drugs were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The risk was lower in patients who were methotrexate-naive compared with those who had previously received a traditional DMARD or a TNF-alpha inhibitor.</p><p>In general, observational studies have the benefit of evaluating risk in &quot;real-world&quot; populations and often have great statistical power. Given the lack of randomization, however, confounding can skew results, although several elegant studies have used propensity scores and other methods in an attempt to control for this. Many registry and population-based studies have documented &quot;real-world&quot; incidence rates of infection. Most, but not all, of these studies have suggested an increased risk in infection requiring hospitalization in patients receiving a TNF-alpha inhibitor, particularly during the first 6 to 12 months after drug initiation. Incidence rates from a selection of these population-based studies range from 2.9 to 8.2 infections requiring hospitalization per 100 patient-years of exposure to a TNF-alpha inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Several studies suggest a higher risk of infection requiring hospitalization with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, although it is unclear whether this is due to the drug itself or differences in concomitant immunosuppressive use or other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>Perhaps the most robust analysis with regard to controlling for differences between exposed populations before and after drug initiation comes from the German biologic registry. After controlling for concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use in time-varying fashion as well as for various comorbidities, a statistically significant increased risk (incidence rate ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) for infection requiring hospitalization was found to be associated with TNF-alpha inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The investigators developed a risk calculator and showed that the majority of infection risk is related to patient factors (ie, comorbidities and age) and concomitant use of prednisone.</p><p>Other population-based studies in the United States have had some variability in risk estimates. In a large retrospective population-based study using Medicare, health-plan, and health maintenance organization data in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis, no increase in the risk of hospitalization for infection was observed in patients initiating treatment with a TNF-alpha inhibitor compared with nonbiologic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among patients with RA, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> was associated with an increased risk of serious infections compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.26, 95% CI 1.07-1.47) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (aHR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.48). An accompanying editorial pointed out that possible reasons for the lack of difference in the risk of hospitalization include multiple potential confounders in both treatment groups as well as the possibility that the infection rate in the comparator group may have been higher than in prior studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration has stated that patients receiving a TNF-alpha inhibitor who are greater than 65 years of age or who are taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at even greater risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The absolute risks are higher for older adults, although the relative risk between TNF-alpha inhibitors and nonbiologic DMARDs in this group remains similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. Some comorbidities can also elevate the risk of serious infections substantially. As an example, in the United States population-based analysis described above, the crude incidence of infections requiring hospitalization for patients taking a TNF-alpha inhibitor without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was 7.2 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 6.5-8.1), whereas it was more than twice as high (15.0 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 11.8-18.9) in those with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Most studies of infections in patients receiving TNF-alpha inhibitors have been conducted in adults. In a systematic review of studies that focused on children and adolescents receiving a TNF-alpha inhibitor for juvenile idiopathic arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, the most frequently reported infections were upper respiratory tract infections and other mild infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Severe bacterial and fungal infections also occurred.

One hundred seventy-nine patients who received a TNF-alpha inhibitor had at least one episode of septic arthritis compared with 20 patients who received DMARDs. The adjusted hazard ratio for septic arthritis in patients who received a TNF-alpha inhibitor was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.4). The risk was highest in the early months following initiation of TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy and did not differ based upon which TNF-alpha inhibitor was used.</p><p><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> was the most common cause of septic arthritis in both cohorts, occurring in 57 percent of patients who received a TNF-alpha inhibitor and 43 percent of patients who received DMARDs. In the patients who received a TNF-alpha inhibitor, several cases were caused by organisms that rarely cause septic arthritis, including five cases caused by intracellular pathogens (three cases caused by <em>Salmonella</em> spp and two cases caused by <em>Listeria </em>spp) and four cases caused by <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.

Several large population-based studies have been conducted, with those conducted in United States not finding an increased risk with TNF-alpha inhibitors but those in Europe generally showing an increased risk. The largest study to address this issue was a multicenter cohort study performed in the United States that compared the incidence of herpes zoster in 33,324 patients initiating a TNF-alpha inhibitor and 25,742 patients initiating nonbiologic DMARDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>); underlying diseases included rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

A later analysis from the British Biologic Registry identified a significantly increased risk (HR between 1.5 [95% CI 1.1-2.0] and 2.2 [95% CI 1.4-3.4]) for the three TNF-alpha inhibitors evaluated (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

However, the risk of herpes zoster in patients receiving a TNF-alpha inhibitor does not appear to be higher than in patients receiving nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>).

Clinicians caring for patients in regions that are endemic for invasive fungal infections must maintain a high degree of suspicion for the occurrence of such complications. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Fungal infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases of <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP) have been reported among patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors.

(See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy with anakinra'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should ensure that patients are up to date on vaccinations before starting a course of TNF-alpha inhibition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91884 \">table 1</a>). Live virus vaccines should <strong>not</strong> be administered to patients receiving therapy with a TNF-alpha inhibitor.
