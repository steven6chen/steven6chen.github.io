The purpose of the preparative regimen is twofold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To provide adequate immunosuppression to prevent rejection of the transplanted graft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To eradicate the disease for which the transplant is being performed</p><p/><p>These goals have traditionally been achieved by delivering maximally tolerated doses of multiple chemotherapeutic agents with non-overlapping toxicities, with or without radiation. Several novel approaches have been evaluated in an attempt to minimize toxicity. As an example, nonmyeloablative preparative regimens have been developed to treat older patients or those with concurrent medical conditions. </p><p>The toxicity associated with preparative regimens and an overview of the more common regimens currently in use will be presented here. The preferred preparative regimen for specific diseases and the approaches to prevention of the other major complications of hematopoietic cell transplantation (eg, graft-versus-host disease) are discussed separately. There are also occasional settings in which transplantation can be performed without any preparation, primarily in children with severe combined immunodeficiency who lack T cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATIVE REGIMEN INTENSITY DEFINED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have variable intensity, toxicity, and dependence upon a graft-versus-tumor effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F87814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87814 \">figure 1</a>). Preparative regimens for HCT have been termed myeloablative, reduced intensity, and nonmyeloablative. While full agreement has not been achieved, generally accepted definitions of these three types of regimens are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myeloablative regimens</strong> &ndash; A myeloablative (MA) regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and results in profound pancytopenia within one to three weeks from the time of administration. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting, usually irreversible, and in most instances fatal, unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. Examples include total body irradiation &ge;5 Gy in a single dose or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Myeloablative preparative regimens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonmyeloablative regimens</strong> &ndash; A nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimen is one that will cause minimal cytopenia (but significant lymphopenia) by itself and does not require stem cell support. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> with or without antithymocyte globulin or total body irradiation &le;2 Gy with or without a purine analog. However, the transplant, when given in this setting, usually becomes myeloablative because the engrafting donor T cells will eventually eliminate host hematopoietic cells, allowing the establishment of donor hematopoiesis. (See <a href=\"#H89394696\" class=\"local\">'Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity preparative regimens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced intensity regimens</strong> &ndash; Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens are an intermediate category of regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Such regimens cause cytopenias, which may be prolonged and result in significant morbidity and mortality, and require hematopoietic stem cell support. Regimens generally considered as reduced intensity include &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, or &le;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>.</p><p/><p>Importantly, this nomenclature was designed to reflect the acute regimen related toxicity rather than the overall efficacy of the transplant on the underlying disease state. In addition, these definitions serve only as guidelines and it is often difficult in practice to know what impact a regimen will have in the absence of transplantation. Multicenter randomized trials are necessary to better compare the efficacy and toxicity of these regimens in particular disease states. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89394187\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF PREPARATIVE REGIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard choice of preparative regimen for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and clinical practice varies across countries and institutions. It is difficult to compare the relative efficacy of the large number of different preparative regimens that have been developed, since there are few direct comparisons in randomized clinical trials. In addition, it is likely that patient selection has a large impact on the results obtained, making it difficult to assess the impact of any given preparative regimen from the large number of phase II trials reported in the literature. Instead, a decision regarding preparative regimen is based upon clinical judgement that takes into account details regarding the recipient comorbidities, underlying condition and disease status, donor, and graft source. The following general principles apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recipient comorbidities</strong> &ndash; A patient's underlying comorbidities often dictate the type of conditioning regimen that may be offered. Patients with substantial comorbidities and older patients are not candidates for myeloablative conditioning regimens, but may be candidates for a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen or a nonmyeloablative regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Underlying condition</strong> &ndash; Eradication of the malignant or abnormal hematopoietic stem cells is a goal of the preparative regimen for patients with hematologic malignancies or hyperplastic marrows (eg, thalassemia). In contrast, for patients with severe aplastic anemia or certain immunodeficiency states (eg, SCID), eradication is not required and the preparative regimen is primarily focused on immunosuppression to allow engraftment. While myeloablative regimens would be preferred in the former, less intensive regimens may be appropriate for the latter. In addition, underlying genetic disorders predisposing to conditions requiring transplant may impact the choice of preparative regimen. As an example, patients with Fanconi anemia are particularly susceptible to the toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation, necessitating the use of RIC regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for idiopathic severe aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease status</strong> &ndash; Myeloablative regimens are preferred for patients with hematologic malignancies that are not in complete remission at the time of transplantation. Total body irradiation may be preferred in some settings due to its potential eradication of tumor cells in sanctuary sites (eg, central nervous system, gonads) that are not penetrated by many chemotherapy agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of rejection</strong> &ndash; Graft rejection is more likely when there is increasing HLA disparity in major histocompatibility antigens (eg, HLA-mismatch), in recipients who have been exposed to minor histocompatability antigens (eg, multiple prior blood transfusions), following the infusion of grafts with a low stem cell dose, and with T cell depleted grafts. Graft rejection is less likely with increased stem cell dose, use of peripheral blood progenitor cells rather than bone marrow cells, high T cell dose in the graft, and the use of ATG in the preparative regimen. Graft rejection is not generally considered a risk in autologous HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H4260919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Importance of cell dose'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Often, myeloablative preparative regimens are preferred for young patients with a good performance status undergoing allogeneic HCT given the larger experience with these regimens. Myeloablative regimens are also the cornerstone of autologous HCT. Reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative regimens may be considered for patients who are not candidates for myeloablative regimens in whom the underlying disease has been well controlled. A choice among the various myeloablative regimens, nonmyeloablative regimens, and reduced intensity regimens is largely based upon center experience, resources available, and the principles described above.</p><p>Prospective randomized trials will be required to compare myeloablative with non-myeloablative regimens for the treatment of a particular disease. In general, myeloablative regimens are used for autologous HCT and in the allogeneic setting for the treatment of patients not in remission. Whether patients with leukemia in remission or patients with myelodysplastic syndrome require the high doses of myeloablative preparative regimens is currently unknown and will require prospective studies to answer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MYELOABLATIVE PREPARATIVE REGIMENS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89396143\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles and examples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, a myeloablative regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and results in profound pancytopenia within one to three weeks from the time of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

A lower dose is used in older patients (ie, &gt;70 years), those with renal dysfunction, or patients with multiple comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Preparative chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CVP </strong>&ndash; The CVP regimen combines a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a> (300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> followed by both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (600 to 2400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> to 7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> administered over four days. This regimen is also commonly used for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. </p><p/><p>A number of variations on these myeloablative regimens have been employed at centers throughout the world. They were developed by escalating the dose of either radiation or a particular drug to the maximally tolerated dose. Drugs with non-overlapping toxicities were employed in an effort to avoid synergistic injury to a particular organ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54359 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Preparative regimen intensity defined'</a> above.)</p><p>In all instances, hematopoietic toxicity was ignored and, since this system is the most sensitive to the effects of radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytotoxic chemotherapy, all regimens were associated with a high degree of myelotoxicity. The extent to which any particular regimen is in fact myeloablative is very hard to know with certainty. There are only a few randomized trials directly comparing the efficacy of one myeloablative preparative regimen with another. As a result, it is difficult to make direct statements about the suitability of a given preparative regimen in a particular disease setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89396547\"><span class=\"h2\">Common toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the myeloablative preparative regimens have side effects that can be life-threatening.

This can be addressed with sperm cryopreservation for male patients, assuming they have adequate sperm number and function. Embryo or oocyte cryopreservation in female patients can also be attempted, with generally less favorable results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary and hepatic toxicity are also relatively common. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, which is a component of many preparative regimens, can produce both interstitial lung disease and hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. As a result, it is imperative that patients be screened for comorbidities prior to initiating the preparative regimen to avoid unnecessary risk. Monitoring of busulphan pharmacokinetics can also reduce the risk of these complications.

Initial preparative regimens included TBI administered as a single dose using opposing Cobalt-60 sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At present, TBI-based regimens typically fractionate the radiation and administer the total dose over several days, typically four, which helps decrease toxicity and increase tolerability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90901 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Partial lung shielding is included in an effort to reduce the potential for irreversible lung injury.</p><p>The maximally tolerated dose of TBI is approximately 15 Gy. Higher doses produce excessive nonhematologic toxicity, primarily to the lungs, but also to other organs including the heart. Two randomized trials evaluated the efficacy of different doses of TBI (12 and 16 Gy) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, prior to allogeneic HCT in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission and chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Decreased relapse rates were observed with the higher TBI dose (eg, 12 versus 35 percent at three years in patients with acute myeloid leukemia), but overall survival was similar due primarily to increased transplant-related mortality at the higher doses (eg, 32 versus 12 percent at three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This observation has provided one of the major rationales for developing radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies as part of the preparative regimen. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p>In the initial regimens, TBI was combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (Cy) and this <span class=\"nowrap\">Cy/TBI</span> combination is still widely used. In <span class=\"nowrap\">Cy/TBI,</span> cyclophosphamide is usually given at a dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of adjusted ideal body weight on each of two successive days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Attempts at further intensification, either by increasing the TBI dose or adding other agents have been unsuccessful at improving overall survival largely due to an increase in non-relapse mortality. TBI has also been combined with other chemotherapy agents.

The rationale for this approach is to reduce the likelihood of relapse via the antileukemic activity of cytarabine. However, the possibility superiority of using cytarabine rather than cyclophosphamide remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p>Fractionated TBI has been relatively difficult to standardize in multi-institutional trials, due to differences in dose rates, shielding, and center-specific techniques. Dose rates differ by machine and lower total doses must be given when using machines with a high dose rate in order to limit toxicity. Fractionation reduces the incidence and severity of acute and late complications. Lower total doses may decrease toxicity but increase the risk of graft failure and disease recurrence. In contrast, higher doses decrease graft rejection and disease relapse but increase treatment-related morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The major limitations of fractionated TBI include mucositis, lung toxicity, infertility, and the relatively sophisticated instrumentation required to effectively administer this treatment.

The importance of GVT is illustrated by the different outcomes with grafts from identical twin and nonidentical donors. Patients who have an identical twin donor do not develop either graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or GVT, and are therefore at higher risk of relapse of the underlying malignant disease than similar patients transplanted with HLA-matched but nonidentical sibling donors (who develop both GVHD and GVT).

As a result, the possibility of achieving donor-specific engraftment using nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity regimens has been extensively explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3,55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,55-59</a>]. This approach, which relies more on donor cellular immune effects and less on the cytotoxic effects of the preparative regimen to control the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/54,60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,60-62</a>], permits transplantation in older, as well as high-risk, heavily pretreated patients of any age, with an attendant decrease in regimen-related toxicity and treatment-related mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/63-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-71</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Preparative regimen intensity defined'</a> above.)</p><p>In many instances, cancer cells cannot be eradicated entirely by high dose chemotherapy alone (eg, multiple myeloma), or patients with these disorders are too ill because of age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> co-morbidities to tolerate myeloablative chemotherapy followed by transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/64,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,72,73</a>]. Many of the observed long-term tumor responses have been brought about by immunologic antitumor effects (ie, the GVT effect) generated by the allograft (eg, donor lymphocyte infusion in CML relapsing after allogeneic HCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/54,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,74</a>]. </p><p>Importantly, not all diseases are equally susceptible to GVT effects. Follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia appear particularly responsive, whereas acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma are relatively resistant. The biological explanation for these observations remains elusive. As an example, in one analysis of 834 patients who had undergone allogeneic HCT, the overall relapse rate per patient year was 0.36. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma in remission, low grade or mantle cell lymphoma, and high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma had the lowest rates (0 to 0.24), whereas those with advanced myeloid and lymphoid malignancies had rates of more than 0.52 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Additional studies need to determine the relative role of this transplant approach, including such variables as the age and overall comorbidity status of the recipient, presence or absence of complete or partial remission at the time of HCT and clinical aggressiveness of the underlying disorder, the degree of HLA matching of the donor, and the agents and doses used in the reduced intensity conditioning regimens and GVHD prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/75-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-80</a>]. However, these approaches have been tolerated reasonably well even in patients who are elderly and have significant medical co-morbidities, allowing for many more patients to be treated with transplantation.

The purpose of the preparative regimen is twofold:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To provide adequate immunosuppression to prevent rejection of the transplanted graft</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>To treat the disease for which the transplant is being performed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparative regimens for HCT have been termed myeloablative, reduced intensity, and nonmyeloablative. While full agreement has not been achieved, generally accepted definitions of these three types are as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90901 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Myeloablative regimens</strong> &ndash; A myeloablative regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and produce profound pancytopenia. The resulting pancytopenia is long-lasting, likely irreversible, and in most instances fatal, unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. Examples include total body irradiation &ge;5 Gy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Myeloablative preparative regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Nonmyeloablative regimens</strong> &ndash; A nonmyeloablative regimen is one that will cause minimal cytopenia (but significant lymphopenia) by itself and does not require stem cell support. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> with or without antithymocyte globulin or total body irradiation &le;2 Gy with or without a purine analog. However, the transplant, when given in this setting usually results in full donor engraftment because the engrafting donor T cells will eventually eliminate host hematopoietic cells, allowing the establishment of donor hematopoiesis. (See <a href=\"#H89394696\" class=\"local\">'Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity preparative regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Reduced intensity regimens</strong> &ndash; Reduced intensity regimens are an intermediate category of regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Such regimens cause cytopenia, which may be prolonged and result in significant morbidity and mortality, and require stem cell support. Regimens generally considered as reduced intensity include &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, or &le;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are only a few randomized trials directly comparing the efficacy of one myeloablative preparative regimen with another. As a result, it is difficult to make direct statements about the suitability of a given preparative regimen in a particular disease setting. (See <a href=\"#H89394187\" class=\"local\">'Choice of preparative regimen'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the preparative regimens have short and long term side effects in addition to myelotoxicity. Other common toxicities include mucositis, nausea and vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea, rash, peripheral neuropathy, infertility, interstitial lung disease, and sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. Long-term complications following total body irradiation also include asymptomatic alterations in pulmonary function, cataracts, sicca syndrome, and thyroid dysfunction.
