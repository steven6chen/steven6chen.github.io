Patient selection is based on tumor characteristics as well as an assessment of the patients' prognosis and their ability and willingness to tolerate the anticipated toxicity of these regimens. Patients who recur within the high dose radiation area less than six months after the first course of radiation generally have radiation-resistant disease and are not usually considered candidates for a second course of radiation.</p><p>Tissues of the head and neck such as skin, nerves, blood vessels, and spinal cord normally receive maximally tolerated radiation doses during the initial course of radiation therapy (RT). Reirradiation exposes these tissues to further radiation and thereby incurs a risk of severe complications such as carotid artery stenosis or rupture, osteoradionecrosis, pharyngocutaneous fistulas, non-healing skin ulcers, and spinal cord damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radioresistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of a tumor recurrence in a previously irradiated field suggests the existence of a radioresistant clone that would limit the therapeutic effect of reirradiation. The initial disease-free interval plays an important role in the decision of whether or not to reirradiate. Patients with tumor recurrence within six months after the first course of radiation are generally thought to have radiation-resistant disease and therefore to be unlikely to benefit from a second course of radiation.</p><p>The problem of radioresistance may be particularly relevant to patients who develop local recurrence after initial treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Strategies to overcome radioresistance include the addition of radiation sensitizers, such as chemotherapy and targeted agents, and dose escalation or intensification, with techniques such as hyperfractionation, accelerated fractionation, conformal RT, and brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Ideally, a systemic agent different from that originally used for concurrent therapy should be employed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to overcome radiation resistance in head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough analysis of the initial treatment volumes and dose distributions relative to the location of the locoregional recurrence should be made when reirradiation is considered. Determination of the dose received at the site of recurrence may demonstrate geographic tumor miss and is necessary for treatment planning since a geographic or marginal miss may not represent the same radioresistant disease as a true in-field recurrence, even with a disease-free interval of less than a year.</p><p>Reirradiation treatment volumes are typically limited to a 1 to 2 cm margin around the gross tumor or the surgical site, with even smaller margins when tumors are near critical structures such as the spinal cord, optic nerve, or optic chiasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This approach was validated in a retrospective review of 66 reirradiated patients, which demonstrated that 96 percent of locoregional recurrences following reirradiation occurred within the gross tumor volume and only 4 percent occurred in untreated regional sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The lifetime spinal cord dose is usually limited to 50 Gy with the reirradiation dose to the spinal cord restricted to 10 percent of the prescribed reirradiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doses &ge;50 Gy to the tumor are necessary to yield substantial response rates and delay disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Many investigators and cooperative groups use 60 Gy as a target reirradiation dose, delivered through various reirradiation protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. Some large analyses demonstrate that patients treated to a higher radiation dose have improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therefore, we use an alternating-week schedule of 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily or 2 Gy once daily for five days followed by a nine-day break. However, there is no consensus regarding total dose or use of any particular dose fractionation scheme. For patients with gross disease, we typically prescribe 70 to 75 Gy, and for those treated following gross total resection, we prescribe 60 to 66 Gy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional conformal planning and advanced delivery techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and stereotactic body radiotherapy have been used to deliver high doses to tumors while minimizing the radiation dose to surrounding normal structures. Proton therapy may facilitate dose escalation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> normal tissue sparing, but data on its use for recurrent head and neck cancer are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Contemporary reports have demonstrated promising outcomes with the use of more conformal radiotherapy techniques such as IMRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Additionally, the use of fewer high doses of radiation therapy in selected patients (termed stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT]) has been investigated alone or in combination with chemotherapy and has also been associated with promising outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Investigations are ongoing to further evaluate the integration of newer radiation techniques for the use of reirradiation.

Some treat if the elective nodal areas are outside of the high dose area of previous irradiation or were not irradiated initially; others consider this to significantly increase the risk of side effects. However, we do not routinely treat elective nodal regions since the primary pattern of recurrence is in the reirradiated site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE REIRRADIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of postoperative reirradiation to surgical salvage may improve upon the results of using surgery alone. Retrospective reviews and phase <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> trials established the feasibility of postoperative reirradiation and suggested promising outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The Groupe d'Etude des Tumours Tete et Cou (GETTEC) in conjunction with Groupe d'Oncologie Radiotherapie Tete et Cou (GORTEC) conducted a prospective, randomized trial to confirm these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. After a macroscopic complete resection, 130 patients were randomized to reirradiation (60 Gy in 12 weeks) in combination with chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>) or no postoperative therapy. Postoperative reirradiation was associated with an improvement in progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) but not overall survival.</p><p>Subsequently, many have focused attention on those patients at highest risk of second failure after surgical salvage: those who have undergone macroscopic complete resections but were found to have high risk pathologic features, including positive margins, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, or extranodal extension. In nonrandomized trials, a three-year survival of 48 percent with postoperative reirradiation alone and a four-year overall survival of 43 percent with postoperative reirradiation with concurrent chemotherapy in these high-risk patients have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Patients without high risk features are generally not treated with postoperative reirradiation. However, we and others recommend the routine use of postoperative reirradiation for surgically resected patients with high-risk pathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/13,14,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,34</a>]. We suggest the use of the same concurrent chemotherapy protocols that are used for unresectable recurrences as discussed in the next section. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">REIRRADIATION FOR UNRESECTABLE RECURRENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although retrospective reviews and phase <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> studies have demonstrated that reirradiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy is feasible and that some patients may achieve long-term survival with reirradiation, it is not clear that reirradiation, with its accompanying toxicity, is superior to chemotherapy alone. </p><p>For appropriately selected patients, we suggest reirradiation with concurrent chemotherapy over chemotherapy or reirradiation alone. The data supporting this approach are derived from small, nonrandomized studies. Randomized trials designed to address this question were terminated because of poor accrual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Debulking surgery can theoretically provide immediate palliation of symptoms, remove radioresistant tumor, and allow for a reduced radiation dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> field size. Nevertheless, surgery may be disfiguring and can delay the start of reirradiation. Furthermore, some patients who undergo debulking surgery with a plan for subsequent chemotherapy and reirradiation never receive adjuvant therapy due to surgical complications.</p><p>Retrospective data suggest that, even in patients who have unresectable recurrences, surgical debulking prior to reirradiation increases the disease control <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/20,29,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,35</a>]. Although the improved outcome in these studies may have been attributable to a reduction in the tumor burden, it is also likely that selection bias was present. A prospective phase II study consisted of patients with recurrent or second primary head and neck cancer who were treated with two cycles of chemotherapy followed by local therapy (either surgery followed by chemotherapy and reirradiation or chemotherapy and reirradiation alone). Prior to the initial chemotherapy, surgeons declared if patients were surgical candidates. In the final analysis of this study, there was no difference in survival between those who underwent surgery and those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Surgical debulking can be offered to patients when it will result in an adequate enough resection to allow either sparing of normal tissues <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lower dose of prescribed radiation.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy, which uses anatomic references (ie, skull or spine), surgically placed fiducials, external markers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a rigid stereotactic frame to more accurately target radiation treatment, is emerging as an option for reirradiation of head and neck cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].
