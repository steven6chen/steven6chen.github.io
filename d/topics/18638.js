In contrast, OSs provide little retraction. They are tubular devices that fit inside the tracheal tube and convey an image using either a fiberoptic bundle or a video camera. </p><p>Optical indirect laryngoscopes use prisms, lenses, and mirrors rather than electronic components. The only available example of such a device is the Airtraq, which for the sake of simplicity we will consider a VL. </p><p>This topic will discuss the various types of VLs and OSs, the techniques used for endotracheal intubation with these devices in adults, and airway management outcomes with their use. Direct laryngoscopy, flexible scope intubation, use of supraglottic airways in anesthesia, and videolaryngoscopy in children, are discussed separately.

Other advantages include the option for other clinicians to simultaneously see what the operator sees, which creates opportunity for collaboration and teaching, and the fact that almost all of these devices enlarge the image. Some devices allow for recording, which is useful for clinical documentation, quality improvement, and teaching. They also create an opportunity for remote supervision by a more experienced airway manager, which may be beneficial in rural hospitals and during prehospital emergency airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Video laryngoscopy may reduce cervical spine motion, compared with direct laryngoscopy, especially when used with manual in line stabilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adults-with-acute-spinal-cord-injury#H1841459\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Choice of airway device'</a>.)</p><p>Laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope (VL) creates reduced lifting force on the base of the tongue, compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, and might theoretically attenuate the stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, studies have failed to show a reduction in the hemodynamic response to intubation with the use of rigid video laryngoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1753778712\"><span class=\"h1\">VIDEO LARYNGOSCOPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3098272578\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of video laryngoscopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video laryngoscopes (VLs) can be categorized according to the shape of the blade (Macintosh style versus acute-angle) and whether or not they have channels that accommodate and guide tracheal tube advancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Some VLs (eg, the C-MAC) are available with a Miller style blade, only in pediatric sizes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H18429782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscope'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3606903416\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-channelled VL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For endotracheal intubation with a VL without a channel, the device is used to obtain a view of the larynx, and the endotracheal tube is passed through the vocal cords independent of the device. Non-channelled VLs can be divided into those with conventionally curved blades similar to the Macintosh blade used for direct laryngoscopy (DL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72787 \">picture 1</a>), and those with acute-angle blades. A number of manufacturers of VLs make models with both types of blades (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111619%7EANEST%2F111620\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111619 graphicRef111620 \">picture 2A-B</a>). </p><p>The King Vision is available in a non-channeled or channelled version, both of which have a blade shaped to match the anatomic curve of the upper airway and more like an acute-angle blade than a conventional Macintosh-style blade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H766964123\"><span class=\"h4\">Macintosh-style VL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique for use of a Macintosh-style VL is similar to the use of the Macintosh blade for DL, and these devices can be used for both indirect and direct laryngoscopy. Therefore, they are useful for teaching and supervising DL, since the instructor can see on the monitor the same view the trainee sees while performing DL. Examples of VLs with Macintosh-style blades include the C-MAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111564\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111564 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111619\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111619 \">picture 2A</a>), the Glidescope Mac-T, and the McGrath MAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111567\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111567 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H764742635\"><span class=\"h4\">Acute-angle blade VLs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute-angle VL blade allows better visualization of anterior laryngeal structures than a more gently curved blade. These devices cannot usually be used for DL. Examples of devices with acute-angle blades include several of the Glidescope products (LoPro Titanium, AVL, and Ranger), C-MAC D-blade, and the McGrath EDL-X blade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111565\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111565 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111570 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111568\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111568 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111569 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111618\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111618 \">picture 9</a>). The Glidescope blade is oriented upward at a 60 degree angle, with the recessed wide-angle CMOS camera, located a third of the way from the distal tip of the blade.</p><p>A stylet or tracheal introducer should be used to guide the tip of the endotracheal tube into the glottis when using acute-angle VLs. The use of these blades without an introducer is contrary to the manufacturers' recommendations and may require repeated attempts at laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A specialized rigid stylet is available for the Glidescope, with a 70 degree bend angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111571\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111571 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1900009287\"><span class=\"h3\">Channelled VL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Channelled VLs are shaped to match the anatomic curve of the upper airway. All are designed to be positioned around the base of the tongue, providing laryngeal exposure with reduced cervical manipulation or tongue displacement. They do not allow for independent manipulation of the tracheal tube; rather, the tube is directed by manipulating the laryngoscope itself. Channelled VLs are bulkier than those without channels since they must accommodate an endotracheal tube adjacent to the optical and light-emitting diode (LED) elements. Therefore, these devices may not be appropriate for patients with severely limited mouth opening. </p><p>The most widely used channelled VLs are the Airtraq Avant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111563\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111563 \">picture 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111591\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111591 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111670\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111670 \">picture 13</a>), Airway Scope (Pentax) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85754 \">picture 14</a>), and King Vision (Ambu) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111572\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111572 \">picture 15</a>). All of these laryngoscopes are entirely disposable or have single-use components. The channelled VLs are all similar in shape and concept but differ with respect to the range of available sizes, and the type and quality of display. The King Vision VL can be used with channelled or non-channelled blades. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37014118\"><span class=\"h3\">Other distinguishing features of VLs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of features differ among the many available video laryngoscopes, and these features change with advances in technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sizes available (eg, pediatric and adult) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H18429782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscope'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blade thickness, which is particularly important in patients with small mouth opening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability of reusable and single use versions </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resolution of the video camera or display</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor size, lighting, resolution, portability, input and output options &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to save images and videos (eg, with SD card or USB drive)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portability </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost per use</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4089324158\"><span class=\"h2\">Video laryngoscopy technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When using all types of VLs, <strong>the operator should be looking in the patient&rsquo;s mouth, not at the video screen, when inserting the laryngoscope and the endotracheal tube into the oropharynx,</strong> to avoid injury of the teeth and soft tissue.

With either technique, a jaw thrust should be used to elevate the epiglottis, reveal the vocal cords, and facilitate advancement of the OS and endotracheal tube (ETT) between the vocal cords. (See <a href=\"#H1426300754\" class=\"local\">'Optical stylet technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited studies have reported a wide range of intubation success rates with the use of OSs. Success rates appear to be high with experienced users, including in patients with predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H3437227146\" class=\"local\">'Intubation success with optical stylets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reported complications with the use of VLs include injuries of teeth, soft tissues of the pharynx and hypopharynx, vocal cords, and trachea. Many injuries may be avoided by directly watching the insertion and advancement of the laryngoscope and endotracheal tube (rather than watching the monitor) until the tip is beyond the soft palate or camera. (See <a href=\"#H2456977187\" class=\"local\">'Complications of VL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sakles JC, Mosier J, Hadeed G, et al.
