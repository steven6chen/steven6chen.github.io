The work group recommended that the traditional term &quot;renal osteodystrophy&quot; be exclusively used to define alterations in bone morphology associated with CKD and stated that definitive diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy can only be made by bone biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Following the introduction of the term CKD-MBD, various clinical practice guidelines have recommended laboratory targets and therapeutic approaches aimed at ameliorating the consequences of this systemic disorder.</p><p>This topic reviews the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD. The treatment of hyperphosphatemia and of secondary hyperparathyroidism in nondialysis CKD patients and in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is discussed elsewhere.

The main goal of this system is maintenance of calcium and phosphorus balance, often at the expense of abnormalities in other components of the system.</p><p>While most elements of CKD&ndash;MBD are usually present when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> some components may be observed earlier in the course of CKD and precede the onset of clinically detectable abnormalities in serum phosphorus, calcium, PTH, and vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. These include decreased bone formation rates, vascular calcification, loss of klotho, and increased FGF23 secretion.</p><p>With progressive loss of functioning nephrons, phosphate excretion is maintained by reducing the tubular reabsorption of filtered phosphate in the remaining nephrons, an effect mediated by FGF23 and PTH. Bone disease develops as early as CKD stage 2 (ie, estimated GFR [eGFR] 60 to 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and becomes almost universal in patients with CKD stage 5 (eGFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. Vascular calcifications also develop early, and their prevalence increases as the GFR declines such that approximately 80 percent of incident dialysis patients have evidence of coronary artery calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H218489321\"><span class=\"h1\">ABNORMALITIES OF PARATHYROID HORMONE, CALCIUM, PHOSPHORUS, FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 23, AND VITAMIN D METABOLISM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a major feature of CKD-MBD. Secondary hyperparathyroidism begins early in the course of CKD, and its prevalence increases as kidney function declines (particularly to estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs in response to a series of abnormalities that initiate and maintain increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The main abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phosphate retention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased free ionized calcium concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reduced expression of vitamin D receptors (VDRs), calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs), fibroblast growth factor receptors, and klotho in the parathyroid glands</p><p/><p>The relative importance of these abnormalities in triggering PTH production can be understood by examining the changes in their concentrations in relation to the increase in PTH during the course of CKD. Increased PTH concentrations first become evident when the eGFR drops below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. At that time, serum calcium and phosphate concentrations are normal and remain within normal ranges until the eGFR decreases to approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Circulating calcitriol concentrations begin to fall much earlier, when the GFR is &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (occasionally even at higher eGFRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]), and are typically markedly reduced in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The primary reason for the decline in calcitriol concentration is likely an increase in FGF23 concentration, rather than the loss of functioning renal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Hyperphosphatemia (a relatively late phenomenon in CKD) may also contribute to the decline in calcitriol synthesis by suppression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme.</p><p>Thus, progressive kidney dysfunction results in calcitriol deficiency and hyperphosphatemia, both of which result in hypocalcemia. These abnormalities directly increase PTH concentrations via different mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Phosphate retention and hyperphosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphate retention has long been thought to be the initial trigger for many of the components of CKD-MBD, particularly the increased PTH secretion. A tendency to phosphate retention, beginning early in CKD as the decline in GFR decreases the filtered phosphate load, is thought to play a central role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Three major and not mutually exclusive theories have been proposed to explain how phosphate retention initially promotes PTH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The induction of hypocalcemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased formation or activity of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D that is produced by the kidney)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased PTH gene expression</p><p/><p>Phosphate retention contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism in early CKD at least in part by decreasing serum free calcium concentration and calcitriol synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. If phosphate retention is prevented by restricting phosphate intake in proportion to the reduction in GFR, the rise in plasma PTH concentration can be prevented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Even in patients who have moderate renal insufficiency and already established secondary hyperparathyroidism, lowering the plasma phosphate concentration with oral phosphate binders can partially reverse the hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and calcitriol deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, serum phosphate levels are not elevated in the majority of patients in the early stages of CKD, probably due to a reduction in renal tubular phosphate resorption mediated by increased levels of PTH and FGF23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The effects of FGF23 on phosphate excretion may become blunted by klotho deficiency, which occurs early in CKD. At this point, PTH may become the primary factor in maintaining serum phosphate level.</p><p>From the viewpoint of phosphate homeostasis, the initial elevation in PTH secretion is appropriate since the ensuing increase in phosphate excretion lowers the plasma phosphate concentration toward normal. Among patients with severely reduced GFR, PTH inhibits proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption from the normal 80 to 95 percent to as low as 15 percent of the filtered phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/12,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26</a>]. Hyperparathyroidism also tends to correct both the hypocalcemia (by increasing bone resorption) and the calcitriol deficiency (by stimulating the 1-hydroxylation of calcidiol [25-hydroxyvitamin D] in the proximal tubule). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Despite this seemingly beneficial adaptive increase in PTH secretion, hyperparathyroidism becomes maladaptive over the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, the effect of PTH on phosphate balance changes as GFR declines. In advanced stages of CKD, when the GFR drops below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> the compensatory increase in the levels of PTH and FGF23 becomes inadequate, and hyperphosphatemia develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>]. Moreover, since phosphate reabsorption by the renal tubules cannot be lowered below a minimum threshold, continued PTH-induced release of phosphate from bone can actually exacerbate the hyperphosphatemia.</p><p>Hyperphosphatemia may also have a direct effect on PTH synthesis and secretion that is independent of the plasma concentrations of calcium and calcitriol in advanced CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. A study in experimental animals with ESRD demonstrated that dietary phosphate restriction to normalize the plasma phosphate concentration lowered plasma PTH concentrations from 130 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This occurred without changes in the plasma calcium or calcitriol concentrations. Parathyroid size also decreased in these animals, suggesting that hyperphosphatemia stimulates parathyroid growth in renal failure. This effect is apparently through the reduction of PTH messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations via increasing posttranscriptional PTH mRNA message stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>These observations appear to be applicable to humans, as illustrated by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report evaluated the effect of adding phosphate to the dialysate of patients on maintenance hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Phosphate was added to the dialysate to raise the plasma phosphate concentration by 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> above the baseline of 4.7 to 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.5 to 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. At 12 weeks, 7 of 15 patients showed significant elevations in plasma PTH concentrations without changes in the plasma concentrations of ionized calcium or calcitriol (the latter was low initially and remained low throughout the study).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study showed that in vitro exposure of hyperplastic parathyroid tissue obtained from patients with renal failure to high phosphate concentrations increased preproPTH mRNA and enhanced PTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>Hyperphosphatemia also stimulates the secretion of FGF23, which acts to suppress PTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fibroblast growth factor 23'</a> below.)</p><p>Perhaps the most important consequence of hyperphosphatemia is on the cardiovascular system since hyperphosphatemia stimulates osteoblastic transformation of the vascular smooth muscle cell in the vasculature and directly contributes to cardiovascular calcification and arterial stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased calcitriol activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma calcitriol concentrations generally fall below normal when the GFR is &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, although low concentrations have also been found in some patients with higher eGFR (ie, &lt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/13,21,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,37-39</a>].</p><p>Initially, the decline in calcitriol concentration is likely to be due to the increase in FGF23 concentration rather than the loss of functioning renal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The FGF23-induced decrease in calcitriol begins early, when the GFR drops to &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. However, in advanced CKD, hyperphosphatemia and loss of renal mass in addition to increased FGF23 levels contribute to the decline in calcitriol synthesis.</p><p>Phosphate retention (or perhaps increased phosphate concentrations in the proximal tubule) can directly suppress the renal synthesis of calcitriol by inhibiting 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. FGF23 decreases the synthesis of calcitriol by suppressing the activity of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to calcitriol, and by stimulating the 24-hydroxylase enzyme, which converts calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) to inactive metabolites in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/15,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,40,41</a>]. Increased dietary phosphate load and increased calcitriol stimulate the secretion of FGF23, predominantly by bone osteocytes, which act on target tissues by binding to and activating the FGF23 receptor in the presence of its co-receptor, klotho [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Concentrations of FGF23 increase soon after renal injury and progressively increase as kidney function worsens, possibly as a physiologic adaptation to maintain normal serum phosphate by enhancing excretion in the urine. Thus, the increase of FGF23, while important for maintaining phosphate balance in early CKD, results in a &quot;trade-off&quot; of reduced calcitriol concentrations, which may act as the initial trigger for increased PTH production. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fibroblast growth factor 23'</a> below.)</p><p>Low calcitriol concentrations increase PTH secretion by indirect and direct mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Indirect effects on PTH are achieved through decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and calcium release from bone, both of which promote the development of hypocalcemia, which stimulates PTH secretion.</p><p>Calcitriol normally acts on the VDR in the parathyroid gland to suppress PTH transcription but not PTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A decrease in calcitriol concentrations also lowers the number of VDRs in the parathyroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The lack of calcitriol and the decreased number of receptors may both promote parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia and nodule formation through potential nongenomic effects.</p><p>Even normal plasma calcitriol concentrations do not necessarily preclude a role for initial calcitriol deficiency, since the ensuing secondary hyperparathyroidism will increase calcitriol synthesis. However, not all PTH fragments stimulate the 1-alpha-hydroxylase and increase calcitriol synthesis. In an animal model, the PTH fragment (1-34) increased calcitriol concentrations, whereas PTH (1-84) did not. Moreover, infusion of carboxyl (C)-terminal PTH fragments actually reduced the synthesis of calcitriol by a posttranscriptional mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>More importantly, low calcitriol concentration can increase PTH secretion by removing the inhibitory effect of calcitriol on the parathyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/21,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,49</a>]. The administration of calcitriol, on the other hand, can partially reverse the hyperparathyroidism both in early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Calcitriol and other vitamin D analogs can reduce parathyroid cell proliferation in vitro, in part by blocking the increase in the growth-promoting factor transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>There is also evidence that decreased responsiveness to calcitriol contributes to the development of hyperparathyroidism. In particular, physiologic concentrations of calcitriol may be unable to normally suppress PTH secretion, perhaps due to a reduction in the number of VDRs in the parathyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/47,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,52</a>]. In experimental models, this change can be demonstrated relatively early in the course of renal failure (ie, when the plasma creatinine concentration has only doubled) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Low calcitriol concentrations appear to play an important role in the decline in VDRs since the defect can be largely corrected by calcitriol supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. At a later stage, retained uremic toxins may also contribute by decreasing both receptor synthesis and the ability of the active hormone-receptor complex to bind to vitamin D response elements in the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/43,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,53</a>].</p><p>Studies in patients on maintenance dialysis reveal that the decrease in receptor density is most prominent in areas of nodular, rather than diffuse, hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Thus, a reduced number of VDRs may contribute both to the progression of hyperparathyroidism and to the proliferation of parathyroid cells, leading to nodule formation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Tertiary hyperparathyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders of calcium balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have suggested that disorders of calcium balance due to CKD-MBD may play a role in the high cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD. Both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia are associated with increased mortality in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Hypocalcemia is common among CKD patients and may be associated with increased PTH secretion and abnormal bone remodeling.</p><p>On the other hand, hypercalcemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of extraskeletal calcification. Moreover, positive calcium balance may also be an important factor in progression of calcification. An animal model of CKD showed that calcium added to the drinking water led to increased thoracic aorta, heart, and aortic valve calcification regardless of the serum calcium level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Calcium is a major regulator of PTH secretion. Minute changes in the serum ionized calcium are sensed by a specific membrane receptor, the CaSR, which is highly expressed on the surface of the chief cells of the parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Decreased expression of the CaSR appears to be related to the proliferation of parathyroid tissue, and both may be related to increased phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/61,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,63</a>]. The change in receptor number can lead to inadequate suppression of PTH secretion by calcium, resulting in inappropriately high PTH concentrations in the setting of normal or even high calcium concentrations.

FGF23 is secreted by bone osteocytes and osteoblasts in response to calcitriol, increased dietary phosphate load, PTH, and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/68-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-73</a>]. Among CKD patients, increased FGF23 concentrations may also be due to decreased clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/15,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,72,73</a>]. An animal model suggested that the kidney itself plays a key role in FGF23 metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In this study, the half-life of exogenous recombinant human FGF23 was significantly prolonged in anephric rats. Moreover, measurements of plasma FGF23 in the renal artery and renal vein of rats demonstrated a significant renal extraction of FGF23.</p><p>FGF23's primary function is to maintain normal serum phosphate concentration by reducing renal phosphate reabsorption and by reducing intestinal phosphate absorption through decreased calcitriol production. In renal proximal tubular cells, FGF23 binds to the FGF receptor (FGFR) and its coreceptor, klotho, causing downregulation of the luminal membrane <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> cotransporter <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/Pi</span> IIa (and possibly also the <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/Pi</span> IIc transporter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Decreased cotransporters in the proximal tubule lead to reduced phosphate reabsorption from urine and increased urinary phosphate excretion. FGF23 also inhibits the proximal tubular expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme, leading to decreased calcitriol synthesis by the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Therefore, FGF23 directly increases urinary excretion of phosphate and indirectly suppresses intestinal phosphate absorption by downregulating the production of calcitriol. The net effect of both hormonal actions is to lower serum phosphate concentration.</p><p>Increased FGF23 levels may be one of the earliest detectable biomarkers of CKD-MBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In patients with CKD, FGF23 levels increase prior to changes in the serum calcium, phosphorus, or PTH levels. Treatments used to control CKD-MBD, such as vitamin D analogs and calcium-based phosphate binders, stimulate FGF23 production.</p><p>However, among individuals with eGFR in a normal range, the PTH may increase before FGF23, when the eGFR decreases modestly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Moreover, the study found that plasma FGF23 is associated with reduced plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and reduced renal calcium excretion but not with increased renal phosphate excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. These data suggest that the role of FGF23 as a 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 counterregulatory hormone may be more important than its role as a phosphaturic hormone, at least when the renal function is normal.</p><p>Another study found that, in patients with CKD and vitamin D deficiency, PTH levels were markedly elevated relative to those of FGF23, suggesting that FGF23 may have a lower phosphaturic role when PTH secretion is stimulated in response to vitamin D deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>FGF23 also suppresses PTH secretion by the parathyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, among CKD patients, the presence of high PTH concentrations, despite high FGF23 concentrations, suggests that the parathyroid gland becomes relatively resistant to the elevated concentrations of FGF23. This may be related to the markedly decreased expression of FGFR 1 and klotho protein in the hyperplastic parathyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>Klotho, a transmembrane protein produced by osteocytes, is required for FGF23 receptor activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The klotho extracellular domain does not directly bind to FGF23 but enhances FGF23 binding to its receptor complex with a much higher affinity than to the FGFR alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Klotho expression declines early in the course of CKD and then progressively with decreasing GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. The reduction in klotho temporally coincides with the rise in FGF23, suggesting that this decline may be partially responsible for the progressive rise in FGF23 concentration. Moreover, the decrease in klotho expression on hyperplastic parathyroid glands may contribute to the resistance and impaired parathyroid suppression by FGF23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/3,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,83</a>].

These effects could conceivably lead to renal sodium retention, volume overload, hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, FGF23 does not seem to promote cardiovascular calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal resistance to PTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal resistance to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) appears to contribute to the genesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Finally, the potential antagonistic actions of PTH fragment PTH-(7-84) to those of PTH-(1-84) may contribute to the higher PTH concentrations in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Tertiary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with ESRD develop markedly elevated PTH concentrations, often associated with hypercalcemia that cannot be explained by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> or calcitriol supplements. Such patients often fail medical therapy and ultimately require parathyroidectomy. This entity, called tertiary hyperparathyroidism, in part reflects severe parathyroid hyperplasia, with autonomous secretion of PTH that is no longer adequately responsive to the plasma calcium concentration. Autonomous function of parathyroid tissue results from the increase in parathyroid gland mass rather than an alteration in the set point of PTH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

The state of prolonged stimulation of parathyroid cell growth in CKD patients due to high phosphate, low calcitriol, and hypocalcemia results in nodular hyperplasia. Nodular parathyroid glands do not undergo involution, despite resolution of some of the triggering mechanisms. This is best illustrated by the high PTH concentrations and hypercalcemia that may persist in CKD patients after receiving renal transplant.</p><p>Another important pathogenetic factor in many cases of tertiary hyperparathyroidism is neoplastic transformation, leading to overgrowth by a monoclonal parathyroid adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].

The gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of bone disease in CKD is bone biopsy. However, because bone biopsy is invasive and costly, several bone biomarkers have been used for the diagnosis and monitoring of bone turnover. Unfortunately, all have limitations in the assessment of renal bone disease.</p><p>Bone turnover can be viewed as the ratio between bone formation and bone resorption and thus is a function of the degree of hyperparathyroidism. Although parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be a better indicator of parathyroid gland activity rather than of bone turnover, PTH level has traditionally been used as a marker of bone turnover.</p><p>However, PTH levels within the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI)- or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)-recommended therapeutic targets are not consistently helpful in predicting the nature of the underlying bone turnover. One study suggested that combination of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) with PTH may improve the diagnostic ability of either marker alone in predicting the type of bone disease in CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. However, a more recent study showed that this combination only marginally improved the ability to discriminate high from low bone turnover, suggesting that, despite its limitations, PTH level remains a reasonable marker of bone turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>KDIGO recommends that three parameters be used to assess bone pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These parameters include bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV system). Any combination of parameters may be used to describe a given sample. The TMV system of classification of renal osteodystrophy serves to emphasize the contributions of mineralization and volume, as well as turnover, to bone quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>TMV characteristics of the major CKD-related bone diseases are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteitis fibrosa cystica</strong> &ndash; Osteitis fibrosa cystica is characterized by high bone turnover due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adynamic bone disease</strong> &ndash; Adynamic bone disease is characterized by low bone turnover.

In osteomalacia, the mineralization lag time is prolonged to &gt;100 days in comparison with &lt;35 days in normal subjects and those with pure osteitis fibrosa. Osteomalacia, which is now uncommon, was due primarily to aluminum deposition in bone at a time when aluminum-containing antacids were used as phosphate binders. The incidence of osteomalacia has decreased with the abandonment of aluminum-based phosphate binders and the introduction of more efficient techniques for treatment of water used in preparing the dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/101-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-104</a>].

However, subclinical changes in bone remodeling begin early in the course of CKD.

Such disorders are collectively termed chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). The term &quot;renal osteodystrophy&quot; is exclusively used to define bone pathology observed on biopsy. CKD-MBD is characterized by the following (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definitions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or vitamin D metabolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume linear growth, or strength <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extraskeletal calcification</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hyperparathyroidism encompasses most of the biochemical abnormalities that characterize CKD-MBD. Causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include phosphate retention; decreased free calcium concentration; decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) concentration; and the reduced expression of vitamin D receptors (VDRs), calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and klotho in the parathyroid glands. (See <a href=\"#H218489321\" class=\"local\">'Abnormalities of parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, fibroblast growth factor 23, and vitamin D metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three parameters are used to assess bone pathology (ie, renal osteodystrophy): bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV system). Any combination of parameters may be used to describe a given sample. The TMV system of classification of renal osteodystrophy emphasizes the contribution of mineralization and volume, as well as turnover rate, to bone quality. TMV characteristics of the major CKD-related bone diseases are as follows (see <a href=\"#H312947\" class=\"local\">'Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume linear growth, or strength'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Osteitis fibrosa cystica is characterized predominantly by high turnover due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adynamic bone disease is characterized predominantly by low turnover. Most cases result from excessive suppression of the parathyroid glands. This is the most common CKD-related bone lesion among dialysis patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Osteomalacia is characterized by low bone turnover in combination with abnormal mineralization. Osteomalacia is uncommon since the decline in use of aluminum-containing phosphate binders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mixed uremic osteodystrophy is characterized by either high- or low-bone turnover and by abnormal mineralization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with any of the lesions defined above are at greater risk of bone fractures than the general population because of changes in bone quality. However, despite progressive lesions, symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs due to the various bone disorders, such as fractures and bone pain, generally do not occur until the patient is already on maintenance dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H312947\" class=\"local\">'Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume linear growth, or strength'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular or other soft-tissue calcification is caused by calcium phosphate precipitation due to persistent hyperparathyroidism and associated with increased mortality.
