As a result, there are now more than 15 million cancer survivors in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and close to 30 million worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and this number is expected to increase over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Given the growing population of patients once treated (or continuing treatment) for cancer, the medical community must learn how to best minimize the complications of cancer treatment. &#160;</p><p>A growing population of adult survivors of both pediatric and adult-onset cancers are recognized to have an increased incidence of: 1) cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity), 2) cardiovascular disease (coronary disease, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and 3) pulmonary disease compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Epidemiologic data suggest that common cardiovascular risk factors are more strongly associated with risk of incident cardiovascular disease in cancer survivors as compared with noncancer controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because of the potential for these conditions to result in a high degree of morbidity and mortality, understanding how to improve the prevention, recognition, and treatment of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease is an important priority to the overall health of this population.</p><p>This section will focus on the long-term cardiovascular complications encountered in cancer survivorship, and will also cover respiratory issues related to cancer therapy. Since there are a myriad of possible complications of cancer therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], this section will summarize the most important and common cardiopulmonary conditions related to these systems. In each subsection, the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis will be highlighted, if known, and areas where improvements in understanding are needed will be outlined. Finally, practical recommendations will be made for certain principles that may help guide the optimal treatment of cardiovascular effects in cancer survivors.</p><p>For readers who desire a broader overview of cancer survivorship, a separate topic that discusses these issues is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21065932\"><span class=\"h1\">ATHEROSCLEROSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21065940\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary to RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is well-established that radiation therapy (RT) is associated with an increased risk of coronary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] and carotid artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. This is believed to be secondary to damage to the microvasculature, which results in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and accelerated atherosclerosis. </p><p>The risk from RT has likely been best characterized in patients with breast cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Data from breast cancer participants treated from 2005 to 2008 suggested that the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events was 3.3 percent over a median follow-up time of 7.6 years (range, 0.1 to 10.1 years). Each Gray of radiation delivered to the heart was associated with a 16.5 percent increased risk of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The adverse cardiovascular effects of RT are also becoming increasingly recognized in other malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer where higher heart radiation doses have been associated with worse overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Moreover, any vascular location that is in the radiation field is at increased risk for early atherosclerosis. This is particularly relevant among patients with head and neck cancer because neck RT is a major risk factor for significant carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], and the complexity of atherosclerosis can be quite challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Further discussion on the cardiotoxicity associated with RT is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Frequently, there are no symptoms attributable to either coronary artery disease (CAD) or carotid disease in patients previously treated with RT. Therefore, clinicians should be proactive about age-appropriate cardiovascular screening for potentially significant yet asymptomatic disease in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Noninvasive cardiac stress testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive coronary angiography are commonly used diagnostic testing modalities to evaluate for CAD. For patients at risk for carotid artery disease, ultrasound is the safest and most effective screening tool. Other modalities may also be recommended depending upon patient characteristics and institutional expertise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beyond screening, aggressive management of known cardiac risk factors is the best prevention for atherosclerosis in a cancer survivor.

Of these, the pulmonary complications associated with bleomycin (an agent commonly used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer) have been best characterized. </p><p>While this drug can cause a variety of insults, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a> interstitial pneumonitis (BIP) is the most common. Depending on the definition used, BIP has been reported to occur in up to 46 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. BIP is of particular relevance to the long-term care of cancer survivors, given its potential progression to pulmonary fibrosis and associated increased mortality. For example, a study of 38,907 survivors of testicular cancer treated with bleomycin in the past revealed an increased standardized mortality ratio of 2.53 (95% CI 1.26-4.53) for respiratory diseases alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

The incidence and extent of radiation damage depends on the volume of lung irradiated, total radiation dose, and radiation fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

Steroids can be helpful and patients can have complete resolution of symptoms after six to eight weeks of treatment. Like BIP, however, radiation pneumonitis can progress to fibrosis, making this particularly relevant to the care of long-term survivors.

Using these criteria for BOS, a single center study of 1145 patients revealed a prevalence of 5.5 percent in transplanted patients and 14 percent in patients with chronic GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. However, International Bone Marrow Transplant registry data on 6275 adult patients with leukemia treated with allogenic HSCT reported an incidence of only 1.7 percent using prior diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>In its early stages, patients are rarely symptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms of mild dyspnea on exertion or non-productive cough. However, as the disease progresses, patients suffer from significant dyspnea on exertion, persistent nonproductive cough, and decreased exercise tolerance. If BOS worsens, patients eventually develop significant hypoxia and become oxygen dependent, and alongside this an increased risk for pulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-survivorship-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-issues/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].
