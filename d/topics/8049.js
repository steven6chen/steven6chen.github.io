They most often form on the skin and are usually pink or red, or skin-colored with blotches of pink or red (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87009 \">picture 1</a>). These mounds are sometimes referred to as tumors, but they are <strong>not</strong> caused by cancer, and they are usually harmless.</p><p>Hemangiomas are most common in children. They are not usually visible at birth. Instead, they usually show up during the first few days or months of life. They can appear on any part of the body, but they are most common on the head or face. When they first show up, they can grow very quickly. Later on, they usually shrink and eventually disappear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997843\"><span class=\"h1\">Are hemangiomas painful or uncomfortable?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. Hemangiomas can look scary, but they don't usually cause any harm. In rare cases, though, they can form sores, bleed, or get infected. When hemangiomas form inside the body, they can cause serious problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997858\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if your child develops a new mound somewhere on his or her body, see a doctor or nurse. The doctor or nurse can figure out what's wrong and if any treatment is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997873\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hemangiomas treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most hemangiomas do not need to be treated. In some cases, doctors will treat a hemangioma if it:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is very large or located in a part of the body where it can cause health problems, such as near the eye or liver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Could cause permanent harm to the child's appearance </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets sore, starts bleeding, or gets infected</p><p/><p>When treatment is needed, doctors can prescribe a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">propranolol</a> to shrink hemangiomas or to keep them from growing. They don't prescribe this medicine in all cases because most hemangiomas go away without treatment.</p><p>In some cases, doctors recommend surgery to remove a hemangioma, or laser treatment to make it less visible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997888\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important thing you can do is to help your child feel normal. Having a hemangioma can be hard for a child. Other people (especially other children) might stare or draw attention to your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997903\"><span class=\"h1\">When will my child's hemangioma go away?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That is hard to predict but here are some numbers that should help:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>50 percent of hemangiomas have gone away by the time a child turns 5</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>70 percent have gone away by the time a child turns 7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>90 percent have gone away by the time a child turns 9</p><p/><p>Keep in mind that your child's skin might not look completely normal even after the hemangioma shrinks. Still, it makes sense to wait and see what happens to your child's skin before starting treatments that might not be necessary.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
