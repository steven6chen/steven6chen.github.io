Less commonly, lung isolation may be necessary to prevent soiling of the contralateral lung when unilateral massive pulmonary hemorrhage or abscess is present, or to avoid ventilation of a unilateral bronchopleural fistula, lung cyst, or bullae.</p><p>This topic will discuss specific devices used for lung isolation (eg, double-lumen endotracheal tubes or bronchial blockers) and selection of the most appropriate device for various clinical situations. </p><p>The indications, physiology, ventilation strategies, management of hypoxemia, and complications of OLV are reviewed separately.

Details regarding positioning are noted below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"#H490611923\" class=\"local\">'Positioning left double-lumen tubes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"#H1851140320\" class=\"local\">'Positioning right double-lumen tubes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"#H2112008035\" class=\"local\">'Positioning bronchial blockers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A working knowledge of tracheobronchial anatomy is essential for successful lung isolation. In one trial, 39 percent of anesthesiologists with limited thoracic experience were unable to successfully achieve lung separation due to unfamiliarity with the endoscopic view of the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This failure rate was independent of which device was selected.</p><p>A review of airway anatomy is available online at <a href=\"http://www.thoracic-anesthesia.com/&amp;token=qarzLAn4JdAbZ323FG1scEEYceH3YtwMU95zLry7nMhj/Gt9apHmoGQPvIqvUBF7&amp;TOPIC_ID=14944\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.thoracic-anesthesia.com</a> and is summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trachea</strong> &ndash; The trachea arises from the cricoid cartilage and extends caudally in the midline to the tracheal carina. Anterolaterally, the trachea is composed of 18 to 22 C-shaped cartilaginous rings. The ends of each &quot;C&quot; ring are linked posteriorly by the superficial membranous wall and the trachealis muscle, resulting in the normal ovoid appearance of the adult trachea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The length of the adult trachea averages 12 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The average tracheal diameter is 22 mm in men and 19 mm in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87187 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion of the airway in adults with an average diameter of 17 mm in men and 13 mm in women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carina</strong> &ndash; At the carina, the trachea bifurcates into the right and left mainstem bronchi. Viewed endoscopically from the trachea, the carina can be identified by a sharp bifurcation in the 12 to 6 o'clock position and the symmetrical large calibers of the right and left mainstem bronchi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87188 \">picture 1</a>). The subsequent second-generation bifurcations within each mainstem bronchus (leading to the lobes) are generally not visible. Relative to the trachea, the takeoff of the right mainstem bronchus is in a more vertical plane (at a 20 to 30 degree angle), while the takeoff of the left mainstem bronchus is in a more horizontal plane (at a 40 to 50 degree angle).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Right mainstem bronchus </strong>&ndash; The right mainstem bronchus is very short compared with the left mainstem bronchus (approximately 1.9 cm long in men and 1.5 cm long in women). As a result, positioning a right-sided DLT can be challenging (see <a href=\"#H1851140320\" class=\"local\">'Positioning right double-lumen tubes'</a> below). The right mainstem bronchus gives rise to the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus at the 3 to 4 o'clock position and the bronchus intermedius (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87189\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87189 \">picture 2</a>). The trifurcation of the RUL bronchus into apical, anterior, and posterior segments results in a distinct endoscopic triangle formation, which can be useful in differentiating the right from the left bronchial tree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87192 \">picture 3</a>). The bronchus intermedius leads to the right middle lobe (RML) bronchus and the right lower lobe (RLL) bronchus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87211\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87211 \">picture 4</a>). In contrast to all other bifurcations, which lead to equally sized bronchi, the ratio of the RML bronchus to the RLL bronchus is approximately 2:3. The longitudinal muscle bundles form the posterior wall of the trachea and continue into both the right and left mainstem bronchi, then into the lower lobes of each lung. Following the path of these longitudinal bundles aids in distinguishing the RLL bronchus from the RML bronchus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Left mainstem bronchus</strong> &ndash; The left mainstem bronchus is long compared with the right mainstem bronchus (approximately 4.9 cm in men and 4.4 cm in women) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87212 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For this reason, maintaining ideal position of a lung isolation device is generally easier on the left than on the right side. (See <a href=\"#H490611923\" class=\"local\">'Positioning left double-lumen tubes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The left mainstem bronchus bifurcates equally into a left upper lobe (LUL) bronchus and left lower lobe (LLL) bronchus, and may be mistaken for the tracheal carina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87213\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87213 \">picture 6</a>). However, in contrast to the tracheal carina, the <span class=\"nowrap\">LUL/LLL</span> carina is less sharp and leads to smaller-caliber openings, each with visible bifurcations. Like the RLL bronchus, the longitudinal muscle bundles continue into the LLL bronchus, allowing it to be easily distinguished from the LUL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46437256\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF LUNG ISOLATION DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three types of lung isolation devices are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left or right double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchial blocker placement via a single-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placement of a single-lumen ETT into a mainstem bronchus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46437270\"><span class=\"h2\">Double-lumen endobronchial tubes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3404936359\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of double-lumen tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A DLT permits isolation, selective ventilation, and intermittent suctioning of either lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. A DLT has separate tracheal and bronchial lumens; essentially, it is two tubes connected side by side. The shorter tube has a high-volume, low-pressure tracheal cuff and gives rise to the tracheal lumen which is positioned just above the carina. With both left and right DLTs, the smaller low-volume, high-pressure bronchial cuff is ideally positioned just below the tracheal carina but before the takeoff of any lobar bronchi. DLTs are labelled either left- or right-sided depending on which mainstem bronchus the longer tube is designed to fit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88676 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88677\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88677 \">figure 3</a>). The cuffs, their pilot balloons, and the connection site at the top of each of the two tubes are all color-coded (white for the tracheal tube and blue for the endobronchial tube).</p><p>Once the DLT is properly seated, both the tracheal and bronchial cuffs are inflated. To achieve selective one lung ventilation (OLV), the <span class=\"nowrap\">tube/lumen</span> for the contralateral lung is clamped. For example, with left-sided DLTs, the bronchial (blue) lumen provides ventilation to the left lung while the tracheal (white) lumen ventilates the right. To selectively ventilate the right lung, flow to the left lung is stopped by clamping the bronchial (blue) lumen proximal to the bronchoscopy port. Conversely, to ventilate the left lung, the tracheal (white) lumen would need to be clamped. Once clamped, the bronchoscopy port on the same side is opened to allow passive lung deflation. Collapse of the nonventilated lung can be facilitated by various maneuvers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H975116067\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Improving deflation of the nonventilated lung'</a>.) </p><p>Choice of a left versus a right DLT is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H80264344\" class=\"local\">'Left versus right double-lumen tubes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2298875014\"><span class=\"h3\">Selecting double-lumen tube size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The largest DLT likely to fit easily within the mainstem bronchus should be used. Although there is no consensus regarding how to select a DLT size for an individual patient, we suggest using the patient's sex and height to choose an appropriate DLT tube size since this method is both simple and effective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87261 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between height and left bronchial diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Other methods are based on radiographic measurements of bronchial diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Limitations of radiologic measurements include availability of appropriate films, difficulty in scaling film measurements to the patient's actual size, and significant discrepancies in actual DLT sizes from different manufacturers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87262\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87262 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>An appropriate DLT size should result in an air leak when the bronchial cuff is deflated, but should be airtight when the cuff is inflated with a volume that is &lt;3 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Generally, the bronchial diameter of the ideal DLT should be 1 to 2 mm smaller than the diameter of the patient's mainstem bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The insertion of an oversized DLT may traumatize or even rupture the trachea or bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Insertion of a DLT that is too small may lead to inadequate lung isolation, increased airway resistance, overinflation of the bronchial cuff, or accidental passage far enough into the bronchus to obstruct the upper lobe of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/10,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2329782734\" class=\"local\">'Minimizing airway trauma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H490611923\"><span class=\"h3\">Positioning left double-lumen tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left DLTs are generally easier to place than right DLTs. The endobronchial tip is inserted through the vocal cords under direct laryngoscopy, the stylet is removed, and the DLT is rotated 90 degrees to the left while being advanced. However, studies have shown that 24 to 39 percent of blind left DLT insertions result in endobronchial intubation of the right mainstem bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]. This is due to the more vertical position of the right mainstem bronchus, which aligns it with the trachea. Turning the patient's head to the right and tilting it toward the right shoulder while advancing the tube may help to avoid the right mainstem bronchus during insertion of a left-sided DLT. In one study, this maneuver resulted in successful placement in the left mainstem bronchus in 92 percent of blind left DLT insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, the position of a left DLT is confirmed by auscultation. Initially, auscultation is performed with both the tracheal and bronchial cuffs inflated; ventilation through both lumens should result in equal bilateral breath sounds if the DLT is properly inserted. Then the tracheal lumen is clamped, and ventilation should result in breath sounds on the left but not the right side. Next the bronchial lumen is clamped, and subsequent ventilation should result in breath sounds on the right but not the left side. An algorithm to correct malposition using the auscultation method is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87263\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87263 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Now, fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is also employed as the gold standard for confirming ideal DLT position. For commonly used adult DLT sizes (35 to 41 French [Fr] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87261 \">table 1</a>)), a bronchoscope &lt;4 mm in diameter will pass through both lumens. For a 32 Fr DLT, a bronchoscope &lt;3.4 mm in diameter is necessary. In a series of 200 procedures in which the DLT position was checked by auscultation followed by bronchoscopy, malpositioning of the DLT was identified by auscultation in 28 patients; however, subsequent FOB identified malpositioning in an additional 79 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>If the left DLT is ideally positioned, the initial bronchoscopic view from the tracheal lumen shows the inflated blue bronchial balloon just visible beyond the carina on the left side without herniation into the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88678\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88678 \">figure 4</a>). Identifying the characteristic appearance of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus on the right, and viewing the right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) originating from the bronchus intermedius further confirms correct insertion of the left bronchial tube into the left mainstem bronchus. If the expected RUL and bronchus intermedius views are not identified, or resistance is encountered while the DLT is being placed, FOB should be used to visualize the tracheobronchial anatomy during insertion. This is accomplished by deflating both cuffs of the left DLT and pulling it back with the bronchoscope positioned at the tip of the bronchial lumen until the carina comes into view. The bronchoscope is then advanced into the left main bronchus to be used as guide over which the left DLT slides into position.</p><p>Next, the bronchoscope is passed down into the bronchial lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88681\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88681 \">figure 5</a>) to ensure that the bronchial tube has not been advanced too far (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88680\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88680 \">figure 6</a>). This is necessary since occlusion of the left upper lobe (LUL) bronchus is a risk if the tube migrates distally (eg, during patient positioning). For this reason, it is also critically important to reconfirm tube position after any change in patient position. In one study, 32 percent of well-positioned DLTs became malpositioned after turning the patient to a lateral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another study, lateral positioning caused 0.92 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 1.15 cm displacement of the bronchial tip in 37 of 50 patients, usually in a proximal direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Malpositioning of a DLT is the most common cause of intraoperative hypoxemia during OLV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a review of 1170 procedures (1166 with left DLTs), hypoxemia during OLV occurred in 3 percent, with attribution to DLT malposition in &gt;60 percent of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1851140320\"><span class=\"h3\">Positioning right double-lumen tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to a left DLT, the bronchial lumen of a right DLT has two orifices, one on the side wall that should be aligned with the takeoff of the RUL bronchus, and one at the tip of the tube to ventilate both the RML and RLL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88679 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>Once the endobronchial tip of the right DLT is passed through the vocal cords under direct laryngoscopy, the stylet is removed, and the DLT is rotated 90 degrees to the right and slightly advanced until the tip of the bronchial lumen is in the mid-trachea. From this mid-tracheal position, the bronchoscope is subsequently passed through the bronchial lumen to inspect the patient's right bronchial tree anatomy and to ensure that proper right DLT placement will be feasible. In 3 percent of patients, the RUL bronchus originates at the level of the carina or even within the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]; in such cases, ideal positioning of a right DLT (with the bronchial cuff between the carina and the RUL bronchus) may not be possible. Next, the right DLT is then advanced into the right mainstem bronchus under direct bronchoscopic visualization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88679 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>Optimal alignment of the bronchial side orifice of the right DLT with the RUL bronchial orifice occurs in two dimensions, requiring insertion to both the appropriate depth and optimal rotation of the DLT. This may be challenging because the RUL bronchus is often difficult to visualize through the opaque tube. When the position of the RUL bronchus is unclear, FOB identification of the bronchus intermedius and the direction of the <span class=\"nowrap\">RML/RLL</span> carina can be helpful. This landmark is followed up proximally since the anterolateral aspect of this carina is often proximal to the orifice of the RUL bronchus within the mainstem bronchus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88679 \">figure 7</a>). Once the side orifice of the bronchial tube is thought to be aligned with the RUL bronchial orifice, the bronchoscope is withdrawn and reinserted through the tracheal lumen to confirm that the right bronchial cuff appears to be correctly positioned within the right mainstem bronchus between the carina and the RUL bronchus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88679 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>Because the right mainstem bronchus is relatively short, proper positioning of the right bronchial cuff while maintaining alignment of the tube side orifice with the RUL bronchial orifice can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If the device is placed slightly deep, occlusion of the RUL bronchus may occur, but if placed too close to the carina it may herniate proximally preventing adequate lung isolation.</p><p>Once ideal positioning of the right-sided lung isolation device is achieved, its location can easily shift during patient repositioning (eg, from supine to lateral position, during neck extension or flexion, or during surgical manipulation), and shifting is more likely with right compared with left DLTs. Since the margin of error for placement and maintenance of right DLT positioning is low, rechecking position with FOB is prudent after any change in patient position and critically important if hypoxemia develops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329782734\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimizing airway trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway rupture is rare with DLTs (&lt;0.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]) but is associated with mortality as high as 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, if the ETT is too small to accommodate both the bronchial blocker and the FOB, the bronchoscope may be placed separately through the glottis on one side of the ETT. The bronchial blocker is then passed via the ETT and positioned with FOB assistance to visualize airway anatomy during final positioning. </p><p>Each type of commercially available bronchial blocker has a unique mechanism to assist placement, but all require FOB guidance.

A single-lumen tubes placed in an endobronchial position (without a bronchial blocker) is rarely used for lung isolation in adults due to lack of access to the nonventilated lung and difficulty in achieving an optimal position in the bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, endobronchial intubation with an ETT may be useful during surgical procedures in selected situations such as a patient with abnormal tracheobronchial anatomy or in an emergency with massive pulmonary hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H734507297\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal tracheobronchial anatomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3536518764\" class=\"local\">'Massive hemoptysis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1716624068\"><span class=\"h3\">Positioning single-lumen tubes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard single-lumen tube &ndash; For a standard ETT, the length of the cuff and the tube beyond it (&gt;4 cm) are longer than a DLT.

Compared with a left DLT, bronchial blockers are also more likely to require repositioning facilitated by fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) during surgery, particularly when placed within the short right mainstem bronchus to achieve right lung isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/7,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,30</a>].</p><p>A 2015 meta-analysis of 39 trials comparing efficacy and adverse effects of DLTs versus bronchial blockers noted that DLTs were typically positioned more quickly (mean difference 51 seconds faster; 95% CI 8-94 seconds faster) and were more likely to be correctly positioned (odds ratio [OR] 2.70, 95% CI 1.18-6.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, blockers were associated with a lower incidence of sore throat (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.68), hoarseness (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.75), and airway injury (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.72). Also, there are no reports of airway rupture resulting from bronchial blocker placement.</p><p>When lung isolation is necessary to prevent soiling or contamination from one lung to the other (eg, due to bleeding or infection), we select a DLT rather than a bronchial blocker because lung isolation can be established before the source is identified, a DLT is less likely to become malpositioned, and the ability to ventilate, suction, or employ FOB is maintained for the pathologic lung. (See <a href=\"#H3906083958\" class=\"local\">'Need for unilateral lung protection'</a> below.)</p><p>Placement of a bronchial blocker is typically selected to achieve lung isolation in patients with a difficult airway (particularly if awake intubation is necessary), for those with a tracheostomy or abnormal tracheobronchial anatomy, or if an endotracheal tube has been previously inserted or prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation is planned.

Left bronchus length is 4 to 6 cm for males, and 3 to 5 cm for females, compared with only 1 to 2 cm length for the right mainstem bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H391779389\" class=\"local\">'Airway anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Positioning of a right DLT requires precision in both depth of insertion and rotation to maintain proper position of the bronchial cuff within the short right mainstem bronchus, and to precisely align the side ventilation orifice with the take-off of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus (see <a href=\"#H1851140320\" class=\"local\">'Positioning right double-lumen tubes'</a> above). Right DLTs are also more challenging to maintain in position compared with left DLTs; thus, complications due to malpositioning may be more common. In one small trial, adequate positioning of a right DLT was maintained in only 37 percent of cases after turning the patient to lie in a lateral decubitus position, and repositioning was required to achieve adequate OLV in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. For these reasons, we restrict their use to situations in which a right DLT is specifically indicated such as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left pneumonectomy (see <a href=\"#H2475633534\" class=\"local\">'Left pneumonectomy or bronchial surgery'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distorted anatomy of the entrance of the left mainstem bronchus due to external or intraluminal left bronchial compression (eg, tumor, descending thoracic aortic aneurysm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Site of surgery that involves the left mainstem bronchus (eg, left-sided lung transplantation, tracheobronchial disruption, pneumonectomy, sleeve resection)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1624566243\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of specific parameters</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H318544591\"><span class=\"h3\">Accessibility of the nonventilated lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DLTs provide superior access to the nonventilated lung because they allow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access to the nonventilated lung for bronchoscopy when necessary, and for suctioning of blood or secretions.

In several trials, the time from laryngoscopy to successful lung isolation is slightly shorter for left DLTs compared with bronchial blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/6-8,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,39</a>].</p><p>The experience of the anesthesiologist is often a more significant factor for speed of device placement than the selected device itself. For example, either a left DLT or a bronchial blocker could be placed within one to four minutes by experienced thoracic anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/6-8,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,39</a>]. However, anesthesiologists with limited experience with lung isolation required six to nine minutes to place either a left DLT or a bronchial blocker in one trial, and one-third of all devices were not properly positioned after their attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Subjective experience is also a factor in evaluating ease of insertion. For example, although time of insertion of an EZ-Blocker bronchial blocker was longer compared with a DLT, ratings of ease were comparable or better for this blocker in some trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>In emergency situations requiring immediate lung isolation (eg, to prevent soiling of a healthy lung with blood or purulent material from the other lung), a single-lumen ETT may be the selected for endobronchial placement to achieve lung isolation. Single-lumen ETTs are readily available in all hospital locations, and clinician familiarity facilitates ease and speed of insertion.

In two trials, bronchial blockers were more likely to require repositioning during surgery than left DLTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/7,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,30</a>]. In one study, Arndt blockers were more frequently displaced compared with Cohen or Fuji blockers, possibly due to the elliptical shape of the original Arndt balloon design (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88386\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88386 \">picture 7</a>); balloon design for this blocker is now spherical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>While malpositioning is generally a benign inconvenience, a life-threatening complication may rarely occur. In one case report, a bronchial blocker in the left mainstem bronchus was displaced into the trachea, causing a &quot;ball valve&quot; effect that blocked airflow into either mainstem bronchus, leading to pulseless electrical activity arrest. This was reversed by deflating the bronchial blocker balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In another case report, distal migration of the DLT bronchial lumen into a lobar bronchus while ventilating with volume control resulted in tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690887610\"><span class=\"h3\">Ability to achieve selective lobar blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients at high risk of desaturation during OLV, the anesthesia provider may select a bronchial blocker to achieve blockade of a single lobe on the surgical side, thereby limiting the extent of hypoxemia while providing adequate surgical exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2064216130\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICE CHOICE: SPECIFIC SITUATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347682701\"><span class=\"h2\">Elective thoracic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most thoracic surgical procedures (eg, lobectomy, wedge resection, thoracoscopy, esophageal surgery), we select a left double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) because these devices are positioned slightly faster and are less likely to become malpositioned during surgery compared with bronchial blockers. For lobectomy procedures, another advantage is the ability to confirm occlusion of the intended lobe via fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) before stapling and transecting the bronchus. (See <a href=\"#H1555895816\" class=\"local\">'Double-lumen tubes versus bronchial blockers'</a> above.)</p><p>However, we may select a bronchial blocker for certain situations, as noted above, since blockers provide comparable surgical exposure compare with left DLTs (see <a href=\"#H1555895816\" class=\"local\">'Double-lumen tubes versus bronchial blockers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3968986026\" class=\"local\">'Quality of lung deflation and reinflation'</a> above).

Use of a left DLT or bronchial blocker during such procedures would necessitate withdrawal of the device from the operative bronchus into the trachea when the left mainstem bronchus is transected. This risks contamination of the nonoperative side with blood and secretions, as well as exposure of the bronchial stump to positive pressure ventilation.</p><p>In rare cases, a lung isolation device or its guidewire has become entrapped in the surgical staple line along the left bronchial stump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thus, the anesthesia provider must ensure that all parts of any device used in a bronchus on the surgical side have been completely retracted prior to staple deployment.

(See <a href=\"#H714698654\" class=\"local\">'Anticipated difficult airway'</a> below and <a href=\"#H147180122\" class=\"local\">'Need for postoperative ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3072375664\"><span class=\"h2\">Presence of a tracheostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with a tracheostomy, we use a bronchial blocker placed either within or alongside a reinforced single-lumen ETT or a disposable cuffed tracheostomy cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. Alternatively, the bronchial blocker may be placed orally through the vocal cords then alongside the tracheostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Although there are reports of use of a small DLT placed via a tracheostomy, positioning can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H714698654\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipated difficult airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing lung isolation in patients who may be difficult to intubate is addressed in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87265\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87265 \">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p>If difficulty with bag-mask ventilation is also anticipated, awake intubation is necessary. This is best accomplished with a single-lumen ETT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. While awake fiberoptic intubation and placement of a DLT has been described, guiding a stiff, large-diameter DLT through the oropharynx over a short, pliable pediatric bronchoscope can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Furthermore, topical local anesthesia is typically inadequate to blunt the intense laryngeal and carinal stimulation that occurs during DLT placement. For patients who cannot be orally intubated, awake nasotracheal intubation with a single-lumen ETT is an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/56,63,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,63,65</a>].</p><p>If mask ventilation is possible, options include either awake intubation, or intubation after induction of general anesthesia with a single-lumen ETT or a DLT. A video laryngoscope may be used post-induction to guide placement of a DLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>When a single-lumen ETT is used to secure a difficult airway, insertion of a bronchial blocker is the easiest and safest means to establish lung isolation. Alternatively, the single-lumen ETT can be replaced with a DLT using an exchange catheter after general anesthesia is established. The airway exchanger should have a hollow center as well as universal adaptors to facilitate oxygenation as needed, and should be at least 83 cm long [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. To avoid airway injury during the exchange, the catheter should not be inserted more than 24 cm at the lips. Once the single-lumen tube is removed, the endobronchial lumen of the DLT may be threaded over the catheter. Visualization of the DLT advancing over the catheter and through the glottis with a either direct laryngoscopy or video laryngoscopy is ideal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Exchange of a nasotracheal single-lumen ETT for an oral DLT has also been described using FOB guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>General considerations for difficult airway management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147180122\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for postoperative ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard single-lumen ETTs cause less irritation of the carina and less minor airway trauma, and are more familiar to nursing staff in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or ICU. A disadvantage of using a DLT compared with a bronchial blocker is the need to exchange a DLT for a single-lumen tube at the end of a surgical procedure in patients who will require prolonged postoperative controlled ventilation. </p><p>Some clinicians have the perception that DLTs have higher airway resistance compared with single-lumen ETTs, which would make ventilator weaning more difficult. However, airway resistance is not a compelling reason to change a 37 French (Fr) or larger DLT if the exchange may be difficult. In a study comparing airway devices for small adults, a size 37Fr DLT resulted in less airflow resistance than an ETT with a 7.5 inner diameter (ID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The device with the highest resistance in this study was a 7.5 mm ID Univent tube since a large portion of its cross-sectional area is occupied by the bronchial blocker channel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F88388\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88388 \">picture 9</a>). Thus, a Univent tube &lt;7.5 mm ID should be changed to a standard ETT for postoperative ventilation as soon as possible.</p><p>If only a short period of postoperative ventilation is necessary, a left DLT may be left in place. However, a right DLT should not be left in place during the postoperative period because of the likelihood that it will become malpositioned with patient movement.</p><p>For bronchial blockers inserted via a large (&ge;8 mm ID) single-lumen ETT to achieve lung isolation, risks associated with tube exchange are avoided. At the end of the surgical procedure the blocker balloon is deflated and the blocker is then simply removed. In rare instances, unanticipated difficulty with reexpansion of a collapsed lung after use of a bronchial blocker may occur due to inability to deflate the blocker balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-isolation-techniques/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

Right DLTs and bronchial blockers are more difficult to place and more likely to move during surgery, requiring repositioning facilitated by FOB. However, bronchial blockers may be associated with fewer complications (eg, sore throat, hoarseness, or airway injury including airway rupture). (See <a href=\"#H1555895816\" class=\"local\">'Double-lumen tubes versus bronchial blockers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H80264344\" class=\"local\">'Left versus right double-lumen tubes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H347682701\" class=\"local\">'Elective thoracic surgery'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For surgery involving the left mainstem bronchus, including left pneumonectomy, we use a right DLT to avoid interference with the surgical field.
