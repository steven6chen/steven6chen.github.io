It contains thick, brown, tar-like fluid, which may be referred to as a &quot;chocolate cyst.&quot; Endometriomas are often densely adherent to surrounding structures, such as the peritoneum, fallopian tubes, and bowel. This topic will review management of ovarian endometriomas. Information on adnexal masses and the clinical diagnosis and management of endometriosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363548427\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of endometrioma treatment are to relieve symptoms (eg, pain or mass), prevent complications related to the adnexal mass (eg, rupture or torsion), exclude malignancy, improve subfertility, and preserve ovarian function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Relief of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriomas that cause pain or a mass effect are removed to relieve the patient's symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56270874\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of cyst complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enlarging cysts are removed because they increase the risk for ovarian torsion, cyst rupture, and the possibility of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency.

For this reason, endometriomas are removed if they have an atypical appearance on imaging studies or other concerning features (eg, enlarging size) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2625026494\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Link to cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6362327\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of subfertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excision of endometriomas improves pregnancy rates in subfertile women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study of women with subfertility and endometriomas, excision of the endometrioma was associated with an increased spontaneous pregnancy rate compared with women who had cyst wall ablation only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Conception and pregnancy rates are <strong>not</strong> improved when endometriomas are treated with hormonal treatments such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>].</p><p>In contrast, endometrioma resection has not been shown to improve in vitro <span class=\"nowrap\">fertilization/intracytoplasmic</span> sperm injection outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Women undergoing in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection should consider endometrioma resection only if they are having symptoms (eg, pain or mass) or to exclude malignancy, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238460076\"><span class=\"h2\">Preservation of ovarian function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An endometrioma itself does not alter ovarian function. In a study of 244 women with unilateral endometriomas (55 percent with left endometrioma and 45 percent with right endometrioma) monitored for ovulation during 1199 cycles, ovulation occurred at similar rates from the normal ovary and the endometriotic ovary (49.7 percent versus 50.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although the endometrioma may reduce the number of follicles recruited in the ovary by exogenous FSH stimulation, there is no evidence that the cyst has an effect on pregnancy or live birth rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In contrast, ovarian surgery to remove the endometrioma can reduce ovarian reserve as assessed by anti-Mullerian hormone levels, but not by antral follicle count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]. A meta-analysis of eight studies of endometrioma cystectomy reported 38 percent lower anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone levels in women after ovarian cystectomy compared with before cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ovarian cystectomy for bilateral endometriomas may result in a greater reduction in AMH levels than unilateral ovarian cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It is unclear if anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone, one marker of ovarian reserve, falls because of surgical trauma to the ovary or removal of normal ovarian tissue and follicles. A prospective study that assessed ovarian function reported a greater loss of ovarian tissue and antral follicles in the women undergoing repeat surgery compared with women undergoing primary endometrioma resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The authors cautioned against repeat surgical intervention for endometriomas. Therefore, the decision to proceed with ovarian surgery requires a careful discussion with the patient regarding the impact on ovarian function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Adequate ovarian reserve'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238460322\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management options include surgical removal (ie, cystectomy) and observation with serial imaging. While medical therapy is an effective treatment for pelvic pain caused by endometriosis, it has no benefits over observation for management of endometriomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/1,2,4,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,21</a>].

Risks of surgical resection include potential decreased ovarian reserve after resection and standard surgical risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/17,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation preserves ovarian function and avoids surgical risk. The risks of observation include lack of histologic diagnosis, inability to exclude malignancy, and potential for disease progression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363548546\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We take the following approach to our patients with endometriomas:</p><p>For women with known endometriosis and a symptomatic or expanding suspected endometrioma, we suggest cystectomy, preferably by the laparoscopic route. We perform frozen section evaluation in cases with suspicious or unusual morphology. After surgical resection, we recommend long-term treatment with an estrogen-progestin contraceptive to prevent endometrioma recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H59277397\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2584950329\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Gross and microscopic pathology'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, we suggest observation of small (generally less than 5 cm) and asymptomatic cysts that have the imaging-based characteristics of an endometrioma, in agreement with society recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Observation over time allows other benign ovarian cysts that can be confused for an endometrioma, such as hemorrhagic cysts, to regress. Also, as surgical resection reduces ovarian hormone production, observation in asymptomatic women with subfertility or older reproductive age (age greater than 37) helps preserve ovarian function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/17,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24,25</a>].</p><p>For endometriomas that are being observed, a typical management plan involves physical examination and ultrasound every six months for one to two years, followed by annual examination and ultrasound if the adnexal mass has remained unchanged in size and clinical characteristics. Women can be managed for many years using this conservative approach. However, increasing cyst volume or complexity on a scan should prompt closer follow-up (3 rather than 6 or 12 months). Two consecutive scans demonstrating increased cyst volume, change in complexity of the cyst, or development of symptoms should prompt surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who elect surgical therapy, first-line treatment is cystectomy because cystectomy removes the endometriosis but leaves the normal ovary. Oophorectomy, or removal of the ovary with the cyst intact, is a definitive treatment that is mainly used in women who have recurrent cysts, have completed childbearing, are postmenopausal, or who have concerns for malignancy. There are no data to support the use of preoperative medical suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative surgery (cystectomy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystectomy, preferably by laparoscopy, is preferred to cyst drainage or cyst wall ablation for the treatment of pelvic pain or infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Aspiration alone is ineffective; recurrence rates of 80 to 100 percent have been reported at six months follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Fenestration and ablation (ie, removal of part of the cyst wall followed by the coagulation or laser vaporization of the inner side of the wall) is also less effective than cystectomy, both in terms of improving fertility and reducing pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>]. Cyst sclerotherapy has also been attempted as a less invasive alternative to cystectomy. However, the endometrioma recurrence rate after sclerotherapy has been reported to be as high as 63 percent, without an improvement in clinical pregnancy rate when compared with traditional cystectomy or no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sclerotherapy consists of injecting a sclerosing agent (ethanol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) into the cyst cavity and is thought to disrupt the cyst epithelial lining, which results in inflammation, fibrosis, and, ultimately, obliteration of the cyst. </p><p>In a 2008 meta-analysis of women with subfertility and endometriomas, women undergoing cystectomy had nearly three times as many pregnancies (54 versus 17 percent) and half as many recurrences (13 versus 26 percent) as women undergoing cyst wall ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, at least one small study has reported a lower reduction in ovarian reserve with cyst ablation rather than cystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, women must balance the treatment of pain and infertility with the potential negative impact of ovarian cystectomy on ovarian reserve. The general procedure for ovarian cystectomy is described separately. (See <a href=\"#H238460076\" class=\"local\">'Preservation of ovarian function'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Attention to technique appears to be crucial to preserving ovarian function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Issues specific to endometrioma removal include the method of cyst removal, choice of hemostatic agent, and the extent of adjacent disease. Stripping the cyst wall instead of performing a circular excision around the cyst limits the number of normal ovarian follicles removed with the specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A histologic analysis of endometriomas showed endometriosis of the inner cyst wall rarely penetrates more than 1.5 mm into the cyst capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The hemostatic technique used on the ovary has been reported to impact the postoperative anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Two different meta-analyses reported hemostatic sealants and suture caused less reduction in AMH levels compared with bipolar cautery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. We agree with the authors&rsquo; suggestion to limit the use of bipolar electrocoagulation on the ovary.</p><p>In our experience, endometrioma removal is often more difficult than the removal of other benign ovarian cysts because the contents of the endometrioma can chronically leak into the peritoneal cavity. This leakage causes dense scarring to structures adjacent to the cyst, making complete cystectomy more challenging. Many women with endometriomas also have other benign ovarian cysts, such as hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts or follicular cysts. While these adjacent cysts often increase the difficulty of endometrioma removal, they are left in situ when possible in an effort to retain as much normal ovarian tissue as possible.</p><p>As cystectomy of endometriomas can be quite difficult, we discuss the potential need for oophorectomy with all women planning surgery. If there is extensive scarring around the ovary containing the endometrioma, the patient may benefit from an &quot;en bloc&quot; dissection of the ovary and surrounding tissue to reduce the risk of leaving behind a small piece of ovary. This dissection may necessitate opening the retroperitoneum, identifying and isolating the ureter, and ligating the infundibulopelvic ligament near the pelvic brim to avoid operating near the diseased tissue. Frozen section is performed in cases with suspicious or unusual morphology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive surgery (oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oophorectomy is reserved for women with recurrent symptomatic endometriomas or in women with concerns for malignancy on imaging. Unilateral oophorectomy resolves symptoms and reduces the risk of endometrioma recurrence. However, even after oophorectomy, the patient can develop an adnexal mass or recurrent pain because of a retained retroperitoneal ovarian remnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Ovarian remnant syndrome'</a>.) </p><p>The impact of unilateral oophorectomy on ovarian hormone production is unclear. Most studies that assess hormone production from the remaining ovary have looked at women undergoing hysterectomy with and without unilateral oophorectomy. In studies of women having hysterectomy, the time interval to ovarian failure is shorter for the women who have unilateral oophorectomy in addition to hysterectomy, which raises concern that oophorectomy alone may reduce residual ovarian function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. Premature loss of ovarian function is associated with increased risk for cognitive impairment and cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>Bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is reserved for women who have debilitating symptoms, have failed other therapies, and have completed childbearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59277397\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with society guidelines that women surgically treated for symptoms should be treated postoperatively to prevent recurrence, unless pregnancy is being attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Studies report that long-term use (greater than six months) of oral contraceptives (OCs) reduces the risk of endometrioma recurrence and the frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. In a meta-analysis of three cohort studies and one randomized trial including 965 women, women who always used OCs had a lower risk of recurrent endometrioma compared with women who never used OCs (8 versus 34 percent; odds ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a meta-analysis of three trials and one prospective cohort study that assessed the impact of cyclic or continuous OC regimens after endometrioma resection, women who used continuous OC regimens reported lower recurrent dysmenorrhea rates compared with women who used cyclic OC regimens (risk ratio 0.24, 95% CI 0.06-0.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Continuous OC use was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in endometrioma recurrence (risk ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.28-1.05, p = 0.7). Thus, while postoperative treatment with either a cyclic or continuous OC regimen is reasonable, continuous-dose OC regimens may provide some additional benefit. Combined therapy with estrogen and progestin is preferred to progestin treatment alone. A study of endometrioma cells reported that cell growth was suppressed more by combination therapy with ethynyl <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> and progestin than by progestins alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>Another option for postoperative suppressive therapy is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. One limitation is that GnRH agonists, with or without add-back therapy, are approved for six months of use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Add-back therapy reduces the risk of osteoporosis, but this is an off-label use. Since there is no demonstrable advantage of long-term GnRH plus add-back over OCs, the expense and ease of treatment favor OC long-term management for women who are candidates for combined OCs. </p><p>While a meta-analysis of three studies supports the use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNg IUD) to decrease dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis, it is not clear if the LNg IUD reduces endometrioma recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of 99 women who underwent laparoscopic cystectomy for endometrioma followed by three cycles on GnRH agonist treatment, the recurrence rate was similar among women who then received either an LNg IUD or cyclic OCs (median 17 months of follow-up) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In a subsequent trial of 80 women with endometriomas who underwent laparoscopic cystectomy followed by six months of GnRH agonist treatment and were then randomly assigned to either LNg IUD or placebo, rate of endometrioma recurrence at 30 months of follow-up did not differ between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, the women who received the LNg IUD did report a nearly 70 percent reduction in the recurrence of dysmenorrhea. Until further data are available from larger trials, we do not advise LNg IUD insertion for prevention of endometrioma recurrence and instead offer women treatment with oral contraceptives as described above. A detailed discussion of the postoperative treatment of endometriosis is provided separately.

In a study of 289 women who had undergone endometrioma resection, risk factors for endometrioma recurrence included removal of a cyst &gt; 8 cm, younger age (&lt;25 years), and preoperative cyst rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. As a recurrent endometrioma can be difficult to distinguish from a malignancy, recurrent endometriomas should be evaluated to exclude malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass#H11757752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Excluding urgent conditions or malignancy'</a>.) </p><p>For women with an endometrioma recurrence, repeat cystectomy may be more damaging to the ovary than initial cystectomy. One study of 11 women undergoing endometrioma cystectomy reported that the cyst wall specimen was thicker and contained more normal ovarian tissue in the recurrent endometrioma group as compared with the primary endometrioma resection group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The recurrent endometrioma resection group also had a reduced antral follicle count and ovarian volume on follow-up ultrasound study. In another study that compared 18 women undergoing a second unilateral endometrioma resection with 18 women who underwent a primary resection only, the repeat resection group had decreased anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) levels, higher basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and lower antral follicle counts compared with the primary resection group. Of note, the values for AMH, FSH, and antral follicle count were not different between the groups after the primary surgery, which indicates the second surgery had an increased negative impact on ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1496917012\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H363548427\" class=\"local\">'Treatment goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management options include cystectomy and observation with serial imaging. (See <a href=\"#H238460322\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical resection provides a definitive diagnosis, symptom relief, and exclusion of malignancy. Risks of surgical resection include potential decreased ovarian reserve after resection and standard surgical risks. (See <a href=\"#H238460322\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Observation preserves ovarian function and avoids surgical risk. The risks of observation include lack of histologic diagnosis, inability to exclude malignancy, and potential for disease progression. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Medical therapy is not an option for first-line management because it does not resolve endometriomas or treat their symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H238460322\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with symptomatic or expanding endometriomas are managed surgically. (See <a href=\"#H363548546\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with small and asymptomatic cysts that have the imaging-based characteristics of an endometrioma, we suggest observation rather than excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prefer observation for women with a known diagnosis of endometriosis as excision may damage ovarian reserve. (See <a href=\"#H363548546\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with pain or infertility from an endometrioma, we recommend cystectomy rather than fenestration and ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Fenestration and ablation are less effective than cystectomy in reducing pain and improving fertility. We perform laparoscopic cystectomy with the stripping technique to preserve normal ovarian tissue. Aspiration is ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Conservative surgery (cystectomy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oophorectomy is reserved for women with recurrent symptomatic endometriomas or in cysts with imaging findings concerning for malignancy. Bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is limited to women who have debilitating symptoms, have failed other therapies, and have completed childbearing. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Definitive surgery (oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend postoperative use of oral contraceptive therapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Oral contraceptive therapy greater than six months duration reduces endometrioma recurrence (see <a href=\"#H59277397\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above). We prescribe combined oral contraceptives; either a cyclic or continuous regimen is reasonable depending on patient preference.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chapron C, Vercellini P, Barakat H, et al.
