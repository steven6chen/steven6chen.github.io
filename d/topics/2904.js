Numerous observational studies in both men and women have demonstrated that regular exercise and physical fitness are both associated with a reduced risk of coronary events and coronary death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients who are eligible for and require exercise training as part of their recovery do not receive such therapy, often because of lack of awareness by healthcare professionals, by patients and their families, and by healthcare insurers of the appropriateness and effectiveness of an exercise intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Based upon these observations and the demonstrated benefit of risk factor reduction, cardiac rehabilitation programs were developed to provide exercise training and counseling on risk factor modification for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

They limit the physiologic and psychologic effects of cardiac illness, reduce the risk of sudden death or reinfarction, control cardiac symptoms, stabilize or reverse the atherosclerotic process, and enhance the psychosocial and vocational status of selected patients. Cardiac rehabilitation improves risk factors, exercise capacity, medication adherence to secondary preventive therapies, and survival after percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of cardiac rehabilitation programs will be reviewed here.

The following indications are now covered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and many third party payers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute MI within the preceding 12 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CABG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable angina pectoris</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart valve <span class=\"nowrap\">repair/replacement</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous coronary intervention with or without stenting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart or heart-lung transplant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic systolic heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral arterial disease</p><p/><p>Other candidates for cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">rehabilitation/secondary</span> prevention programs include those with diabetes, pulmonary artery hypertension, and congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Many studies presented in this topic focus on the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with recent MI or acute coronary syndrome. However, there has been wide acceptance of the benefits of supervised exercise programs for most patients with coronary heart disease. Rehabilitation services for patients with coronary artery revascularization procedures using either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery and for patients with stable angina are covered by Medicare and many third party payers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Referral for cardiac rehabilitation is recommended in most contemporary clinical practice guidelines, including those for ST-segment elevation MI, unstable <span class=\"nowrap\">angina/non-ST</span> segment elevation MI, chronic stable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, and CABG.</p><p>Indications for exercise in older patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults#H1981662\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation in older adults&quot;, section on 'Exercise in older adults'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program improves outcomes such as survival or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with acute MI or prior revascularization. The evidence of benefit is less strong in patients with stable angina pectoris. While all components of cardiac rehabilitation programs are important for long-term benefit, the relative strengths of the components are not known. Exercise training is the best studied and we believe it is reasonable to assume it is a major important component. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs are associated with improved survival and a lower rate of MI in patients with acute MI or prior revascularization. Several meta-analyses have evaluated exercise rehabilitation alone or as a component of multifactorial rehabilitation with risk-factor education and counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In the individual studies, the patient populations varied somewhat, but most individuals had a recent MI. </p><p>In a 2016 meta-analysis of 63 trials that randomly assigned 14,486 patients to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation or no referral following MI or revascularization, the intervention was associated with the following benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower risk of cardiovascular death (relative risk [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.64-0.86) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower risk of hospital admission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.96).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant effect on rates of all-cause death, MI, or revascularization.</p><p/><p>For patients with stable coronary disease, the evidence to support its use is weaker. A 2018 systematic review of seven studies (n = 581) that compared cardiac rehabilitation with no exercise control found no clear evidence of benefit in terms of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.01, 95% CI 0.18-5.67), acute MI (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07-1.63), or cardiovascular-related hospital admissions (RR 0.14, 95% C I 0.02-1.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The authors articulated their concerns about the small sample size, the risk of bias, and the possibility of imprecision.</p><p>In studies of stable patients who undergo coronary revascularization, a reduction in all-cause mortality as high as 5 percent (compared to control groups receiving usual care) has been seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Improvement in functional capacity and a delay in the onset of ischemia have also been shown to result from completion of an exercise training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The benefits of exercise training in patients with coronary artery disease is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The issue of whether cardiac rehabilitation is of benefit in patients with coronary artery disease who undergo PCI has been addressed in a few studies, which have included patients with and without acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The following are two representative examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study of over 600,000 older Medicare patients with coronary artery disease, three separate statistical analyses of those who had undergone PCI showed significantly lower one- to five-year mortality rates (approximately 30 percent) in users of cardiac rehabilitation compared with non-users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of data from an Olmsted county registry of nearly 2400 patients who underwent PCI (the majority of whom had recent ACS), there was a significant reduction (nearly 50 percent) in five-year all-cause mortality of those who underwent cardiac rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) also benefit from cardiac rehabilitation. In a community-based analysis of 846 individuals who underwent CABG between 1996 and 2007, and who survived at least six months, those who participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program (compared to those who had not) had a lower incidence of all-cause mortality (adjusted) at 10 years (23.0 versus 35.7 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Exercise rehabilitation may have benefits in addition to reductions in recurrent MI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Improvement in functional capacity, including an increase in the activity threshold before the onset of ischemia, and a reduction in symptoms can enable return to work as well as to leisure and recreational activities. For elderly patients, moderate increases in functional capacity can help maintain independent living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors may contribute to the benefit of exercise rehabilitation. Well-described effects include improvement in the lipid profile, a reduction in blood pressure, and treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a randomized trial of 74 overweight patients with coronary artery disease, high-calorie expenditure exercise (3000 to 3500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/week),</span> compared with standard cardiac rehabilitation exercise (700 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/week),</span> was associated with a significantly greater weight loss and a more favorable cardiometabolic risk profile with the high-calorie expenditure approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Other factors also may contribute. These include a reduction in inflammation, as manifested by a decrease in serum C-reactive protein concentration that is independent of weight loss and other medical therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and possibly ischemic preconditioning. Exercise is also associated with improved endothelial function and a more favorable fibrinolytic balance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-ischemic-conditioning-clinical-implications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial ischemic conditioning: Clinical implications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exercise training has beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients following MI, including a lower heart rate and blood pressure for a given level of exertion and improvement in aerobic capacity averaging 20 percent. Resistance (strength) training, when superimposed on aerobic training, improves skeletal muscle strength and endurance. More important are reductions in both mortality and recurrent MI.</p><p>Abnormal heart rate recovery predicts mortality. In a study of 544 patients with abnormal baseline heart rate recovery before a Phase II Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, heart rate recovery improved in 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There was a strong association of abnormal heart rate recovery at program exit with all-cause mortality; however, patients with an abnormal heart rate recovery at baseline who normalized their heart rate recovery with exercise training had mortality similar to that of individuals with baseline normal heart recovery.</p><p>Exercise training after MI also may improve left ventricular function and attenuate remodeling. These benefits were demonstrated in the Exercise in Left Ventricular Dysfunction (ELVD) trial in which the efficacy of exercise was evaluated in patients with a first Q wave MI and a left ventricular ejection fraction below 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A six-month exercise training program increased both exercise capacity and the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 34 to 38 percent), while left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes were unchanged compared to increased volumes in the control group. In a 2011 systematic review, a beneficial effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling was shown in clinically stable patients following MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The greatest benefit occurred when training started earlier following MI (from one week) and lasted longer than three months.</p><p>Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation had favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, blood pressure, body weight, and lipid profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possible benefit of reducing emotional distress and depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial factors in acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Depression after a myocardial infarction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-factors-in-coronary-and-cerebral-vascular-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial factors in coronary and cerebral vascular disease&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p>The following studies have attempted to evaluate the role of stress management in patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation programs or those with recent MI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of individuals with coronary heart disease, 151 individuals were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation or cardiac rehabilitation combined with stress management training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After a median follow-up of 3.2 years, patients in the cardiac rehabilitation plus stress management training group had greater reduction in composite stress levels (p = 0.02). In addition, the stress management group had a lower rate of clinical events (18 versus 33 percent; hazard ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.95), although the number of events was small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the randomized ENRICHD trial of psychosocial interventions in 2481 patients after MI, patients receiving psychosocial intervention had less depression and better levels of perceived social support, but there was no reduction in mortality (24 percent in both groups at a mean follow-up of 29 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of 134 patients with stable coronary heart disease (57 percent with a prior MI) and exercise-induced ischemia, the patients were assigned to usual medical care alone, with exercise training for 35 minutes three times per week, or with 1.5 hours of stress management training for 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Compared to usual care, exercise and stress management were associated with significant reductions in general distress and depressive symptoms (without between-group differences in hostility or anxiety measures), and with significant improvements in markers of cardiovascular risk, such as a smaller reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction during mental stress testing and a lower mean wall motion abnormality score in patients with significant stress-induced wall motion abnormalities at baseline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressive symptoms were assessed by questionnaire and mortality was evaluated at 40 months in over 500 consecutive coronary patients completing versus not completing rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Depressed patients had an over fourfold increase in mortality, 22 versus 5 percent, versus nondepressed patients; depressed patients completing rehabilitation had a substantially lower mortality, 8 versus 30 percent. Decreased depressive symptoms and decreased mortality were associated with improved fitness, with only modest improvement in fitness levels needed to produce these benefits. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519015287\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of program completion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benefits of cardiac rehabilitation obviously occur only if the patient attends and completes an appropriate program. This issue was addressed in a prospective cohort study of 5886 patients following coronary angiography (70 percent after an ACS) subsequently referred for cardiac rehabilitation between 1996 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of these, 2432 did not start, 554 started but did not complete, and 2900 completed a program. The median length of follow-up was 5.4 years and the median time to enrollment (among those who participated) was 84 days. The patients who completed cardiac rehabilitation, compared to the combination of non-completers and non-enrollers, had a lower risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.49-0.84) and all-cause hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.84). The rate of survival was similar between non-enrollers and non-completers. In a propensity-matched analysis, patients who attended 36 sessions had a 22 percent lower risk of death than those who completed 12 sessions (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.87). Similar findings have been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of participation in a cardiac rehabilitation as described above may decline with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Whether continued intervention leads to preservation or further improvement in the benefits seen in patients who completed cardiac rehabilitation programs was evaluated in the ELMI trial.</p><p>In ELMI, 322 patients were randomly assigned to usual care or ongoing intervention (exercise sessions, telephone follow-up, counseling sessions, and reports to the participants' family physicians) that required a total of 16 hours of direct participant contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-indications-efficacy-and-safety-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. At four years, the Framingham risk score, total and low density lipoprotein-cholesterols were significantly lower compared to baseline in the intervention group but not in the usual care group.

The age-adjusted death rate for CHD in men and women fell from 543 to 267 and from 263 to 134 per 100,000 population, respectively.
