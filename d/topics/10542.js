It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of all individuals have COPD, including approximately 10 percent of individuals 65 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The true prevalence is likely higher because COPD is both under-recognized and under-diagnosed. COPD is the third leading cause of death among adults in the US and is expected to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The management of stable COPD will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, natural history, risk factors, comorbidities, and prognosis of COPD, the management of refractory COPD, and treatment of acute exacerbations are discussed separately.

Non-pharmacologic interventions include: (1) smoking cessation, (2) reduction of other risk factors (eg, exposure to open cooking fires), (3) vaccinations, (4) oxygen therapy, and (5) pulmonary rehabilitation. </p><p>In the following sections, various pharmacologic therapies for COPD and the clinical evidence for each therapy are reviewed. Pharmacotherapy is generally added in a stepwise fashion, depending upon the level of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, and response to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54300 \">table 1</a>). However, for patients who present with more severe disease, a stepwise approach may not always be the best choice, as it may be necessary to initiate several medications at once to achieve appropriate symptom and exacerbation control. An approach to the management of patients with stable COPD is outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Summary and recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p>The mainstays of drug therapy of stable symptomatic COPD are inhaled bronchodilators (beta agonists and anticholinergics) given alone or in combination with inhaled glucocorticoids. These are generally administered via hand held inhalation in the form of metered dose, soft mist, or dry powder inhalers, although some patients may benefit from therapy administered by nebulization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1746147742\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of COPD has been made, several important initial steps are appropriate for the majority of patients, including smoking cessation and avoidance of various other inhalational particulate exposures, vaccination against respiratory infections, education about medication usage, and initiation of a short-acting beta-agonist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3629178100\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Encouraging smoking cessation is an essential step in COPD management. Smoking cessation can reduce the rate of decline in lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>]) that occurs in smokers with COPD. </p><p>As an example, the Lung Health Study reported a decline in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of 54.2 and 66.1 mL in women and men, respectively, who continued to smoke over an 11 year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Women and men who were sustained quitters of smoking had a significantly lower decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 21.5 and 30.2 mL per year, respectively.</p><p>Interventions that assist smoking cessation include clinician advice and encouragement, nicotine replacement therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a>, and behavioral counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The best cessation rates are achieved when counseling is combined with medication therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2897459138\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaccinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is a common cause of COPD exacerbation. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination can help reduce infections and exacerbations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age-appropriate pneumococcal vaccination should be offered to all patients with COPD. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23, Pneumovax) is advised for patients under age 65 years; PPSV23 and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, Prevnar) are advised for patients age 65 years and older, according to the intervals described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103816 \">table 2</a>).

In a randomized trial of 125 patients with COPD, vaccination reduced the incidence of influenza by 76 percent, regardless of the severity of underlying COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The influenza vaccination itself does not increase the risk of acute exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A partnership between the patient and clinician can help improve patient adherence to the medical regimen by incorporating the patient&rsquo;s symptoms, concerns, and goals into medication selection. Appropriate patient education topics include reducing risk factors (eg, cigarette smoke exposure), appropriate administration and use of medications, recognizing and treating exacerbations and complications, minimizing dyspnea, using long-term supplemental oxygen, and making end-of-life decisions. The benefits of patient education include enhanced health, better adherence to the treatment plan, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer emergency visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-rehabilitation#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary rehabilitation&quot;, section on 'Education'</a> and <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhaler technique</strong> &ndash; Education about proper inhaler technique is an essential component of COPD management. Guidelines recommend that a short-acting bronchodilator be prescribed for relief of intermittent symptoms in all patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This initial prescription is an excellent time to focus on correct inhaler technique whether a metered-dose or soft mist inhaler is prescribed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93600 \">table 5</a>). The clinician should demonstrate correct technique, observe the patient practice, and provide correction, if needed. Difficulties with actuation-inhalation coordination may be reduced by use of a valved holding chamber (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72731 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults#H74579851\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;, section on 'MDI technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults#H347194516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;, section on 'Soft mist inhaler technique'</a> and <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At follow-up visits, inhaler technique should be reviewed and correct technique reinforced. When other types of inhalers are prescribed, education about the technique of each additional inhaler is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51020\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51020 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F109205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109205 \">table 7</a>).

In a systematic review of 23 studies (3189 participants), COPD self-management improved quality of life, reduced respiratory-related hospital admissions (odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.94), and ameliorated dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, several studies have not been able to support a role for self-management in COPD and a randomized trial with 426 participants found an unexplained increase in mortality in the self-management group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4087709281\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is no magic COPD diet, it is reasonable to advise patients to follow a generally healthy diet and aim to achieve a normal body mass index (BMI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For overweight and obese patients, excess weight can contribute to dyspnea, and weight loss can help improve exercise tolerance and reduce dyspnea. Conversely, some patients with advanced COPD develop pulmonary cachexia (eg, a weight &lt;90 percent of ideal body weight, or a BMI &le;20), which is associated with diaphragmatic weakness and reduced survival. The effect of low BMI on survival is also reflected in the inclusion of a BMI &le;21 as a marker of more severe disease in the BODE index, which assesses mortality risk (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

Studies are underway to determine whether vitamin D and other nutritional supplements can reduce exacerbations and improve lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing disease pattern and severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multi-component assessment system has been developed by GOLD to guide therapy for COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The GOLD system, which was revised in 2017, categorizes patients based on assessment of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations and hospitalizations. Each patient is classified as being in one of four categorizes (A,B,C,D), as described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54300 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], based on these features: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms are assessed using a validated instrument, such as the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 8</a>) or the COPD Assessment Test (CAT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exacerbation risk is based on the patient&rsquo;s history of exacerbations in the past year; two or more exacerbations and one or more hospitalizations indicate a greater future risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23,24</a>]. </p><p/><p>Although the severity of the decrement in FEV<sub>1</sub> is inversely associated with COPD exacerbation risk, FEV<sub>1</sub> as a standalone measurement does not predict risk of exacerbations for individual patients. For this reason, FEV<sub>1</sub> is no longer included in the 2017 ABCD assessment categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Nevertheless, spirometry measurement of the presence and severity of airflow limitation (based on a FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.7 and FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 9</a>) are still required to confirm the diagnosis of COPD and to calculate the BODE index. The multidimensional BODE index can be used to assess an individual's risk of death or hospitalization due to COPD (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), but is not recommended by GOLD as a guide to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Indeed, most COPD treatment studies have tested therapeutic value of a given medication across a wide range of patients and the given treatment value and impact on a specific GOLD disease category has only, at best, been assessed with post-hoc study analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H242460947\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMALLY SYMPTOMATIC, LOW RISK OF EXACERBATION (CATEGORY A)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients with COPD, we recommend that a short-acting bronchodilator be used as-needed for relief of intermittent increases in dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If patients have minimally symptomatic COPD and are at low risk of exacerbation (ie, modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] grade 0 to 1 or COPD Assessment Test [CAT] score &lt;10; and 0 to 1 exacerbation per year), this is usually the only medication needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54300 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Bronchodilators have been consistently shown to induce long-term improvements in symptoms, exercise capacity, and airflow limitation, even when there is no spirometric improvement following a single test dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>].</p><p>A regularly scheduled long-acting bronchodilator should be added if symptoms are inadequately controlled with short-acting bronchodilator therapy or if the patient is at greater risk for poor outcomes (eg, frequent exacerbations, more severe disease).

All of the short-acting bronchodilators improve symptoms and lung function. The advantage of short-acting beta agonists is their rapid onset of action; the disadvantage for patients with more frequent symptoms is the short duration of action, about four to six hours.</p><p>Combination therapy is often preferred because the combination of a short-acting beta agonist plus a short-acting anticholinergic achieves a greater bronchodilator response than either one alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

However, in a nested case control study of 76,661 patients with COPD, the rate of severe cardiac arrhythmia was elevated among those with new use of oral or inhaled short-acting beta agonist (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Cardiac arrests were characterized as arrhythmia events; among nonfatal arrhythmias, atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/flutter</span> was most common.

Risks of beta-agonist overuse are possible if an individual attempts to achieve maximal bronchodilation by using higher doses. These risks include tremor and reflex tachycardia due, in part, to peripheral arterial dilation. Hypokalemia can also occur in extreme cases and should be monitored in patients at risk. Oral beta-2 agonists are generally not prescribed because their incidence of side effects is particularly high.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A categorization system for COPD severity has been developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). This system, which defines disease severity according to the frequency and severity of symptoms and the risk of exacerbations and hospitalization, can be used as a guide for the management of patients with stable COPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54300 \">table 1</a>). Symptoms are assessed using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 8</a>) or the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessing disease pattern and severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with COPD, we recommend that a short-acting bronchodilator (eg, beta-agonist, anticholinergic agent) be prescribed for use as-needed for relief of intermittent increases in dyspnea (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients not on a long-acting anticholinergic agent, a combination short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) PLUS a short-acting muscarinic agent (SAMA, also called a short-acting anticholinergic agent), rather than either alone, may be prescribed to achieve a greater acute bronchodilator benefit. For patients on a long-acting anticholinergic agent, a short-acting beta agonist is generally used for quick relief of COPD symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2789990932\" class=\"local\">'Short-acting bronchodilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For category A patients who are minimally symptomatic (ie, mMRC grade &lt;2) and at low risk of exacerbation (ie, 0 to 1 exacerbation per year), either a SABA or a SAMA can be used as needed for relief or prevention of symptoms; a combination SABA-SAMA can be used if the single agent is insufficient. (See <a href=\"#H242460947\" class=\"local\">'Minimally symptomatic, low risk of exacerbation (Category A)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For category B patients who are more symptomatic (ie, mMRC grade &ge;2 or CAT score &ge;10), but at low risk of exacerbation based on their past history of exacerbations (ie, 0 to 1 exacerbation per year), we recommend regular use of a long-acting inhaled bronchodilator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86426 \">table 8</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In our clinical practice, we prefer a long-acting inhaled muscarinic agents (LAMA, also known as a long-acting anticholinergic agent) to the twice daily long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). However, a once daily LABA is a reasonable alternative depending on the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and potential medication adverse effects. If a single long-acting bronchodilator does not control symptoms, we recommend adding a second long-acting bronchodilator from the other class (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H294108250\" class=\"local\">'More symptomatic, low risk of exacerbation (Category B)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For category C patients who are minimally symptomatic on a day-to-day basis (ie, mMRC grade 0 to 1 or CAT score &lt;10), but are at high risk of an exacerbation due to their history of exacerbations in the past year (ie, &ge;2 exacerbations per year with one or more leading to hospitalization), we suggest regular treatment with a LAMA, rather than a LABA, due to the reduced exacerbation rate associated with LAMAs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Alternative choices include a combination of a LAMA plus LABA or a LABA plus an inhaled glucocorticoid. (See <a href=\"#H3255150355\" class=\"local\">'Comparison LAMA and LABA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2008009735\" class=\"local\">'Minimally symptomatic, high risk of exacerbation (Category C)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For category D patients with a higher symptom burden (ie, mMRC grade &ge;2 or CAT score &ge;10) and a high risk of exacerbation (ie, &ge;2 exacerbations per year with one or more leading to hospitalization), we recommend regular treatment with a LAMA-LABA combination, rather than a single long-acting bronchodilator or a LABA-inhaled glucocorticoid combination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients who continue to have symptoms or repeated exacerbations despite LABA-LAMA combined therapy, we recommend triple inhaler therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, a LABA plus inhaled glucocorticoid combination may be preferred if the patient has a clinical presentation or findings that suggest an asthma-COPD overlap. (See <a href=\"#H1171219070\" class=\"local\">'More symptomatic, high risk of exacerbation (Category D)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with GOLD COPD categories B, C and D, we suggest pulmonary rehabilitation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The purpose of pulmonary rehabilitation is to improve symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H3537137238\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary rehabilitation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-rehabilitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary rehabilitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend long-term oxygen therapy in all patients with COPD who have chronic hypoxemia, defined as a resting arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) &le;55 mmHg (7.33 kPa) or pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> )&le;88 percent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with COPD should be advised to quit smoking, educated about COPD, and given yearly influenza vaccination. In addition, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> should be given to all patients with COPD and the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine to those over 65 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103816 \">table 2</a>).
