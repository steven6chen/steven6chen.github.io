Specific definitions can vary widely among countries, as well as among different ethnic and religious groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199045830\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon state and federal estimates, approximately 700,000 to 1.25 million children are abused or neglected annually and nearly 3 million children are placed at risk for harm in the United States. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Approximately 18 percent of cases involve physical abuse. In the United States and developed European countries, the estimated prevalence of physical abuse at any time during childhood ranges from 5 to 16 percent, with as few as 5 percent of all episodes of physical abuse being reported to child protection agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Trends over time in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom suggest that child maltreatment syndrome or assault, physical abuse deaths, and admissions for injuries related to child abuse have not changed significantly since the mid-1970s despite increased child protection activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. While recent government statistics indicate a decrease in the incidence of child abuse in the United States, an increase in both serious injury and death from child abuse has been documented, suggesting the possibility that decreases are due to changing definitions and administrative practices rather than improved recognition and prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Among children younger than 15 years, the World Health Organization estimates that child abuse or neglect accounts for 13 percent of the 1.2 million deaths due to injury worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the United States, up to 2500 children die of inflicted injuries annually with children under 1 year of age affected disproportionately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidence of fatal child abuse may be underreported. As an example, in an observational study of death certificates reviewed by a multidisciplinary child fatality review team, of the children who died as a result of abuse or maltreatment, only half of the certificates included codes that were consistent with child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Certain factors place a child at higher risk for physical child abuse based upon observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Child characteristics:</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Speech and language disorders, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, and non-conduct psychiatric disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promoting-safety-in-children-with-disabilities#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Promoting safety in children with disabilities&quot;, section on 'Maltreatment or neglect'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to thrive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Congenital anomalies, intellectual disability (mental retardation) or other handicaps, or chronic or recurrent illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prematurity and low-birth weight, although the data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unplanned pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unwanted child</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Environment</strong>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unrelated adolescent or adult male in the household</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Domestic or intimate partner violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Animal cruelty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute or chronic family stressors (eg, divorce or interpersonal conflict, illness, or job loss)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Living in poverty </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Social isolation (distant or absent extended family)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Caregiver features</strong>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Young or single parents </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parents with lower levels of education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unrealistic expectations for child; poor knowledge of child development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Negative perception of normal child behaviors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Caregiver was abused or neglected as a child, leading to abuse or neglect of their own children as a learned behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substance or alcohol abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Psychiatric illness (eg, depression, impulse disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p>While these factors clearly contribute to the occurrence of violent acts, and are crucial targets for prevention programs, they must not become the sole foundation for suspecting, evaluating or diagnosing abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H850690392\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abused children returned to an abusive environment without intervention are highly likely to be maltreated again and are at an increased risk for death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. Repeat maltreatment rates are estimated at about 1 in 3. Clinicians may miss many physical abuse injuries at first presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], and, based upon observational studies, can demonstrate significant detection biases based upon the patient's ethnicity or socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/26,27,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,31-35</a>]. Passing from a general state of awareness to concern for a particular patient often requires recognition of a &quot;red flag&quot; for abuse.</p><p>In order to avoid missing such a red flag, the following approach is recommended:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate threats to the child must first be stabilized without concern for issues of child abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a nonspecific condition; such as altered consciousness, vomiting, or pain does not have a clear medical explanation, trauma must be considered in the differential and a search for evidence of trauma incorporated into the assessment plan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When trauma is an active component of the differential diagnosis, a thorough history should probe for the occurrence and details of specific trauma events over a time period that accounts for the duration of symptoms and any reasonable symptom free interval. If there are multiple caretakers, it is best that each caretaker be interviewed separately, so that their histories can be compared.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When trauma is an active component of the differential diagnosis, a thorough physical examination should view and palpate all accessible surfaces of the body. Special attention should be given to the mouth, pinnae of the ears, the scalp, the buttocks and ano-genital region, and body folds such as the neck. (See <a href=\"#H3275964756\" class=\"local\">'Oral injuries'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1593427205\" class=\"local\">'Inflicted bruises'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When injury is identified by the initial assessment, the clinician should assess three issues:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does the injury possess a shape or pattern that indicates an abusive mechanism (loop-of-cord marks, slap marks, bites, immersion burns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109368 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109369\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109369 \">figure 2</a>))?

(See <a href=\"#H706482175\" class=\"local\">'Red flag history'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess the social history. This should include family stressors, drug use, the occurrence of domestic violence, and prior involvement with a children's protective services agency. Often a social work consult is the best way to achieve this goal. (See <a href=\"#H3979318280\" class=\"local\">'Additional factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If evaluation and social history lead to abuse concerns, initiate a full child abuse evaluation.

Consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for evaluation child physical abuse, we recommend careful evaluation for abuse for significantly injured children with any of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No history or denial of trauma despite severe injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implausible history for degree or type of injury (eg, major trauma attributed to a &quot;fall down the stairs&quot; or other short fall such as a fall from a sitting position or an injury mechanism that requires the child to have capability beyond their developmental level [eg, severe scald burns in a 12-month-old attributed to the patient &quot;turning on the hot water faucet&quot;])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained or excessive delay in seeking care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury attributed to in-home resuscitation efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregiver histories that change with retelling or conflict with versions from other observers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe injury explained as self-inflicted or blamed on other young children or pets</p><p/><p>Although uncommon, some cases of physical abuse come to light based upon history from an observer or the victim. For this reason, it is best to interview a verbal child about a suspicious injury without caregivers present whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2568451820\"><span class=\"h2\">Unexplained major trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lack of an explanatory history in a patient with major trauma (eg, subdural hematoma or long bone fractures) is a strong marker for abuse. For example, among 163 children admitted for an acute traumatic intracranial injury, the absence of any explanatory history predicted abuse with 69 percent sensitivity and 97 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of 66 children admitted to two children's hospitals for subdural hematoma, 17 of 39 abused, 4 of 12 indeterminate, and 0 of 15 accidentally injured children had no history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H850690392\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Injuries in children should be well explained by their history in most situations. Infants and young children should be closely supervised by adults. They also lack the independence and motor skills to get into dangerous circumstances without their caregiver's knowledge unless they are being neglected. Thus, with unintentional injuries in these patients, an adult should provide a credible history for any significant injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867485942\"><span class=\"h2\">Implausible mechanism of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two major types of implausible mechanisms that may be provided by perpetrators of child abuse are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inadequate mechanism to explain severity</strong> &ndash; Serious and internal injuries raise concern for abuse when an inadequate mechanism of injury (eg, short fall or fall down the stairs) is provided by the caregiver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Falls are among the commonest causes of early childhood injury. A short fall of &lt;3 feet is also the most commonly given false trauma history accompanying abusive head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among 66 children admitted to two children's hospitals with subdural hematoma, 16 of 39 abused, 5 of 12 indeterminate, and 0 of 15 accidentally injured children had a history of a less than 4-foot fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Determining the likely outcome of such a fall must rely upon confirmable fall events. Trauma events, principally falls, are the most commonly studied examples in hospitals. Six observational studies have described the injuries sustained after falls from cribs or beds in 1174 children ranging from newborn to 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-43</a>]. Of these patients, none sustained symptomatic intracranial injury, though several had a brief period of altered mental status without intracranial bleeding. One long bone fracture occurred in a child with known osteogenesis imperfecta, and one clavicle fracture occurred. There were 10 skull fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Authors have looked at a multitude of special fall scenarios, including bunk beds, stairways, highchairs, or walkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/44-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-54</a>]. As elevation and child ability increases, injury severity increases, though serious intracranial injury remains rare for indoor falls. A literature review explored whether intestinal perforation could be explained by a fall downstairs, and found that none of the 312 cases of intestinal perforation were due to falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Similarly, fatalities from short indoor falls are extremely rare, occurring in perhaps 1 in 2,000,000 children per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As children become more capable and independent, they also become verbal, and may supply their own history. However, in the late toddler and early preschool ages, children may be active and independent enough to injure themselves unintentionally, but lack sufficient communication skills to explain what happened. Minor injuries in these children are expected, and not always explained. Serious and internal injuries, however, still raise concern for abuse when an appropriate mechanism of injury is <strong>not</strong> provided by the caregiver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Developmentally improbable behavior by the child</strong> &ndash; A history that calls for developmentally improbable child behavior (eg, a scald burn in a 9-month-old attributed to the infant &quot;turning on the hot water faucet&quot;) should also be seen as suspicious. Recognition of these false histories requires knowledge of normal developmental milestones and the range of normal motor skills by age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because inflicted burns must be differentiated from injuries caused by the child themselves, young children's ability to climb into a bathtub has been specifically evaluated. Children as young as 10 months old begin to climb into a tub, and, by 15 months of age, 50 percent of children can accomplish this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. By extension, a history of scaling any low barrier, such as a baby gate or a crib rail, must be considered at these ages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The timing of typical developmental milestones is shown in the tables and reviewed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66383 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75336 \">table 4</a>).

However, there is a great deal of overlap for children who are injured <strong>without</strong> an obviously severe mechanism such as a motor vehicle collision. For example, one retrospective study of 121 children admitted to a single center for intraabdominal injury showed that 35 percent of children with low-velocity mechanisms of injury presented for care &gt;12 hours after the injury compared with 54 percent of abused children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In another study of 206 children younger than 6 years of age with accidental extremity fractures, 21 percent were seen more than eight hours after the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Finally, among 105 children receiving care for burns in a pediatric emergency department, treatment delay beyond 24 hours was found in 19 percent of those children ultimately reported to child protection services compared with 6 percent of children who were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Thus, delay in seeking care by itself has a low specificity for abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H706482187\"><span class=\"h2\">Injuries attributed to young children or pets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Siblings are known to injure each other, but serious injury inflicted by a sibling is a rare occurrence in our experience.

As an example, in one series of 105 children evaluated for burns in a pediatric emergency department, 38 percent of children reported to child protection had a history of the sibling causing the burn compared with 6 percent of children for whom a report was not filed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Although not well-described in the literature, our experience suggests that pets are sometimes blamed for severe injuries (eg, &quot;the dog knocked the child over&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H491148344\"><span class=\"h1\">RED FLAG PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any concern for physical abuse should result in a thorough physical examination, with specific attention to the following regions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalp and fontanels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ears </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral cavity, including the buccal mucosa, labial and lingual frenula; the teeth; and the posterior pharyngeal wall </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Folds of the neck </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buttocks </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genitals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palms and soles</p><p/><p>However, not all findings that appear abusive in nature actually result from abuse.

Previously, the age of bruising relative to the timing of injury based upon history was sometimes used to raise suspicion for abuse. However, timing of bruises by physicians and forensic experts based upon color, tenderness, or swelling have poor interrater reliability and low accuracy, especially as bruises age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Similarly, published tables that determine the age of a bruise using its color are inaccurate and misleading and should <strong>not</strong> be used.</p><p>Evidence supporting the increased likelihood of abuse based upon bruising characteristics is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient</strong> <strong>age</strong> &ndash; Any bruising in babies who are not independently mobile is concerning for abuse, especially bruising to the ears, face, neck torso, and buttocks. An isolated bruise may be the only obvious indication of physical abuse. As an example, among children younger than 6 months of age referred for an abuse evaluation for apparently isolated bruising, 50 percent had an additional traumatic injury (fracture, brain injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal injury) identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Among 200 infants younger than 12 months of age who were abused, 27 percent had a past &quot;sentinel&quot; injury, compared with 8 percent of 100 children with intermediate likelihood of abuse and none of the 101 children with no concern for abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Eighty percent of these sentinel injuries were bruises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bruising is uncommon among healthy infants younger than 6 months of age who have not been abused, occurring in approximately 0.5 to 1 percent of patients seen during well care and emergency department visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. This finding contrasts with observed rates of bruising from 18 to almost 50 percent of infants who are cruising or crawling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/63,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,65</a>]. The majority of walking children have bruises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As infants get older, the frequency of bruising rises, even before they learn to pull to a stand and walk with support or &quot;cruise.&quot; A study that followed infants for up to 12 weeks found that approximately 7 percent of pre-mobile children, from birth to 11 months old, had bruises at some point during that period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. During evaluation of infants without a concern for abuse who presented to a pediatric emergency department, about 6 percent of patients 6 months of age and older had bruises compared with approximately 1 percent of infants younger than 6 months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Location and number</strong> &ndash; Bruising to the ear, neck, torso, and buttocks has consistently been found to be more common in abused<strong> </strong>children. In one study of children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, bruising to the torso, ear, or neck in children &lt;4 years old, and any bruising in children &lt;4 months old (TEN-4), had 97 percent sensitivity and 66 percent specificity for abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Specificity increased to 81 percent if children injured in publicly confirmed settings were excluded. The presence of petechial bruising was seen in 15 percent of abused children younger than 6 years but in only 2 percent of unintentionally injured children. Petechial bruising had a likelihood ratio of 8.1 for identifying abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common locations of unintentional bruises include the scalp, knee, shin, or thigh, though other areas, particularly the back, forearms, nose, or cheek, are sometimes injured in mobile children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/63,65,67,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,65,67,74</a>]. Pre-mobile children seldom have more than one bruise, and crawlers and cruisers seldom more than two, but walkers commonly had five or more bruises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The majority of walking children have bruises which are typically multiple.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patterned injuries</strong> &ndash; Objects that deliver a highly concentrated force tear blood vessels in deep tissue. These tend to produce ecchymotic lesions that have blurred margins and a delayed appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These bruises may be a positive image of the impactor, though central clearing is known to occur. Examples are bites, punches, grip marks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52863%7EEM%2F61566\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52863 graphicRef61566 \">picture 2A-B</a>), and most unintentional injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Objects that have a high impact velocity, but diffuse their energy over a broad contact area shear dermal capillaries at their margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. These tend to produce marginal petechiae that form an outline of the impacting object. These lesions often appear very shortly after trauma, initially have sharp margins, and may disappear quite rapidly. Examples include slap marks, belt marks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68419 \">picture 3</a>), loop-of-cord marks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79515\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79515 \">picture 1</a>), switches, spatulas, spoons, hangers, or other objects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109368 \">figure 1</a>). Sometimes these objects will also break the skin, forming superficial lacerations. Patterns are unusual in unintentional injury and provide an objective basis for assessing the truthfulness of an explanatory history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of a bruise with identifiable shape had a likelihood ratio of 25.8 and occurred in fewer than 2 percent of non-abused children in one case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most unintentional bruises are oval, anterior, and over bony prominences. Impacts by an object may leave a bruise that retains the shape of that object (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109368 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bite marks</strong> &ndash; Human bite marks consist of facing semi-lunar rows of box-shaped ecchymosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Dog bites, by contrast, have a long, narrow arch with prominent canines that commonly puncture the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The pattern of tooth imprints can differentiate between adult and child assailants and possibly match a particular assailant. While there is no threshold that perfectly discriminates between a child or adult biter, a maxillary intercanine distance of &gt;30 mm is generally considered to suggest an adult biter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. This determination must be represented cautiously, as research suggests that distinguishing between adult and child bites has limited accuracy, with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.69 for the most experienced examiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Bite marks may also yield saliva and DNA, which can be collected using standard methods of evidence collection, as in cases of acute sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Patterned injury, and particularly bite marks, should be photographed, with a size standard in the photo. The size standard should be at the same distance from the camera as the injury, and the size standard, injury, and camera back should all be in parallel planes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3275964756\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following oral injuries raise concern for abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lip lacerations or bruising, especially in nonambulatory infants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lingual or labial frenulum tears, especially in nonambulatory infants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tongue lacerations, especially in nonambulatory infants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising or wounds of the buccal mucosa, gums, or palate, especially in nonambulatory infants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missing or fracture teeth with an absent or implausible history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maxillary or mandibular fractures with an absent or implausible history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising, lichenification, or scarring at the corners of the mouth from being gagged</p><p/><p>Frenulum tears may occur from accidental injury (as among ambulating toddlers) or from abusive mechanisms, such as force feeding or &quot;bottle jamming&quot;

Other burn characteristics have been used to identify burns from their appearance. The peak age for abusive burning is in the third and fourth years of life and is frequently related to punishment for toilet-training mishaps.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scalds</strong> &ndash; Scalds from hot tap water due to immersion, demonstrating a sharp upper line of demarcation (&quot;high tide mark&quot;), affecting both sides of the body symmetrically, or involving the lower extremities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perineum are more likely to be inflicted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58030 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109270 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78135\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78135 \">picture 6</a>). Inflicted scalds are more likely to occur in children younger than 5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Immersion of a child into a tub of hot water is a particularly recognizable abusive pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. These burns appear complex at first glance, but placing the child in the position they assumed while being burned will produce a planar superior delimitation of the burn, and fold unburned creases below this plane together so that they exclude the burning fluid. Sometimes the most dependent part of the body will be unburned, as it was pressed against the bottom of the tub during burning. Based upon two observational studies, scalds are the most common</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unintentional hot fluid burns commonly occur due to spills. They usually involve the hand, forearm, shoulder, face, and upper chest when a child reaches up and pulls down a cup or pot of hot water or oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Scald injuries are more likely to be abusive when they are posterior, bilateral, and involve the buttocks, lower extremities, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evaluations of tap-water burns are best coordinated with an agency (eg, the regional fire department) that can go to the field, replicate the given history, and measure the temperature of any water at the tap, and within any involved vessel. This permits a given history to be tested. A relationship between exposure time, water temperature, and burn depth was developed for adults and applied to children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. The time needed to produce a partial thickness burn is exponentially and inversely related to temperature. While such burns require contact for several minutes if liquids are &lt;49&deg;C (120&deg;F), burns can occur in seconds if fluids are &gt;66&deg;C (150&deg;F). Circumstances that require a long immersion time, but in which the burn pattern indicates a static sustained contact, would require an unresponsive or immobilized child, also creating concern for abusive injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contact</strong> <strong>burns</strong> &ndash; Burns that have a sharply demarcated edge in the shape of the burning object are more common in abuse than accidental injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109369\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109369 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Examples include spatulas, spoons, grates, metal hair dryer grids, clothes irons, curling irons, and the metal tops of butane cigarette lighters. Among abused children, one-third of these burns were multiple, and two-thirds of multiple burns were on the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children may be burned by heated objects when they move against the object, when the object falls on them, and when they grab the item. As a result, accidental burns usually lack a well-demarcated edge, and affect the palm of the hand or the front of the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Usually these burns only affect one site, but bilateral palm or sole burns have occurred when children walked onto or leaned against hot surfaces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cigarette burns</strong> &ndash; Inflicted cigarette burns are usually discreet circular burns 8 to 12 mm in diameter. Sustained contact or displacement of the ash is necessary to produce a third-degree burn, identifying such burns as deliberately inflicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, with an inadvertent cigarette burn, the lit end of a cigarette, which can be several hundred degrees, is typically insulated with a cooler ash.

Victims of inflicted visceral injury often have other findings of abuse such as head injury, fractures, or cutaneous findings.</p><p>Inflicted abdominal trauma can be caused by direct blows or kicks to the abdomen, or by direct pressure (eg, standing or kneeling on the abdomen) which cause injury or rupture of the hollow organs (eg, duodenal hematoma, traumatic pancreatitis, or bladder rupture) or contusion or laceration of the solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, or kidneys) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Serious abdominal injury after inflicted blunt trauma may be indicated by abdominal tenderness, abdominal distension, enlargement of the liver or spleen, or abdominal wall bruising. However, based upon a systemic review of five observational studies that compared a total of 68 abused children with 488 children injured unintentionally, nonspecific historical features such as vomiting or fussiness may be the only symptoms and few overt signs may be present on physical examination, including lack of cutaneous bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Demographic factors that may guide efforts at prevention are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H1199045830\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>While several studies have shown associations between demographic factors such as race and socioeconomic status and abuse, these associations are <strong>not</strong> useful in the evaluation of an individual patient. Based upon observational studies, clinicians may perform more testing (eg, skeletal surveys) and make more reports to child protection services when evaluating minority children or children with low socioeconomic status when compared with the evaluation of white children or those with higher socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/33-35,101-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35,101-103</a>].</p><p>When medical findings are suggestive of innocent injury, demographic and environmental factors may support intervening to aid the family and lessen risk. When medical findings are suggestive of abuse, even children from low risk groups and privileged backgrounds must be protected.

Twenty-seven percent of maltreatment victims are less than 3 years old, and among fatally abused children, 47 and 81 percent were among children less than 1 year old or less than 4 years old, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Fifty percent of investigated infants younger than 6 months of age with apparently isolated bruising had unexplained internal injuries suggesting abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In children younger than four years of age evaluated at a major children's hospital, the average age of abused traumatized children was 12 months, while that of non-abused children on the trauma registry was 22 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In virtually all studies of abusive head trauma or visceral injury, abused children are significantly younger than their non-abused counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-108</a>]. While this trend holds in all forms of injury, the significance of the child's specific age varies with the injury under consideration. However, as noted in the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, younger age is an important factor when determining the need for an abuse evaluation and reporting to child protection services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1790234144\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior abuse in the household</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior known abuse of a child or sibling should increase the level of concern for abuse. For some patients, obtaining the history of prior abuse requires phone consultation with the primary care provider or the regional child protection services.</p><p>Being on a government child protection registry has a likelihood ratio for abuse of 12.4 for infants and just over 4 for older children presenting to an emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. When physically abused infants known to children's protective service agencies are returned to their families, 30 percent experience second abusive events including repeated physical abuse in 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In 2013, about 12 percent of United States child abuse fatalities were receiving children's protective service agencies services at the time of their death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Among siblings younger than 2 years of age or household contacts of abused, injured children, skeletal survey identified abusive fractures in 12 percent.

Until better formal methods are developed which have acceptable accuracy and can be easily implemented, we favor the broad distribution and use of current guidelines among all pediatric health care providers to enhance general awareness and to support timely recognition of child physical abuse. (See <a href=\"#H3690700216\" class=\"local\">'Society guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>Several researchers have developed and studied standardized methods for detecting injuries that may have been inflicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/111-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">111-113</a>]. Typically these methods have been developed for use in the emergency department, and flag the records of patients with an evaluation tool to be completed by the evaluating clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109272 \">table 8</a>). It has been shown that these tools can increase the rate at which child abuse is considered and detected, improve the documentation of the child abuse assessment, and reduce the impact of social biases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/114-119\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-119</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of a universal child abuse screening tool in multiple emergency departments that saw over 104,000 children during the study, there was a significant increase in the rate of detection of child abuse among screened children when compared to children who were not screened (0.5 versus 0.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. During the study, use of the screening tool increased from 20 to 67 percent. </p><p>However, the low accuracy and difficulty in obtaining consistent use of these instruments in routine practice raise concerns regarding their utility. For example, in a multicenter prospective observational study of a validated child abuse screening tool during over 38,000 child emergency department visits, fewer than half of the patients had the instrument completed and only 420 were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Sensitivity and specificity of the tool was 80 and 98 percent, respectively. Negative predictive value for the screening tool was 99 percent and positive predictive value was 10 percent. A total of 89 patients were referred for a child abuse evaluation and 55 were judged to have been abused (prevalence 0.1 percent). In a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools designed to detect child abuse, sensitivity ranged from 26 to 97 percent and specificity from about 50 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-recognition/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Several of these instruments only detected children when they had clinical symptoms.</p><p>Thus, development of more accurate tools that can be easily implemented in practice is needed before routine screening of ambulatory children for abuse can be recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3690700216\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommendations in the following guidelines may vary from those that appear in this UpToDate topic review.
