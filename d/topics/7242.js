It is performed by an endoscopist, who is a doctor or other health professional with special training in endoscopic procedures. There are several reasons that flexible sigmoidoscopy may be recommended, with one of the most common reasons being the need to screen for colon cancer in people older than 50 years.</p><p>Colonoscopy allows the clinician to examine the entire large intestine and is preferred in certain situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR SIGMOIDOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common reasons for flexible sigmoidoscopy are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a screening test to detect colon polyps or colon cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After radiation treatment to the pelvis when a patient has lower gastrointestinal symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the colon in conjunction with a barium enema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the medical management of colitis (inflammation of the colon)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGMOIDOSCOPY PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A healthcare provider will provide specific Instructions about how to prepare for the examination. The instructions are designed to maximize your safety during and after the examination, minimize complications, and allow the endoscopist to easily view the colon.</p><p>It is important to read these instructions ahead of time and follow them carefully. Call your clinician or the endoscopy unit if you have questions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel cleaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lower part of the colon must be cleaned to permit the endoscopist to see the inside lining of the colon. You will be given specific instructions, with preparation often including a clear liquid diet, laxatives, and use of an enema shortly before the examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medications, such as iron preparations, may need to be stopped one to two weeks before the examination. Iron coats the colon, making it difficult to see the lining. If you take these medications, you should ask your healthcare provider if they need to be stopped before the procedure. People who take a blood thinning medication, such as warfarin (Coumadin), should consult with their clinician regarding the need to stop taking this medication temporarily.</p><p>Most medications for high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, and seizure disorders are safe during sigmoidoscopy and can be taken the day of the examination.</p><p>Medications for diabetes may need to be adjusted before the test; talk to your healthcare provider for advice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT TO EXPECT DURING SIGMOIDOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the sigmoidoscopy, a nurse will ask questions to be sure that you understand the procedure and the reason it is planned. A doctor will review the procedure, including possible complications, and will ask you to sign a consent form.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">The procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible sigmoidoscopy usually takes between 5 and 15 minutes. It is performed while you lie on your left side with your legs bent like they would be if you were sitting in a chair. The sigmoidoscope, which is approximately the size of one finger, is inserted into the anus and advanced through the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58531 \">figure 1</a>). The sigmoidoscope has a camera and a light source that permits the endoscopist to see the inside of the colon on a television monitor.</p><p>The endoscope can be used to take biopsies (small pieces of tissue) and to introduce or withdraw fluid or air. Biopsies do not hurt because the lining of the colon does not sense pain. However, you may feel cramping as air is introduced through the scope and as the scope is passed through segments of the colon. The air is needed to permit the endoscopist to advance the scope and see the lining of the colon.</p><p>It is common to feel embarrassed about releasing air through your rectum, although this is recommended to decrease discomfort. Let the endoscopist know if there is discomfort, since air can also be removed through the scope. Because the procedure is brief and discomfort is mild, pain medications or sedation are not routinely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGMOIDOSCOPY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a safe procedure and complications are rare.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding can occur from biopsies or the removal of polyps, but this is usually minimal and stops quickly or can be controlled.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scope can cause a tear or hole in the tissue being examined. This is a serious problem that does not occur commonly.</p><p/><p>The following symptoms should be reported immediately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe abdominal pain (not just gas cramps)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A firm, distended abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding greater than a few tablespoons</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTER SIGMOIDOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although patients worry about discomforts of the examination, most people tolerate it very well and feel fine afterwards. Most patients are able to return to normal activities, including eating, after the examination. In many cases, you can go to work and drive the same day, provided you did not receive any medications that could interfere with these activities (such as medications used for sedation).</p><p>You should contact your doctor about the results of your test and if you have any questions. The endoscopy team will let you know when all the results will be available and if further treatment is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2008\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
