These include systemic autoimmune disorders, some infectious diseases, and certain ocular processes.</p><p>The clinical features of retinal vasculitis occurring in association with ocular disorders will be reviewed here. Retinal vasculitis due to systemic autoimmune disorders and infectious agents and a classification of the vasculitides are discussed separately.

Retinal vasculitis can also be asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in the retinal vessels may be observed upon physical examination. Funduscopic findings include visible accumulation of inflammatory cells along vessel walls (vascular sheathing) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54347\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54347 \">picture 1</a>). The peripheral vessels are often more involved than central arterioles and venules, and there are frequently skip areas. With certain disorders such as sarcoidosis, lesions resembling candlewax drippings or extensive perivascular inflammation may also be observed.</p><p>The retinal vascular abnormalities are better demonstrated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> angiography. One of the main changes on fluorescein angiography is perivascular staining, which reflects the increase in vascular permeability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66049\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66049 \">picture 2</a>). Cystoid macular edema and capillary nonperfusion also may be seen.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorescein</a> angiography is the gold standard for detecting retinal vasculitis, and it is designed to optimally capture the macular region. However, most retinal vasculitis is typically observed in the peripheral retina, which is not adequately visualized with standard imaging modalities. Ultra-widefield imaging and angiography is available, but has yet to become the standard of care. A study designed to quantify the benefits of wide field imaging versus fluorescein angiography in the management of non-infectious retinal vasculitis included 71 visits from 23 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Based on the clinical examination alone, the decision to alter management was made in 6 percent, and an additional 4 percent of patients using fluorescein angiography. When using ultra-widefield angiography in addition to the clinical examination, management was altered in an additional 14 percent of patients with color images, and 51 percent with ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography. Combining peripheral visualization with the sensitivity of fluorescein angiography for detecting retinal vasculitis should allow for detection of earlier disease and asymptomatic reactivation of disease, resulting in improved patient care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OCULAR SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH RETINAL VASCULITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal vasculitis can occur in association with four primary ocular inflammatory disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic retinal vasculitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pars planitis syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birdshot retinochoroidopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eales' disease (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Eales' disease'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic retinal vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal vasculitis may be the marker for or the harbinger of a systemic disease, usually a systemic inflammatory or immune disorder or an infectious disease, or may occur in isolation or as part of an ocular syndrome such as idiopathic retinal vasculitis aneurysm neuroretinitis (IRVAN). In a study of 150 patients initially diagnosed with isolated retinal vasculitis, 40 percent continued to have local disease at 10-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-systemic-disorders-and-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of progression was substantially lower in a study performed by the National Eye Institute which evaluated 25 patients with primary retinal vasculitis, none of whom had evidence of an underlying causative systemic disorder at disease presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At four-year follow-up, a systemic disease developed in only one patient (4 percent). As a result, if a thorough history, review of systems, and physical examination fail to uncover evidence of a systemic disease at disease presentation, the authors advise that the evaluation should generally be limited to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syphilis and HIV serologies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiograph</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluorescein</a> angiography</p><p/><p>By comparison, a &quot;shotgun&quot; approach to laboratory testing can be expensive and often fruitless.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of idiopathic retinal vasculitis is usually reserved for those who develop poor vision. Systemic glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and plasma exchange have all been used with variable efficacy, but none has been evaluated in a randomized fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. One retrospective study of 29 patients with vision-threatening disease found that the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (initial dose 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) was associated with visual improvement in 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Laser therapy is reserved for complications of retinal vasculitis, such as rubeosis iridis, recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, or retinal neovascularization. Other local procedures are warranted in selected patients. Vitrectomy has been indicated in dense vitreous inflammation, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or epiretinal membrane formation. In some patients, filtering procedures (to increase drainage of aqueous) must be performed to treat the secondary glaucoma that may accompany retinal vasculitis and ocular inflammation. Secondary glaucoma can occur because of inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> new blood vessel growth on the angle (drainage portion of the eye). In patients in whom macular edema develops, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> has been shown to reduce the edema and to improve vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For IRVAN, a single systemic dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranibizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranibizumab</a> appears to be helpful in improving vision and in suppressing complications related to this rare form of retinal vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pars planitis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pars planitis is a common ocular inflammatory condition (also called peripheral uveitis or intermediate uveitis) that is observed in young (typically female) adults and children; it represents one of the most common forms of uveitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although it occurs mostly in isolation and is hence termed idiopathic, a similar condition can be associated with multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]; in one series, the incidence of progression to multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis was 20 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although this rate of conversion is considered to be high based upon clinical experience. The term pars planitis is best reserved for idiopathic disease unrelated to systemic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major clinical findings of pars planitis are localized to the vitreous and posterior pole. One eye is usually affected more than the other, and the condition is bilateral in 80 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The hallmark of the disorder is the presence of preretinal exudates over the inferior pars plana, findings referred to as snow banks. Patchy, peripheral retinal vasculitis often accompanies these lesions. In addition, the vitreous cavity usually has cells, debris, and snowball opacities.</p><p>The two major causes of visual loss in pars planitis are macular edema and vitreous opacities. Cataracts are the most common complication and may result from inflammation and glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy consists of oral or <span class=\"nowrap\">intra/periocular</span> injected glucocorticoids. External cryotherapy has also been used directly on the snowbanks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If these modalities fail, systemic immunosuppression, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, has been used in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/6,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,18</a>]. Severe disease can often benefit from surgery to extract a cataract <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to remove vitreous debris.</p><p>Decisions regarding the best modality and dose of therapy should be made in conjunction with an ophthalmologist expert in this area; as a general rule, immunosuppressive dosing is similar to that used in systemic vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Birdshot retinochoroidopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Birdshot retinochoroidopathy is a rare ocular condition characterized by multiple discrete, cream-colored foci of depigmentation scattered throughout the fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70729\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70729 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Involvement of the anterior segment is uncommon, although occasional cells and flares may be detected. There is usually cellular infiltration in the vitreous cavity. The diagnostic hallmark is the presence of vitreous cells, choroidal spots, and the absence of snowbanks or peripheral vascular change.</p><p>Retinal vasculitis is also a common finding. In a study of 203 eyes with birdshot retinochoroidopathy, 40 percent had perivascular leakage and 62 percent had cystoid macular edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76872\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76872 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Birdshot retinochoroidopathy is strongly associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A29 haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because of this major histocompatibility (MHC) association and its unique clinical features, it is possible to distinguish this disorder from other retinal vasculitides without a systemic workup.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of birdshot retinochoroidopathy is not uniformly successful; frequently, a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and a third immunosuppressive agent is required for an optimal response. One study found that treatment regimens initially including low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> were more effective than treatment primarily with systemic glucocorticoid or without any systemic immunomodulatory therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The use of a sustained release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinolone</a> implant has also shown promise; although ocular complications could be considerable, this method avoids systemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Eales' disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eales' disease is a retinal vasculopathy of the peripheral retina.

Although the disease is typically unilateral at onset, 80 to 90 percent eventually develop bilateral disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eales-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eales' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Retinal vasculitis is the primary ocular manifestation of this condition. It is thought to affect retinal veins predominantly, but arteriolar involvement may also occur. Peripheral nonperfusion is commonly observed, and branch retinal vein occlusions may develop.
