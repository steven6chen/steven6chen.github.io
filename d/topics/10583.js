Management varies with the age of the patient and includes therapy for the short stature and estrogen deficiency, as well as identifying and managing the associated congenital anomalies and related complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60006 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cases of Turner syndrome are sometimes discovered incidentally during chorionic-villus sampling or amniocentesis performed for unrelated reasons, such as advanced maternal age or for suspicion about congenital anomalies noted on fetal ultrasonography. Ultrasonography may show increased nuchal translucency, which is a good marker for fetal chromosomal defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, if a fetus with hydrops or a large cystic hygroma is found to have a 45,X karyotype, the diagnosis of Turner syndrome can be made with a high degree of certainty. The chance for spontaneous abortion will also be quite high.</p><p>The parents should receive detailed genetic counseling. Parents sometimes consider elective termination of the pregnancy, often prompted by their review of information that is available on the internet. However, prenatal counseling is challenging because it is difficult to predict the phenotype of girls with incidentally diagnosed Turner syndrome. Retrospective studies suggest that these girls, and particularly those with <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX</span> mosaicism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], may have a milder phenotype than those diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], but more prospective studies confirming these results are necessary. It is important that some of the counseling be provided by health care professionals with direct experience caring for Turner syndrome patients throughout childhood and adolescence; these are often pediatric endocrinologists. Such clinicians are best suited to answer questions about available treatments and prognosis related to the Turner syndrome comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;, section on 'Turner syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INFANTS AND CHILDREN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2851216749\"><span class=\"h2\">Disclosure of diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients report that their Turner syndrome diagnosis or other important information was inappropriately withheld from them. In a study conducted in the United States, approximately one-third of patients with Turner syndrome reported that their families or health care providers had withheld all or part of the Turner syndrome diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, several patients were not informed of the infertility associated with the diagnosis. How the diagnosis is shared with the patients may result in a negative disclosure experience. We encourage helping parents disclose diagnostic and other health-related information in a timely, caring, and age-appropriate manner. This is of great importance to the overall mental and physical health of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1934618819\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring and managing comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive initial evaluation and subsequent monitoring are recommended for each of the following issues, as outlined in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106468%7EENDO%2F106469%7EENDO%2F106470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106468 graphicRef106469 graphicRef106470 \">table 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An approach to screening for cardiovascular anomalies recommended by a consensus group is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106468 \">table 2A</a>). At the time of diagnosis, all infants and children with Turner syndrome should have a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation by a cardiologist, including echocardiography to evaluate for structural abnormalities and electrocardiography (ECG) to assess for conduction abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The comprehensive examination should include measurements of blood pressure in all extremities. Magnetic resonance <span class=\"nowrap\">imaging/angiography</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(MRI/MRA)</span> is recommended in older girls and women (at least after the patient does not require sedation for this procedure anymore). These imaging studies are done to detect cardiovascular anomalies such as coarctation of the aorta or a bicuspid aortic valve. Other cardiovascular anomalies in Turner syndrome are reviewed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60006 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, all patients with Turner syndrome, and especially those with identified cardiac anomalies, should have ongoing follow-up care with a cardiologist and, if possible, one who has expertise in congenital heart disease. Management and follow-up depends on the baseline findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls found to have coarctation of the aorta should almost always undergo surgical correction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls with other anomalies should be followed regularly. Those who have only had echocardiography should undergo a cardiac MRI when they are old enough to tolerate the procedure without requiring sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat imaging is suggested approximately every 5 to 10 years, at the time of transition from pediatric to adult care, before attempting pregnancy, or with the appearance of hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not required for most Turner syndrome patients with valvular heart disease, including those with bicuspid aortic valve. This is based on the 2007 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on the prevention of bacterial endocarditis, which recommends that only patients with the highest risk of the development of endocarditis receive antimicrobial prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3371552569\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is common in Turner syndrome, although little has been documented about the diagnosis of hypertension in this population. A prevalence as high as 30 percent in children and 60 percent in adults has been suggested. Blood pressure should therefore be monitored regularly. It is important to measure blood pressure manually because automatic blood pressure monitoring often results in falsely high readings. Turner syndrome patients are more likely to have transiently elevated blood pressure measurements in the office (&quot;white coat hypertension&quot;) due to their increased level of anxiety compared with normal peers. If hypertension develops, it should be treated vigorously.</p><p>There is limited evidence to inform the choice of blood pressure targets or antihypertensives. Most experts suggest starting therapy for blood pressures that are persistently in the hypertensive range and targeting a low-normal blood pressure range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hypertension is defined as blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;130/80</span> mmHg for adults and children &gt;13 years, or &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for younger children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Most start therapy with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, unless otherwise contraindicated, due to their favorable effect on aortic dilatation in Marfan syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a reasonable alternative.

Patients may have attention deficit disorder and difficulties with visual-spatial organization, social cognition, and nonverbal problem-solving tasks such as mathematics. Neuropsychological and educational testing is recommended before enrollment in preschool or kindergarten programs to assess intellectual skills, learning skills, motor skills, and social maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

If structural abnormalities are identified, patients should be monitored clinically for urinary tract infection. The presence of an abnormality of the collecting system increases the risk for urinary tract infections, although most patients do not have any long-term issues with recurrent infections.

Lymphedema of the hands and feet that is present at birth usually remits substantially but not always completely. When present in the lower legs and feet in children or adults, it can be controlled in most cases with support stockings, lymphatic drainage massage therapy, and physical therapy. Vascular surgery aimed at the correction of the lymphedema is rarely indicated. Use of diuretics does not help and is not warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of short stature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short stature, sometimes combined with a stocky appearance is the most common clinical feature of Turner syndrome. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Recombinant human growth hormone</a> therapy starting in early childhood is recommended to maximize adult height. For monitoring growth, the height of patients with Turner syndrome should be plotted on growth curves specific for this disorder. These growth curves show height percentiles for untreated patients with Turner syndrome, as well as height percentiles for the general female population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75558 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Note that growth hormone secretion testing is <strong>not</strong> indicated, because patients with Turner syndrome do not have growth hormone deficiency despite their short stature. Nonetheless, growth hormone therapy in pharmacologic doses improves growth.</p><p>For selected patients, height outcomes can be further improved by adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a>, an anabolic steroid, to growth hormone therapy, as described in the following section. (See <a href=\"#H7637360\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone therapy plus oxandrolone'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth hormone therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Recombinant human growth hormone</a> therapy should be initiated as soon as the height of a girl with Turner syndrome falls below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for age on the normal female growth chart, which usually occurs between two and five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. Young patients with particularly slow growth velocity may benefit from starting growth hormone even earlier (ie, before the height falls below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile); further studies on growth hormone in toddlers are in progress, as outlined below. A typical initial dose of growth hormone is approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day</span> (0.375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/week),</span> given once daily by subcutaneous injection. Patients with Turner syndrome are typically treated with somewhat higher doses of growth hormone compared with patients with growth hormone deficiency; doses of growth hormone up to 67 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day</span> have been used in the United States. Growth hormone therapy should be continued until little growth potential remains (eg, bone age exceeds 13.5 to 14 years and growth slows to less than 2.5 cm per year). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The dosing of growth hormone is most commonly based on body weight. Because girls with Turner syndrome are frequently overweight, the growth hormone dose can become relatively excessive. To avoid this problem, we measure serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and adjust the growth hormone dose as needed to maintain IGF-1 levels slightly above the mean (approximately 1 standard deviation [SD] above the mean for age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Tanner stage of pubertal development). This is because a high IGF-1 (eg, &gt;+2 SD) may be associated with toxicity, while a low IGF-1 suggests that the dose of growth hormone is insufficient and may not achieve an optimal growth response. IGF-1-based dose titration of growth hormone therapy is extrapolated from management of children with other growth disorders, such as idiopathic short stature or growth hormone deficiency, and the efficacy of this technique for Turner syndrome has not been established. Alternatively, growth hormone dosing in Turner syndrome patients can be calculated based on body surface area (using 1.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/M<sup>2</sup>/day</span> as a starting point). This approach may be most appropriate for the Turner syndrome patients beyond 9 to 10 years of age, when they are more likely to be overweight and, therefore, body weight-based dosing is more likely to lead to overdosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Initiation of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">recombinant human growth hormone</a> at a young age often permits attainment of normal adult height.

In the group treated with growth hormone, mean height&plusmn;SD increased from -1.4&plusmn;1.0 prior to treatment to -0.3&plusmn;1.1 after two years, representing a +1.1 SD gain. In the control group, mean height&plusmn;SD decreased from -1.8&plusmn;1.1 at the beginning of the study to -2.2&plusmn;1.2 two years later, representing a -0.5 SD decline. The between-group difference at the end of the study was 1.6&plusmn;0.6 SD (p &lt;0.0001). This study confirmed that early growth hormone treatment can correct growth failure and normalize height in infants and toddlers with Turner syndrome. The effects of this approach on adult height have not been reported at this time.</p><p/><p>Together, the findings from these studies demonstrate that early initiation of growth hormone therapy is important to achieve clinically significant increments in height and that higher doses (eg, above 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg</span> per day) yield additional benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. We do not recommend the routine use of very low-dose estrogen in prepubertal children (ie, before approximately 11 years of age), because its effects on height are modest (an additional 2.1 cm), and this may be insufficient to justify its use. It is possible that such very low-dose estrogen therapy may also improve bone mineralization and memory and cognitive function, but these outcomes require further investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3802947085\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of hormonal therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to its effect on longitudinal bone growth, growth hormone therapy may have beneficial effects on body composition. In a cross-sectional study of girls with Turner syndrome, growth hormone therapy increased lean body mass and decreased body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These changes were independent of estrogen exposure. Growth hormone therapy does not appear to have a deleterious effect on blood pressure, left ventricular function, or aortic diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Adverse effects of growth hormone therapy, including intracranial hypertension, slipped capital femoral epiphyses, and pancreatitis, are uncommon, similar to those seen in children who are treated with growth hormone for indications other than Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Higher doses of oxandrolone should not be used, because they may result in virilization and may accelerate skeletal maturation. Oxandrolone treatment is continued until estrogen therapy is begun, around 11 or 12 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If delayed pubertal induction is chosen, monotherapy with growth hormone is continued, and estrogens are started around 14 years rather than the more typical time point of 11 to 12 years of age. This results in delayed induction of puberty and permits additional growth before epiphyseal fusion.</p><p/><p>Either of these approaches results in a similar degree of improvement in adult height. This was shown in a trial in which 106 girls with Turner syndrome were randomized to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a> (0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> maximum 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo beginning at nine years of age, in addition to standard growth hormone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Those with evidence of ovarian failure at 12 years of age were further randomized to ethinyl estradiol to induce puberty at 12 versus 14 years (the latter group, the &quot;delayed pubertal induction&quot; group, received placebo from age 12 to 14 years). Both oxandrolone and delayed pubertal induction increased adult height: oxandrolone by an average of 4.6 cm (95% CI 1.9-7.2 cm) and delayed pubertal induction by an average of 3.8 cm (95% CI 0-7.5 cm). In those who completed both randomizations, the improvement in adult height with oxandrolone, delayed pubertal induction, or both was similar (approximately 7 cm). Thus, both interventions had a beneficial effect on adult height but were not additive.</p><p>The combination of growth hormone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a> had similar beneficial effects in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], including a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Further study is needed to evaluate which girls with Turner syndrome would benefit most from combination therapy with growth hormone and oxandrolone and to determine the optimal duration of this treatment. Limited evidence suggests the possibility that oxandrolone therapy may enhance some aspects of cognitive function, but the data are insufficient to inform clinical practice.

Because of the broad range of gonadal dysfunction, it can be difficult to predict which girls will have absence of puberty and which will have spontaneous thelarche or even menarche. However, serum anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) concentrations appear to be useful for predicting future ovarian function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Ovarian failure'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we usually initiate estrogen replacement therapy if there is no evidence of breast development by 11 to 12 years of age. In addition, to assess the likelihood of pending ovarian failure (and resulting absence of normal puberty), we measure serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and AMH, around 10 or 11 years of age, to help estimate ovarian function and predict the need for estrogen replacement. AMH is a reasonably sensitive marker of prepubertal follicular development and can be used to assess ovarian function throughout childhood. In one study, serum AMH is detectable in 22 percent of all Turner syndrome patients (10 percent in 45,X versus 77 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XX),</span> and those with detectable concentrations of AMH were more likely to experience spontaneous puberty (odds ratio [OR] 19.3) and menarche (OR 47.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Measurement of FSH or luteinizing hormone (LH) has less utility than AMH in predicting gonadal function in girls with Turner syndrome. In most girls with ovarian failure over the age of 10 years, FSH will be elevated (into the menopausal range) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the past, measurements of FSH (and to a lesser extent, LH), were used to try to predict gonadal dysfunction in children with Turner syndrome. Although prepubertal girls with Turner syndrome tend to have higher FSH values than healthy girls, there is considerable overlap, especially because FSH varies with age in healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2551796585\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultimately, almost all girls with Turner syndrome need exogenous estrogen. This includes the 15 to 30 percent of girls with Turner syndrome who experience spontaneous puberty, which may persist for some time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Beginning treatment with low-dose estradiol around 11 to 12 years of age permits a normal timing and pace of puberty without compromising adult height. Some investigators suggest estrogen at an earlier age, at a very low dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. However, the potential benefits and risks of this approach have not been sufficiently established to warrant routine use. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxandrolone</a> was used in conjunction with growth hormone, it should be discontinued when estrogen treatment is started. Growth hormone and estrogen may be given together until epiphyseal fusion occurs, after which the growth hormone is stopped.</p><p>Estrogen replacement is usually begun at doses between one-tenth to one-eighth of the adult replacement dose and then increased gradually during the next two to four years, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62742 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial dose of estrogen should be low, eg, a transdermal estradiol patch at 3.125 to 6.25 micrograms daily (or even just applied overnight, to deliver approximately one-half this dose); depot estradiol at 0.2 to 0.4 mg monthly; or micronized estradiol at 0.25 mg daily by mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When using transdermal estradiol patches, the lowest doses are achieved by cutting a matrix estrogen patch accordingly; the cutting technique cannot be used for a reservoir-type patch, as this would make the entire dose available at once.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose should be increased gradually during the following two years to a young adult dose. A typical adult dose is a transdermal estradiol patch (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/day),</span> applied weekly or twice weekly. The dose should be adjusted to maintain the serum estradiol concentration within the normal range. This dose is also roughly equivalent to 2 mg of oral micronized estradiol, approximately 10 to 20 mcg of oral ethinyl estradiol, or 1.25 mg of oral conjugated equine estrogen. Clinicians treating adult Turner syndrome patients can interchange between these formulations, but the transdermal route is preferred, as discussed in the following section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>The rationale for the gradual increase in estrogen dose is to mimic normal puberty and breast development. Although there are no available clinical data, many clinicians feel that this approach results in more normal breast development than when high doses are initiated. However, some girls do not think that their breast development is optimal even after appropriate estrogen therapy. This is hard to prove but could be due to poor development of breast anlage, widely spaced nipples, and the shield chest. We do not adjust the estrogen dose based upon the degree of breast development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2540613036\"><span class=\"h4\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best choice at this time is to use transdermal estradiol (rather than oral micronized estradiol or conjugated estrogens), if the patient is willing and able to use this dose form. The transdermal estradiol is administered via a patch, which can be cut to deliver a reduced dose for young patients, as outlined above. Potential advantages of transdermal administration compared with oral estrogens include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More physiologic delivery, ie, into the systemic, rather than the hepatic, circulation.

The benefits of use of transdermal estrogen preparations should be balanced against the potential for poorer treatment adherence compared with oral estrogens.</p><p>We generally avoid conjugated estrogens, if possible, given the advantages of the other preparations. Many adult patients with Turner syndrome prefer combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives for hormone replacement, and, for some patients, the added convenience may improve treatment adherence. In this case, improved adherence to combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives may outweigh their additional risks compared with transdermal estrogens.

Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, and patients should undergo a full cardiac examination by a specialist, with additional imaging studies (both echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to monitor valvular disease and to detect aortic root dilatation or other cardiovascular anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-turner-syndrome/abstract/7,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,63-65</a>].

To minimize this risk, close cardiovascular monitoring is required in patients with a dilated ascending aorta (aortic size index &gt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. Approaches to managing the patient with aortic dilatation may include beta blockers, exercise restriction, and aggressive blood pressure control, similar to management of this issue in patients with Marfan syndrome. Any complaint of chest pain should be evaluated urgently by a specialist because it may be a symptom of early dissection.

Sensorineural hearing impairment, predominantly at a frequency of 1000 to 2000 Hz (sensorineural dip), has been noted in more than 50 percent of adult Turner syndrome patients. This sensorineural hearing loss may be superimposed on conductive loss due to frequent otitis media in childhood and may also be complicated by the development of cholesteatoma in some patients.

Important preventive measures include optimal estrogen replacement and counseling to ensure recommended intake of calcium and vitamin D and weight-bearing exercise. Women who meet these goals typically have normal bone mineral density (BMD).

However, there are cardiovascular risks during and after pregnancy, the most important of which is the risk of aortic dissection. Cardiovascular evaluation is essential before considering pregnancy.
