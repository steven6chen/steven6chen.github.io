The most common reason for maternal transfer is availability of neonatal tertiary care; transferring the undelivered woman is preferable to neonatal transport and should be a primary goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Maternal transfers are also performed for maternal medical or surgical conditions, to accommodate family request, to comply with insurance contract requirements, or when a pregnant woman seeks emergency care at a facility without obstetrical services. </p><p>Although most hospitals are not expected to provide obstetric units or tertiary neonatal care, they should be prepared to stabilize obstetric patients who present for emergency care or who have complicated pregnancies. This preparation includes having a prearranged transfer agreement that identifies the preferred receiving obstetric care facility, mode of transport, and method of clinician-to-clinician contact. Transport may occur by ground (ambulance), helicopter, or fixed wing plane. An obvious concern is the possibility of delivery during transport, when minimal resources are available. </p><p>A general guide for inter-facility patient transfer has been published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and is available through their website (<a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/ems/interfacility/index.htm&amp;token=nh4rWmONxWU/RHa+yRGCYcQUfVJdzVO3ADbmqRElRIBFpq+s4ZW7pAkU/VcHHs5XYFE9/LLlgZfmvxhiYIbYCFexo5eTF+WguMKW7d5QBUU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=17178\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/ems/interfacility/index.htm</a>). However, this guide does not specifically address pregnant patients. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada has published a Maternal Transport Policy Statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25870676\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, only 1.4 percent of all births are very low birthweight babies (VLBW, &lt;1500 g); however, a large proportion (51 percent) of neonatal mortality occurs in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In part for this reason, the March of Dimes published a document entitled &quot;Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy,&quot; which stimulated the development of regionalized perinatal care systems and maternal transport programs. One of the primary purposes of regionalization was to clearly define the scope of neonatal care available at hospitals and increase the number of high-risk and premature births occurring at appropriate level facilities rather than transferring neonates to these facilities after birth. The benefit of this approach was subsequently illustrated by a meta-analysis that evaluated neonatal outcomes for VLBW or very preterm babies and found neonatal mortality significantly increased if delivery occurred outside of highly specialized (level III) hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the United States, 74 percent of VLBW deliveries between 2000 and 2008 occurred in high-risk facilities, but with wide variation among the states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Oregon had the highest rate of inborn VLBW neonates at 99.4 percent, compared with 32 percent in Mississippi. Only five states (Oregon, Nevada, Iowa, Rhode Island and Vermont) exceeded 90 percent. </p><p>Although most maternal transports go to a facility with a well-defined level of neonatal care and for neonatal indications, some maternal transfers are for maternal indications. A national effort to standardize maternal levels of care has been initiated in an effort to improve maternal morbidity and mortality and decrease &quot;near-misses&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In 2015, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine issued a joint care consensus document on levels of maternal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This guideline is intended to develop standards for designations of maternal care that are complimentary to, but distinct from, neonatal levels of care. The authors propose a framework for levels of maternal care from birth centers, basic care (level I), specialty care (level II), subspecialty care (level III) and regional perinatal healthcare centers (level IV). According to the consensus document, &quot;Each facility should have a clear understanding of its capability to handle increasingly complex levels of maternal care, and should have a well-defined threshold for transferring women to health care facilities that offer a higher level of care. To ensure optimal care of all pregnant women, all birth centers, hospitals, and higher-level facilities should collaborate to develop and maintain maternal and neonatal transport plans and cooperative agreements capable of managing the health care needs of women who develop complications; receiving hospitals should openly accept transfers.&quot; Subsequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the voluntary Levels of Care Assessment Tool (CDC LOCATe). As of August 2017, 12 states (California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming) and Puerto Rico are participating in CDC LOCATe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This process is intended to create standards for assessing maternal and neonatal levels of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25870888\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21515544\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) was enacted in 1986 to govern the transfer of unstable patients. It applies to all patients treated at facilities in the United States that accept payments from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The intent is to ensure that all patients receive a medical screening examination to evaluate for an emergent medical condition, which must be treated regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Under the statute, a pregnant woman who presents in active labor must be admitted and treated through delivery, unless an indication for transfer exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>EMTALA guidelines require the following of hospitals with an emergency department:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide a medical screening examination to any individual who comes to the emergency department</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide necessary stabilizing treatment to any individual with an emergency medical condition or in labor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide for appropriate transfer at patient request or if the facility does not have capability or capacity to provide necessary treatment to stabilize the emergency medical condition.

CAMTS has developed accreditation standards with measurable criteria for medical transport that are designed to address issues of patient care and safety. Accreditation is granted after completion of an application process and a site visit to evaluate &quot;substantial compliance&quot; with the accreditation standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The CAMTS accreditation process addresses multiple general criteria for certification, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mission statement and scope of care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotorwing standards</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fixed wing standards</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surface vehicle standards</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical escort standards</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21515558\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATION FOR MATERNAL TRANSFER</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25870941\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transport of a pregnant patient from her present facility to another facility should be considered when the present facility does not have sufficient resources for maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal care.

Both should have an understanding of, and operate within, all applicable local and state regulations, in addition to the federal statutes.</p><p>Key components to the successful transport of a patient at risk for delivery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good communication between the referring facility, transport team, and receiving facility. Written documentation or, ideally, recorded conversation with typed transcript.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timely <span class=\"nowrap\">response/arrival</span> by the transport team </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experienced and trained transport personnel to assess patient status and determine appropriateness of transport</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to provide a rapid mode of transport to the receiving facility</p><p/><p>Providers at the transferring facility should initiate treatment and stabilization efforts prior to transport. At a minimum, this should include assessment of maternal vital signs, fetal condition, fetal position, and cervical examination if the patient is contracting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All patients should have intravenous access with at least an 18-gauge catheter and should not be allowed oral intake. Foley catheter placement should be considered, depending on the patient condition and anticipated duration of transport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25870969\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining patient stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step before initiating transfer is to determine whether the mother and fetus are stable. According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) statute, stability for transfer is determined by the physician or qualified medical provider evaluating the patient. Stability is a judgment that the patient's condition is not expected to deteriorate substantially during the transfer process.</p><p>According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a qualified medical provider may sign the certification that benefits of transfer outweigh the risks, in consultation with a physician, if the responsible physician is not physically present at time of transfer. Hospitals have the ability to designate non-physician medical providers to act as a qualified medical provider and provide medical screening examinations. If non-physicians will be screening patients, the hospital must indicate in their bylaws which non-physicians can perform this service; the written statute is not specific regarding whether the non-physician is a registered nurse, nurse practitioner, or certified nurse midwife. A clear process for phone consultation between the physician and non-physician provider and guidelines for when the physician must come in to assess the patient before transfer should be established. When a non-physician certifies the transfer, hospital bylaws should provide a means for physician signature to certify the transfer after the fact.</p><p>In the event the patient is unstable (ie, in active labor), the transferring physician must document that the benefits of transfer to another facility outweigh the risks for the mother <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the fetus.</p><p>Although delivery of the obstetric patient during transport is a significant concern, the available data suggest that delivery en route is a rare event. In one large study, 1080 obstetric transports for preterm labor were performed in nulliparous and multiparous patients during a 21-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fifty-four patients were &gt;7 cm dilation at the time of the call for transport, and 25 of the 54 were fully dilated; station ranged from -2 (12 patients) to +2 (10 patients). A trained flight nurse evaluated each patient at the referring facility to determine safety of transport, and decided not to transport 5 of the 54 patients. Of the remaining 49 patients, 40 were transported by helicopter with a mean transport time of 15 minutes, 8 were transported by fixed wing transport with a mean travel time of 90 minutes, and 1 was transported by ground ambulance with a transport time of 27 minutes. No patient delivered en route, but 32 (59 percent) delivered within 0 to 120 minutes of arrival at the receiving hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25870977\"><span class=\"h2\">Records and documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Written informed consent should be obtained and a copy of the patient's medical records (eg, antenatal record, pertinent hospital records and ultrasound reports) should accompany the patient. Reports that are unavailable at the time of transport can be faxed when available. Completion of a transfer form that includes key information about the patient, the indication for transport, and mode of transport selected is also recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25870992\"><span class=\"h2\">Communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Written patient care guidelines and ongoing communication between providers at each facility are important to facilitate safe transfer. Once the decision to transfer has been made, the transferring facility (physician or provider performing the medical screening examination) should contact the receiving facility. Key points the transferring provider should communicate include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/obstetrical</span> history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indication for transfer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stability of patient (ie, vital signs, cervical exam, and fetal heart rate interpretation) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intended mode of transport</p><p/><p>The receiving facility should clearly communicate its willingness to accept the patient in transport. After the patient has been transferred, the receiving facility should provide follow-up on the patient, as well as a written discharge summary with recommendations for outpatient care upon discharge. The process for communicating this information to the transferring <span class=\"nowrap\">facility/provider</span> and the person responsible for this communication (eg, receiving physician) should be clearly defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25871007\"><span class=\"h2\">Responsibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The referring physician and hospital have continuing responsibility for the patient until the patient arrives at the receiving facility, unless the receiving facility is sending the transport team. In that instance, the receiving facility assumes responsibility for the patient once she leaves the transferring hospital. </p><p>Most transport teams do not include a physician. If the transport team is not able to manage the medical issues in transport with phone consultation, then stability for transport should be reconsidered. However, in some circumstances, an unstable patient must be transferred to another facility and may necessitate physician presence. For example, a postpartum patient may require emergency neurologic care for an intracranial hemorrhage that occurred at a facility unable to provide those services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21515579\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment and supplies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Equipment needed for transport will depend on the type of transport, patient acuity, the type of vehicle utilized, and the distance of the transfer. The minimum general equipment required should be that needed to assess maternal vital signs, perform resuscitation if indicated, including acute airway management, availability of portable oxygen tanks and necessary equipment for their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

modes of transport, patient acuity, weather, distance, time, ground conditions, and cost. Utilizing fixed wing and helicopter transport obviously requires additional resources, particularly take-off and landing sites. Fixed wing (or in some cases, helicopter) transport also involves additional transfer of the patient by ground ambulance from the landing site to the hospital facility.</p><p>Limited observational data are available regarding advantages and disadvantages of various transport modes for obstetric patients. Air medical transport of pregnant women by helicopter or fixed wing plane appears to be safe and associated with a very low risk of in-flight complication(s), including delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Helicopter transport offers some advantages compared to surface vehicle transport, particularly when the distance to the receiving facility is relatively long or in urban areas where traffic congestion prevents rapid transit. In these situations, some patients not felt to be stable for surface vehicle transport may be candidates for more rapid transfer by helicopter. Helicopter transport costs can be competitive with ground transport costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21515593\"><span class=\"h2\">Transport team personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Composition of the maternal transport team has not been standardized nationally. Team composition is somewhat limited by the physical capacity of the transport vehicle; therefore, the team members should have advanced skill sets and experience.</p><p>A Maternal Transport Program funded and administered through the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) provides a good example of the composition and training of a maternal transport team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Maternal vital signs should be obtained and recorded every 15 minutes, or more frequently, as dictated by the patient's condition. The frequency of uterine contractions should be noted and documented. The patient should be transported in a left lateral decubitus or sitting position to minimize aortocaval compression from the uterus. </p><p>Patients may develop nausea or anxiety related to the transport. Supportive care should be provided. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ondansetron</a> 4 to 8 mg intravenously (IV) will provide antiemetic relief; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a> 25 to 50 mg IV offers the advantage of a sedative effect (if desired) in addition to the antiemetic effect. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> 1 to 2 mg IV may be used alone or in combination with an antiemetic for patients with more significant anxiety issues.</p><p>The ability to perform en route continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring can be limited by available space for the monitor, early gestational age, and turbulence or movement from the transport process. Intermittent documentation of fetal heart tones by Doppler should be performed if continuous fetal monitoring cannot be accomplished, and is an acceptable alternative (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fetal heart rate assessment&quot;, section on 'Equipment'</a>). Possible interventions if a nonreassuring fetal heart rate is identified en route include repositioning the patient, increasing intravenous fluid administration, and administering supplemental oxygen or tocolytic drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited data exist regarding fetal monitoring during maternal transport. In the only study on the feasibility of continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring during maternal fixed wing transport, 40 of the 57 transports (70 percent) were electronically monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inter-facility-maternal-transport/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The other 17 patients could not be monitored electronically because of obesity, no electronic monitor available, unable to convert monitor for use with an airplane battery, or &quot;unknown&quot; reasons; the fetal heart rate of these patients was intermittently monitored with a Doppler device. Thirty-three of the 40 electronic fetal heart rate tracings (83 percent) were clear and readable at least 50 percent of the time en route. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21515600\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNOPSIS OF MANAGEMENT IN SELECTED CLINICAL SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following outlines provide a synopsis of our approach to maternal assessment and preparation for transfer in some common clinical settings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29994719\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm labor</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain maternal vital signs and assess fetal status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a vaginal exam if intact membranes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determine fetal presentation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test for fetal fibronectin (fFN) if clinically indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-preterm-labor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of preterm labor&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia if clinically indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters#H21417087\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Second and third trimesters&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted disease'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check urinalysis (sterile catheterized specimen preferred)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain Group B Streptococcus (GBS) culture and initiate GBS prophylaxis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> for fetal neuroprotection if clinically indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroprotective-effects-of-in-utero-exposure-to-magnesium-sulfate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroprotective effects of in utero exposure to magnesium sulfate&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer tocolysis if clinically indicated because of labor, particularly preterm labor (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhibition of acute preterm labor&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> 12 mg intramuscular (IM) prior to transport if clinically indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29994726\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm premature rupture of membranes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain maternal vital signs and assess fetal status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform sterile speculum exam for pooling and microscopic exam for ferning.
