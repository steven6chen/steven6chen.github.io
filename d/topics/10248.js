[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Substantial progress has been made in developing immunosuppressive regimens to prevent acute and chronic rejection, while trying to reduce the side effects of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, despite improvements in immunosuppressive therapy, acute and chronic transplant rejection remain important obstacles to successful lung transplantation.</p><p>The protocols for immunosuppressive therapy following lung transplantation can be divided into three general categories: induction, maintenance, and treatment of rejection. Strategies for maintenance of immunosuppression in the lung transplant recipient will be reviewed here. The role of induction agents in immunosuppression, general issues related to lung transplantation, the immunology of sold organ transplantation, and the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic lung transplant rejection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppression following lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32760008\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three general principles underlie immunosuppressive therapy following lung transplantation: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first principle is that immune reactivity and the tendency toward graft rejection are highest early (within the first three to six months) after graft implantation and decrease with time. Thus, most regimens employ the highest intensity of immunosuppression immediately after surgery and decrease the intensity of therapy over the first year, eventually settling on the lowest maintenance levels of immunosuppression that are compatible with preventing graft rejection while minimizing drug toxicities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second principle is to use low doses of several drugs with non-overlapping toxicities in preference over higher (and more toxic) doses of fewer drugs whenever feasible. Combination regimens are also better able to block the complex immunological cascade that leads to allograft rejection. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third principle is to avoid over-immunosuppression, because it leads to a myriad of undesirable effects including susceptibility to infection and malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is no consensus regarding the optimal regimen for immunosuppression following lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, there are no immunosuppressive medications that are FDA approved for use in lung transplantation. Based on data from case series and clinical experience, we typically initiate maintenance immunosuppression with a combination of three drugs: a glucocorticoid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), a calcineurin inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), and a nucleotide blocking agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [MMF] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60918 \">table 1</a>). The mTOR inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>) are the newest drugs to be used in lung transplantation maintenance immunosuppression and are being evaluated as alternatives to the nucleotide blocking agents.</p><p>Many drugs used in immunosuppression are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system in the liver. These, along with other drugs that induce and inhibit this enzyme system are listed in the table, along with suggestions for alternatives, additional monitoring, and dose adjustments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32760049\"><span class=\"h1\">AGENTS FOR MAINTENANCE THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32758258\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance therapy for lung transplantation has always included glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids inhibit both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The principle effect of glucocorticoids is to turn off gene transcription of multiple inflammatory genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The result is a decrease in the inflammatory response through reduced production of cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;, section on 'Molecular mechanisms of T-cell activation'</a>.)</p><p>There is considerable variability among centers related to glucocorticoid protocols but several general trends can be highlighted. An initial intravenous dose of 500 to 1000 mg of methylprednisone is typically administered intraoperatively at the time of reperfusion of the allograft(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60918 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subsequently, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is given orally at 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, or an equivalent dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is administered intravenously until the patient is able to take oral medications. The relative potencies of the different glucocorticoid preparations are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52276 \">table 3</a>). </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> is tapered to 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> during the first year post lung transplant; in most patients, this goal can be achieved by three months post transplant. Episodes of acute rejection are treated with high dose parenteral glucocorticoids, which are tapered back to the maintenance dose over several weeks. The majority of patients stay on prednisone for life, although a few patients are able to successfully wean off of it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;, section on 'High-dose glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>Glucocorticoids are associated with a number of side effects including, but not limited to, diabetes, fluid retention, hypertension, emotional lability, poor wound healing, and susceptibility to infection. Efforts have been made to minimize glucocorticoid use in the lung transplantation population due to these side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32758265\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (CsA) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (TAC). CNIs are felt to be essential components of maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation, and protocols without a CNI generally are not recommended due to insufficient evidence of their efficacy. Currently, the majority of centers use TAC as part of the maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32758272\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The success of CsA was first demonstrated in lung transplantation in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. CsA was revolutionary in the field of organ transplantation because it was the first T-cell-selective drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. CsA binds to intracellular proteins (cyclophilin) that inhibit calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that is critical for T-cell activation. Through calcineurin inhibition, transcription of IL-2 and several other cytokines is inhibited. CsA, therefore, inhibits activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]<strong>.</strong> </p><p>In general, an initial dose of CsA of 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is administered at the time of transplantation as a 24 hour infusion or half the dose as a 4 hour infusion twice a day and continued until the patient is able to take oral medication; dosing is adjusted per target concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60918 \">table 1</a>). The maintenance oral dose is 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice a day, orally as a tablet or a suspension. CsA can be administered intravenously, for those unable to take oral medication. The intravenous dose is about 30 percent of the usual oral dose because of improved bioavailability and because it is given as a continuous infusion.</p><p>Because CsA has significant inter- and intraindividual absorption variability and a narrow therapeutic window, monitoring of drug levels is crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Trough levels are targeted at 250 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> during the initial post-transplant year and 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> subsequently. Because trough levels correlate poorly with the systemic effects of CsA some centers base dosing on CsA levels drawn at two or three hours post dose (called C2 and C3, respectively) as these are more reflective of exposure to CsA over time. The goal is to maintain the C2 levels between 900 and 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for the first year post transplant. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> is cleared in the bile after extensive metabolism in the liver by CYP 3A4, and thus there are substantial drug-drug interactions with other medications metabolized via CYP 3A4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 4</a>).

Based on data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, over 90 percent of lung transplant recipients in the United States were taking TAC in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. TAC binds with the cytoplasmic immunophilin, FK binding protein 12 (FKBP-12) and inactivates calcineurin, thus inhibiting both interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. Ultimately, T cell activation and proliferation are inhibited. TAC is more potent in its immunosuppressive properties than CsA, but is less nephrotoxic, possibly because it induces transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B1) to a lesser extent than CsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Intravenous (IV) administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> has been associated with infusion reactions (including anaphylaxis) and an increased risk of neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity compared with oral use, so oral or sublingual dosing is generally preferred. Sublingual administration of tacrolimus (ie, using the powder removed from immediate-release capsules) appears to have greater bioavailability than swallowed pills in lung transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving the initial dose of TAC sublingually, the usual dose is approximately 0.04 to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in two divided doses (eg, 1 to 2 mg sublingually every 12 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. A larger or smaller initial dose is selected based on considerations such as concomitant medications and kidney and liver function. Subsequent adjustments are dictated by whole blood trough levels. Additional monitoring and dose adjustment is needed when converting to or from sublingual to oral administration; some centers use a conversion ratio of 1 mg sublingual to 2 mg oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who can absorb orally swallowed capsules, the usual maintenance dose is 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> administered in two divided doses (eg, 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> taken 12 hours apart) at a consistent time each day in relation to meals; subsequent doses are determined as per blood levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving the initial dose of TAC intravenously, the usual dose is 0.03 to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> administered by continuous infusion over 24 hours (although some institutions use an intermittent infusion given every 12 hours). When switching from IV to oral or sublingual dosing, the first dose of oral or sublingual therapy should be given 8 to 12 hours after discontinuing the IV infusion.</p><p/><p>For patients needing to switch from oral to IV administration (eg, during an intercurrent illness), the total daily IV dose is approximately one-third or less than the daily oral dose; this dose may be decreased further if the patient has acute kidney injury or another process that would alter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> metabolism.</p><p>Like CsA, TAC has poor oral absorption, variable bioavailability, and a narrow therapeutic window (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109680 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. To improve absorption, patients should take the drug on an empty stomach or two hours after a meal. Careful monitoring of blood levels is essential; the goal is to maintain serum trough levels between 5 and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. The exact target level within this range depends on the clinical circumstances; the target level may be higher when there is evidence of allograft rejection or lower when there is infection or TAC-related toxicity. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> is cleared in the bile after extensive metabolism in the liver by CYP 3A4, and thus there are substantial drug-drug interactions with other medications metabolized via CYP 3A4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 4</a>).

A randomized trial that included 83 lung transplant recipients showed that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> to maintenance immunosuppression led to an improvement in BOS free survival at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. These data are promising especially in light of the excellent safety profile of azithromycin and other macrolide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, these data must be viewed as preliminary, and additional corroborative data are required before definitive conclusions on efficacy can be reached. The role of azithromycin in the treatment of BOS is discussed separately.

In a retrospective series, 39 lung recipients who were prescribed statin medication for lipid-lowering were compared with 161 contemporary lung recipients not on statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Six year survival was better in the statin group compared with the control group (91 versus 54 percent, respectively). As with macrolides, prospective randomized trials are needed for confirmation of these findings.</p><p>A goal for future immunosuppressive regimens is a better understanding of their effects on inhibition of activation of T cells, depletion of alloreactive T cells, and protection of T regulatory cells and their function, in order to promote tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

To reduce toxicity and achieve adequate suppression of allograft rejection, a combination of immunosuppressive agents is used.
