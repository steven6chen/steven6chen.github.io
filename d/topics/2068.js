In rare cases, it has spread from infected birds to humans. Even though bird flu is rare in humans, when it does happen it is usually severe.</p><p>There are a few different types (also called &quot;strains&quot;) of bird flu. Cases of one strain of bird flu called &quot;H5N1&quot; have occurred in parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. More than 850 people have been found to have H5N1 bird flu since 2003, and about 53 percent of those people have died. H5N1 can make people very sick.</p><p>In the spring of 2013, a new strain of bird flu called &quot;H7N9&quot; was found in people in China. Cases have also occurred in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Canada. The case in Malaysia was a person from China who traveled to Malaysia after getting sick. The 2 cases in Canada were people who had visited China. Outbreaks have happened during each flu season since 2013, mostly in China. The outbreak in late 2016 and early 2017 has been the largest outbreak, affecting at least 460 people. Between the first outbreak in 2013 and early 2017, more than 1300 people had gotten sick from this strain. &#160;</p><p>Many people who have gotten bird flu were around sick or dead birds in the week before they got sick. Scientists think that people who get bird flu usually get it from sick birds. But if the virus that causes bird flu changes or &quot;mutates,&quot; it might become possible for bird flu to be passed from one person to another. In fact, new strains of the bird flu continue to emerge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361466\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the most common symptoms of bird flu?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are different for different strains of bird flu. So far, all strains tend to cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature higher than 100&ordm;F or 37.8&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p>Other symptoms might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or body aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Runny nose</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361481\"><span class=\"h1\">Is bird flu dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, bird flu can be very dangerous. It can cause severe illness. More than half of the people who get sick with H5N1 bird flu die. Around 4 in 10 people who get sick with H7N9 bird flu die. People with bird flu are much more likely to have severe illness and to die than people with seasonal flu.</p><p>At the same time, experts think some people can be exposed to bird flu and only get a little sick, or not get sick at all. So it's possible that more people actually get bird flu than we realize.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361496\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I protect myself from bird flu?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, it's a good idea to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often with soap and water or use alcohol hand rubs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay away from sick people or animals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay away from chickens and other birds in countries where there are outbreaks of bird flu. This includes markets that sell live birds.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361513\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I get symptoms of bird flu?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor of nurse right away if you flu symptoms and have been around sick or dead birds or traveled to a country that has had cases of bird flu. Do not leave your house unless your doctor or nurse tells you to go to a clinic or hospital. Many people with bird flu need to be in the hospital.</p><p>It is especially important to call your doctor or nurse if you: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing or are short of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel pain or pressure in your chest or belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get suddenly dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe vomiting</p><p/><p>While you are at home, rest and drink plenty of fluids. You can also take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) to relieve fever and aches.</p><p>Do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome.</p><p>Take your child to the doctor if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts breathing fast or has trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts to turn blue or purple</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is not drinking enough fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will not wake up or doesn't react to you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is so fussy that he or she does not want to be held</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets better from the flu but then gets sick again with a fever or cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a fever with a rash</p><p/><p>If you go to a walk-in clinic or a hospital because you think you have bird flu, tell someone right away why you are there. The staff will ask you to wear a mask or to wait somewhere where you are less likely to spread your infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361530\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bird flu be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, people with bird flu usually get medicines called &quot;anti-viral medicines.&quot; These medicines can help people avoid some of the problems caused by bird flu. Antibiotics <strong>do not work</strong> on the flu.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361547\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any kind of flu can be very dangerous for pregnant women. If you are pregnant, it is very important that you get vaccinated against seasonal flu. You should also avoid taking care of anyone who has the flu.</p><p>If you are pregnant, call your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You might have been near someone with the flu.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You think you might be coming down with the flu. In pregnant women, the symptoms of the flu can get worse very quickly. The flu can even cause trouble breathing or lead to death of the woman or her baby. That is why it is so important to talk to doctor or nurse as soon as you notice any flu symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9361564\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
