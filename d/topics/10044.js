It sometimes leads to serious heart rhythm problems that can be life threatening.</p><p>There are 2 main types of long QT syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A type that people are born with &ndash; This is caused by an abnormal gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A type that happens later in life that people are not born with &ndash; Certain medicines can cause long QT syndrome. Mineral imbalances in the body, such as having too little potassium or magnesium, can also cause long QT syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70626980\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of long QT syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with long QT syndrome have no symptoms. They find out they have it after they have a test called an electrocardiogram done for another reason. An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) measures the electrical activity in the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>When long QT syndrome causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartbeat changes called &quot;palpitations&quot; &ndash; These can feel like your heart is beating hard or fast, or skipping beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting, or feeling like you are going to faint</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can make people pass out or move or behave strangely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac arrest &ndash; This is when the heart suddenly stops beating. It is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70627012\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for long QT syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. An ECG usually shows whether someone has long QT syndrome. But some people will have other tests, too. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Holter monitor &ndash; This is a heart monitor device that records your heart's electrical activity over hours or days. You wear it around at home while you go about your usual activities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stress test &ndash; During this test, a doctor, nurse, or physician assistant records your ECG while you exercise on a treadmill or bike, or get medicine to make your heart pump faster (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60855 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to see how your heartbeat changes when you get certain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests, including tests to check for the abnormal gene that causes long QT syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70627073\"><span class=\"h1\">How is long QT syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends mostly on whether you were born with long QT syndrome or developed it later in life.</p><p>For people who were born with long QT syndrome, the main treatment includes medicines called beta blockers. These medicines help keep the heart from beating too fast. Some people need other treatments, too. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of heart medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pacemaker &ndash; This is a device that goes under the skin near a person's heart. It sends electrical signals to the heart to control the heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (called an &quot;ICD&quot;) &ndash; This is a device that is put under a person's skin near his or her heart. It can sense abnormal heartbeats and then treat them with an electrical shock.</p><p/><p>For people who develop long QT syndrome later in life, treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping any medicine that could be causing the long QT syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fixing the mineral imbalance that is causing the long QT syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pacemaker</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that control the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat</p><p/><p>All people with long QT syndrome who have a sudden cardiac arrest should be treated with defibrillation. This involves using a device to send an electrical shock to the heart. It sometimes works to get a normal heart rhythm started again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70627088\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have long QT syndrome, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow all of your doctor's instructions about follow-up tests, so that he or she can monitor your condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid taking medicines that are likely to cause long QT syndrome. Your doctor can give you a list of these medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your family members know. Because long QT syndrome can run in families, they might need to be tested for the condition, too.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse whether you need to make any lifestyle changes. With some types of long QT syndrome that people are born with, abnormal heart rhythms are triggered by certain things. These include intense exercise, loud or sudden noises, or diving into cold water. If you have this type of long QT syndrome, you will need to avoid these triggers as much as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70627103\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sudden cardiac arrest (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-tachycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ventricular tachycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpr-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: CPR for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpr-for-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: CPR for children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cardioversion (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
