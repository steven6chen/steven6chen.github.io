Common triggers for EN include infection, drugs, pregnancy, malignancy, and inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis or gastrointestinal diseases; however, many cases are idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109908 \">table 1</a>). The characteristic histologic finding in EN is a septal panniculitis without vasculitis. </p><p>EN usually resolves spontaneously within several weeks. When necessary, treatment can be given to reduce symptoms or hasten resolution.</p><p>The etiologies, diagnosis, and management of EN will be reviewed here. Other forms of panniculitis and erythema nodosum leprosum (a complication of leprosy that is also known as a type 2 reaction) are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panniculitis: Recognition and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy#H2780058\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leprosy&quot;, section on 'Type 2 reaction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2277665969\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EN occurs in all ages, sexes, and racial groups but is most common in women in their second to fourth decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women are affected three to six times more often than men. The specific incidence of EN varies based upon the local prevalence of the associated triggering diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2942168375\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728728090\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EN<strong> </strong>is considered a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction resulting from exposure to various antigens; however, the pathogenesis is not fully understood. The pathogenic mechanism may involve immune complex deposition in the septal venules of the subcutaneous fat, neutrophil recruitment with resulting reactive oxygen species formation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production, and granuloma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>There may be a genetic predisposition to EN; however data are limited. There have been familial reports with a shared human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] as well as a study demonstrating a correlation of EN in sarcoidosis with the TNF alpha-II allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. EN has also been associated with several established inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2942168375\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EN can occur secondary to a wide variety of conditions. However, in many patients, no cause of EN is found. A Spanish retrospective study of 106 patients with EN failed to find a precipitating factor in 37 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Moreover, in a Turkish series of 100 patients with EN, 53 percent had EN of unknown etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Infection is the most commonly identified etiology, with streptococcal infection the most common cause. EN may also occur secondary to drugs (eg, oral contraceptives), inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, sarcoidosis, pregnancy, and other conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109908 \">table 1</a>). &#160;</p><p>EN may offer some prognostic or predictive information regarding associated systemic diseases. EN tends to precede or accompany a flare of inflammatory bowel disease and is associated with a lower incidence of disseminated disease in coccidioidomycosis and a less aggressive form of sarcoidosis, termed Lofgren syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>]. Lofgren syndrome comprises the triad of EN occurring in association with hilar adenopathy and acute arthritis or periarthritis (usually involving the ankles) and is often self-limiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-arthropathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid arthropathy&quot;, section on 'Acute arthritis and Lofgren's syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1787703514\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classically, EN manifests as erythematous, usually tender, nonulcerated, immobile nodules on the bilateral shins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F108925%7EDERM%2F76621%7EDERM%2F55744%7EDERM%2F108926\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108925 graphicRef76621 graphicRef55744 graphicRef108926 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The nodules are slightly raised and typically 2 to 5 cm in diameter. Less frequently, lesions can coalesce into plaques or arise on other areas such as the ankles, thighs, arms, buttocks, calves, or face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F108927\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108927 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>The nodules develop over several days and may follow a prodrome of fatigue, fever, malaise, arthralgias, or upper respiratory infection symptoms by one to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Joint swelling, erythema, or pain may accompany the skin manifestations. &#160;</p><p>Nodules typically resolve spontaneously without scarring within eight weeks of presentation. Secondary bruising, also known as &quot;erythema contusiformis,&quot; often occurs during resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Residual hyperpigmentation may take weeks to months to resolve. </p><p>Chronic EN is a rare subtype of EN with no identifiable cause that flares intermittently over years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients may develop solitary or multiple nodules on the lower legs. The degree of inflammation tends to be less pronounced than in classic EN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Chronic EN is distinct from relapsing EN related to an underlying chronic condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109908 \">table 1</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1805889223\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EN is a predominantly septal panniculitis without primary vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F108928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108928 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Early lesions will demonstrate septal edema with mild lymphocytic infiltrates, though neutrophils may be prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A secondary vasculitis may be seen when there is a dense, mixed, or neutrophil-heavy inflammatory infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Concomitant thrombophlebitis may be present, particularly in cases associated with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], and an eosinophil-rich variant has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Miescher's radial granulomas are a characteristic feature of early EN consisting of groups of macrophages surrounding cleft-like spaces or neutrophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110243\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110243 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The macrophages may appear more epithelioid or as multinucleated giant cells in older lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>With time, septal thickening with a mixed and granulomatous infiltrate occurs with fibrosis and possible extension of the inflammation into the adjacent fat lobules. However, lobular inflammation should not be the predominant finding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3542620694\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, a diagnosis of EN can be made based upon the patient history and physical examination. Findings that strongly suggest EN include the acute onset of tender nodules or plaques on the bilateral shins. Ulceration should be absent. Skin biopsy is helpful for confirming the diagnosis in patients with an atypical presentation. Examples of features that would prompt a biopsy include a location other than the anterior lower legs as the primary site of involvement, purpura, ulceration, large nodules (eg, &gt;5 cm), and underlying immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H1805889223\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p>There are no laboratory abnormalities specific to EN; however, patients may have laboratory abnormalities related to the underlying disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109908 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H671214772\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for underlying disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671214772\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR UNDERLYING DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of EN should be followed by an assessment for an associated cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109908 \">table 1</a>). Initial testing should focus on identifying the most common and important etiologies, particularly streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis, in addition to other conditions common to the patient's geographic area or suggested by findings on a review of systems. No cause is found in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H2942168375\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical assessment </strong>&ndash; A medication history should be obtained to identify drug-associated EN. A travel history can be helpful to elucidate possible exposure to endemic infectious organisms. In addition, a review of systems with careful attention to respiratory, gastrointestinal, and constitutional symptoms is helpful for detecting patients at risk for underlying disease, such as sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, unintentional weight loss, significant fatigue, other prior skin lesions, and joint pain. (See <a href=\"#H2942168375\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given that streptococcal infection is the most common infectious cause of EN, examination of the throat and tonsils should be performed to assess for signs of streptococcal pharyngitis (eg, pharyngeal erythema, tonsillar hypertrophy, or purulent exudate).

Nodular vasculitis usually occurs on the posterior calves with ulcerated, draining nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53596\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53596 \">picture 5</a>). Patients with tuberculosis-associated disease are likely to have a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> or interferon-gamma release assay. In addition, mycobacterial DNA can be detected in lesions using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Nodules or plaques most often present on legs and feet but also occur in other sites, such as the abdomen, axilla, arm, hand, or gluteal region. The lesions are fluctuant, ulcerate, and drain. There may be systemic signs of infection if the infection is widespread.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa </strong>&ndash; Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is characterized by painful subcutaneous nodules on the legs, usually accompanied by livedo racemosa, necrosis, and ulceration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75391%7EDERM%2F64023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75391 graphicRef64023 \">picture 6A-B</a>).

The arms, chest, abdomen, and scalp are additional potential sites of involvement. The nodules may become fluctuant or ulcerative, draining oily fluid, and heal with scarring. Additional features may include fever, arthritis, and abdominal pain. Laboratory testing reveals elevated lipase, amylase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trypsin levels.

Treatment often is not necessary, particularly for mild cases. Reasons for treatment include significant discomfort, inability to bear weight, extensive skin involvement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic or recurrent disease. &#160;</p><p>No randomized trials have evaluated interventions for EN.

NSAIDs are the most common first-line therapies for EN given the wide availability of NSAIDs and high clinician familiarity with these agents. </p><p>Potassium iodide can lead to rapid improvement in EN and is a favored choice when rapid resolution is desired. However, potassium iodide is difficult to obtain in some locations. In addition, caution is recommended for use of potassium iodide in patients with tuberculosis based upon limited historical data that suggest iodides may promote the appearance of tubercle bacilli in the sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Therefore, NSAIDs are our preferred first-line therapy for patients with EN and unknown tuberculosis status.</p><p>Patients with severe, debilitating EN may be best managed with a short course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3048091652\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2829238796\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs may be particularly helpful for alleviating symptoms and accelerating resolution of nondebilitating, mild EN.

The bitter taste of SSKI can be lessened with dilution in juice or water. </p><p>The optimum duration of potassium iodide therapy for EN is unclear. If improvement does not occur within two to three weeks, we discontinue treatment. For patients who respond to potassium iodide, we typically continue treatment for two to three weeks after resolution. &#160;</p><p>Potassium iodide therapy generally is well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are mild and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain, all of which can be mitigated by slow increases in dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Caution is recommended for use of potassium iodide in patients with tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2115167390\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Iodine or potassium toxicity is a potential adverse effect of potassium iodide but does not typically occur with the short courses used for erythema nodosum. Iodism symptoms include mouth burning or increased salivation, metallic taste, tooth and gum soreness, and headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Symptoms of hyperkalemia include confusion, weakness, hand numbness, and arrhythmia; risk is increased in patients with impaired renal function or who are taking potassium-sparing diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism can also result, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level should be checked in patients receiving more than one month of potassium iodide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythema-nodosum/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Caution is warranted in patients taking potassium or iodine-containing medications.
