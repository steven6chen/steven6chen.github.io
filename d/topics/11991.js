Maternal nutrition or endocrine profile during gestation is probably an important determinant of metabolic programming.

High prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and excessive gestational weight gain are risk factors for childhood obesity. In addition, infants born to diabetic mothers have a higher risk of being overweight as children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], as do children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A substantial component of adolescent obesity is established before five years of age. Studies with longer term follow-up reveal that childhood obesity typically persists into adulthood, particularly for children with an obese parent. Obesity in adolescence is associated with severe obesity in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Women experience modest increases in body weight and fat distribution after a first pregnancy; these changes are persistent and vary according to race and ethnic background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, when compared with nulliparous women, the overall risk of weight gain associated with childbearing is quite small for American women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

A few women gain a large amount of weight during pregnancy, occasionally as much as 50 kg. Excessive gestational weight gain increases the risk of postpartum weight retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-gain-and-loss-in-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weight gain and loss in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral contraceptives &ndash; Many women and their clinicians believe that oral contraceptives cause weight gain. However, available data suggest that significant weight gain is probably not a common side effect of oral contraceptives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Weight'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopause &ndash; Weight gain and changes in fat distribution often occur in the early postmenopausal years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The magnitude of the increase depends upon the method of measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), waist circumference and fat mass were measured with bioelectrical impedence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Over a six-year period, there was an increase in weight (cumulative six-year change, 2.9 kg) and waist circumference (5.7 cm). The rate of increase in waist circumference slowed one year after the final menstrual period, whereas fat mass continued to increase with no change in rate. Thus, both aging in general and ovarian aging contribute to the increase in weight and changes in body composition noted during the menopause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;, section on 'Long-term consequences of estrogen deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Estrogen therapy does not prevent weight gain in postmenopausal women, although it may minimize fat redistribution. In a three-year substudy of women in the Women's Health Initiative, women who received estrogen and progesterone therapy lost significantly less lean soft tissue mass than did the women who received placebo (-0.04 versus -0.44 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the women in the treatment group had less change in ratio of trunk-to-leg fat mass. Although this intervention significantly reduced both the loss of lean soft tissue mass and the ratio of trunk-to-leg fat mass in postmenopausal women, the effect was small and it is unclear whether these changes in body composition lead to significant health benefits.

A rise in body weight continues until the sixth decade. After ages 55 to 64 years, relative weight remains stable, and then begins to decline. There is evidence from the Framingham Study and studies of men in the armed services that men have become progressively heavier for height over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term risk of becoming overweight (BMI &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> or obese (BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> during adulthood appears to be very high. This was illustrated in a prospective cohort study of 4117 men and women (mostly Caucasian, ages 30 to 59 years) where the following results were seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within four years, 14 to 19 percent of women and 26 to 30 percent of men who were normal weight at baseline became overweight; 5 to 9 percent of men and women who were either normal weight or overweight at baseline became obese.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within 30 years, more than 50 percent of individuals became overweight, while approximately 30 and 25 percent of women and men, respectively, became obese.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFESTYLE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3479106\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sedentary lifestyle lowers energy expenditure and promotes weight gain.</p><p>Several observations illustrate the importance of decreased energy expenditure in the pathogenesis of weight gain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study examining trends in occupational physical activity in the United States during the past 50 years, energy-sparing devices in the workplace and at home reduce energy expenditure and may enhance the tendency to gain weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), obesity was more strongly and inversely related to moderately vigorous physical activity than either television (TV) time or total sedentary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Less risk was seen with other sedentary behavior, such as sitting at work. The effects of TV on obesity are mediated, in part, by changes in energy intake, rather than changes in physical activity alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p>Obesity is more prevalent in adults with physical, sensory, or mental health disabilities.

Sleep restriction, when compared with sleep extension, was associated with a decrease in serum leptin (an anorexigenic hormone), an increase in serum ghrelin (an orexigenic hormone), and increased hunger and appetite (in particular for calorie-dense foods with high carbohydrate content) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Observational data also suggest a possible association between sleep restriction and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Since the 1970s, the quantity of refined carbohydrates and fats increased in the United States food supply, resulting in a dramatic increase in total calorie intake. Increasing trends in glycemic index of foods, sugar-containing beverages, portion sizes for prepared foods, fast food service, diminishing family presence at meals, and school meal nutrition content, combined with a continued decline in physical activity, has contributed to the rise in obesity in the United States and worldwide. </p><p>There are several settings in which dietary factors become important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary habits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiological data suggest that a diet high in fat and sugar is associated with obesity.

In contrast, intake of vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt was inversely associated with weight gain. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juice) is an important contributor to the development of obesity in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>There may also be an interaction between dietary habits and a genetic predisposition for obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As an example, in an evaluation of 32 body mass index (BMI) loci associated with obesity in two large prospective cohort studies, there was an interaction between the genetic-predisposition score and the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, such that adults with a higher genetic-predisposition score appeared to be more susceptible to the adverse effects of sugar-sweetened beverages on BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-etiology-and-natural-history/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].
