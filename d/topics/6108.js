Approval was based upon the results of three phase 3 trials involving a total of 1633 patients ages 16 and older who had chronic HBV infection, persistently elevated serum ALT levels (&ge;1.3x the upper limit of normal), and chronic inflammation on liver biopsy. Entecavir has also been studied in patients who were refractory to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and in <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HIV</span> coinfected patients.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the treatment of chronic hepatitis B with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>.

Serum HBV DNA decreased from baseline by an average of 6.86 log(10) compared with 5.39 log(10) in the lamivudine group. Suppression of HBV DNA to less than 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mL</span> (approximately 140,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> and normalization of serum ALT were observed significantly more often in the entecavir group (91 versus 65 percent and 78 versus 70 percent, respectively).

Serious adverse events were described in 7 percent of patients in both groups.</p><p>Treatment was extended until HBeAg loss or up to 96 weeks in a subset of patients who remained HBeAg positive but had HBV DNA less than 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mL</span> (ie, less than approximately 140,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> at week 48 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At week 96 or earlier (for patients who achieved HBeAg loss before week 96), HBV DNA was undetectable in a larger proportion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> treated patients (80 versus 39 percent). Normalization of ALT was observed in 87 versus 79 percent, and HBeAg seroconversion in 31 versus 25 percent. The safety profile was similar to lamivudine throughout the observation period.</p><p>Analysis of cumulative responses up to week 96 of all patients originally enrolled into the study found that the proportion of patients achieving HBeAg seroconversion were similar (31 versus 25 percent). However, this analysis did not take into account HBeAg reversion after treatment was stopped.</p><p>A follow-up report described a subset of 146 patients who received continuous therapy for up to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The group was comprised mainly of virologic responders but also included 19 patients who failed to respond during the first year of treatment. All patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> 1 mg daily from year three onward. During years three, four, and five, an increasing proportion of patients achieved and maintained HBV DNA levels &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately 60 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> (94 percent by year five). In addition, 33 additional patients (23 percent) achieved HBeAg seroconversion, and two patients (1.4 percent) lost HBsAg during continued treatment. These data confirm that continued treatment can result in late HBeAg seroconversion in some patients. In a separate follow-up report that focused on 40 HBeAg-positive patients, all of whom achieved HBV DNA levels of &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and most of whom had normal aminotransferase levels, treatment with entecavir for five years was associated with a decrease in inflammation as well as fibrosis scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The mean HBV DNA change from baseline to week 48 was significantly greater with entecavir (-6.23 versus -4.42 log(10) <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span>. In addition, significantly more patients receiving entecavir achieved undetectable (&lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> or approximately 60 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> HBV DNA levels by PCR between weeks 2 to 48. At 48 weeks, only 3 percent of entecavir treated patients had HBV DNA of 10(5) <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately 20,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> or more compared with 47 percent of adefovir treated patients.

The mean reduction in HBV DNA was significantly greater in the entecavir group, and undetectable HBV DNA by PCR occurred significantly more often (90 versus 72 percent).

The proportion of patients with ALT normalization was significantly higher in the entecavir group (90 versus 72 percent). Serious adverse events were comparable (6 versus 8 percent). Long-term responses are unclear because most patients were taken off treatment at the end of year one.

Although the original package insert for entecavir indicated no anti-HIV activity by in vitro testing at clinically relevant concentrations, a one-log drop in HIV RNA was reported in three separate patients who were taking entecavir monotherapy. One of these three patients was also shown to have selection of lamivudine-resistant M184V HIV variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Data from this study and subsequent studies show that entecavir should not be used in HIV-HBV co-infected patients who are not receiving fully suppressive antiretroviral regimens.

One of the largest series included 36 patients considered to have a severe exacerbation because of an increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal with an increase in total bilirubin levels more than three times the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients received entecavir for 48 weeks. Compared with a group of 117 patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> for a severe exacerbation, the patients who received entecavir had an unexpectedly increased risk of prolonged jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and early mortality. However, this difference may be related to the small number of patients, the older age, and more advanced liver disease in the entecavir group. The authors' suggestion that rapid viral suppression may be deleterious in patients with severe exacerbation is not substantiated by another larger study in patients with decompensated cirrhosis showing that a more rapid viral response with entecavir compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a> was associated with a similar if not better outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/entecavir-in-the-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. We recommend initiating antiviral therapy as soon as possible in patients with severe exacerbation. Interferon should not be used in this setting.
