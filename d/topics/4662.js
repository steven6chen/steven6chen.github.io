There are few indications for this procedure in current practice. Historically, it was used to evaluate women for hematoperitoneum secondary to ruptured ectopic pregnancy or ruptured ovarian cyst, or for a pelvic infection. However, this role has largely been replaced by evaluation with pelvic imaging, image-guided aspiration of fluid, and minimally invasive surgery. </p><p>The culdocentesis procedure is reviewed here. Other approaches to the evaluation of women with suspected pelvic bleeding or infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culdocentesis may be used to evaluate women with pain in the lower <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span> to determine whether intraabdominal fluid is present and, if present, to reveal the nature of the fluid (eg, serous, purulent, bloody). Thus, the procedure can be helpful in evaluating women with a suspected ruptured ovarian cyst, pelvic inflammatory disease, or ruptured ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/culdocentesis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound examination has largely replaced culdocentesis because it accurately identifies the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> fluid, is more comfortable for the patient, and provides additional information about the pelvis, such as whether there is an adnexal mass or intrauterine pregnancy. Findings on ultrasonography are especially useful when interpreted in conjunction with laboratory test results, such as a complete blood count and pregnancy test. However, culdocentesis may be useful when ultrasonography is not readily available or to obtain fluid directly from the peritoneal cavity. For example, culdocentesis is proposed as an alternative method for collecting peritoneal fluid for measuring tumor markers, to be used in conjunction with serum markers and microbial profiles, to aid in diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/culdocentesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the past, cytologic evaluation of peritoneal fluid obtained by culdocentesis was used to diagnose ovarian cancer, but culdocentesis is no longer routinely performed for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/culdocentesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the procedure, a bimanual examination should be performed to ascertain that the posterior cul-de-sac does not contain cysts, masses, or other structures that might contaminate the peritoneal cavity if perforated or that could impede access to free fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac. A fixed retroverted uterus or a bleeding diathesis are additional contraindications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relevant anatomy is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59177\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59177 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMED CONSENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A consent form for culdocentesis should include the purpose of the procedure, explanation of what will happen in understandable terms, risks and complications, alternatives, and possible outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the patient's history to exclude <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> suggestive of a bleeding disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a pelvic (bimanual) examination to assess the posterior cul-de-sac and identify possible pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain written informed consent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the patient to walk or sit upright for 10 to 15 minutes to allow abdominopelvic fluid to pool in the posterior cul-de-sac.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organize instruments for the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explain each step of the culdocentesis to the patient so she knows what to expect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquire about allergies to medications and iodine so these agents can be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERIALS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speculum &ndash; The medium Graves speculum is preferred.

Paracervical block or no anesthesia are other options. The failure rate of paracervical block can be as high as 18 percent and complications rarely occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/culdocentesis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Steps</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place patient in the dorsal lithotomy position with the head of the examining table elevated 60 degrees to allow peritoneal fluid to pool in the posterior cul-de-sac.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert speculum to visualize cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleanse vagina and cervix with antiseptic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel to the posterior vagina and posterior cervical lip (optional). Needle puncture for anesthesia may be as painful as the procedure itself and may cause bleeding in the posterior cul-de-sac because the vaginal mucosa of the posterior fornix is very vascular. However, some clinicians opt to inject anesthesia into the submucosa of the site of puncture or posterior fornix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/culdocentesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grasp the posterior lip of the cervix with the tenaculum and lift the cervix slightly to expose the posterior fornix, which is bounded laterally by the uterosacral ligaments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert an 18-gauge needle attached to a 20 mL syringe containing 5 mL of normal saline (or air) through the posterior vaginal wall into the posterior cul-de-sac using a rapid, deliberate thrust. The insertion point is in the midline, about 1 to 2 cm below the insertion of the uterosacral ligaments onto the uterus and inferior to posterior border of the vaginal mucosa and the cervix (in the posterior vaginal fornix). At that point, the insertion of the needle into the vaginal mucosa will enter posterior pelvic cul-de-sac. The needle should not extend more than 3 to 4 cm through the vaginal mucosa and is directed slightly caudad, away from the uterus and toward the sacrum.</p><p/><p>An 18-gauge needle is suggested to avoid clotting and increase the yield of the sample. The large needle size may slightly increase the risk of vascular puncture; however, puncture is rare in experienced hands.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inject 5 mL of normal saline (preferred, although air can also be injected) to confirm placement and clear tissue from the needle point.

Discontinue the procedure if unsuccessful after two or three attempts.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent steps depend upon type of aspirated fluid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small amount of <strong>clear fluid</strong> is normal. Copious peritoneal fluid suggests a ruptured fluid filled cyst or ascites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac can also be a normal finding. However, a <strong>dry tap</strong> is considered unsatisfactory and suggests that the needle tip is obstructed by tissue due to poor positioning, adhesions, or other pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonclotting blood indicates active intraperitoneal bleeding. Determine the hematocrit: A hematocrit over 15 percent is most consistent with hemorrhage from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or actively bleeding ruptured corpus luteum while a hematocrit less than 8 percent is more consistent with blood tinged fluid from a ruptured ovarian cyst or pelvic inflammation. Injection of 5 mL of saline as above does not significantly impact the hematocrit of the peritoneal fluid unless minimal fluid is aspirated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Steps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clotting blood suggests blood from a vein or artery may have been aspirated. The most common site of vessel perforation is the uterine vein. Remove the needle, reinsert a new needle, and aspirate again. The 18-gauge needle is suggested to avoid clotting and increase collected sample yield. The slightly larger needle may slightly increase the risk of puncture. However, risks of puncture are rare in experienced hands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of <strong>pus</strong> indicates an infectious process, possibly as abscess. Further evaluation of the source of pus can include further exploration using a blunt instrument or gentle exploration with a finger. Sending the aspirate for culture and gram stain may assist with evaluation. Anaerobic cultures typically require a minimum sample of 5 mL; we aim to submit 5 to 10 mL of aspirate. </p><p/><p>The incidence of a false positive test for nonclotting blood is less than 2 percent. The presence of nonclotting blood, particularly in a hemodynamically unstable patient, indicates a need for stabilization and surgery to identify and treat the source of bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Surgical treatment&quot;</a>.) Additional tests may be indicated prior to surgery, as time permits, depending on the individual clinical circumstances. As an example, if the pregnancy test is negative then a nongynecological source of bleeding should be considered. In trauma patients, the possibility of hepatic or splenic rupture should be suspected and a general surgeon consulted.</p><p>Purulent fluid indicates infection. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the leading gynecological cause, but nongynecological etiologies should also be considered (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aspiration of clear fluid merely indicates that there is no collection of pus or blood in the pelvis. It does not exclude the possibility of an unruptured ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst, tubal infection, or other gynecologic or nongynecologic pathology. Further evaluation is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious complications are rare. There is risk of puncturing the anterior division of the internal iliac vessels or the obturator or pudendal nerve. Inadvertent bowel perforation generally does not lead to morbidity.
