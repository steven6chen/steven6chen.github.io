However, cardiopulmonary support can also be delivered in a more prolonged fashion in an intensive care unit, although it is less common.</p><p>Prolonged cardiopulmonary support is called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), extracorporeal life support, or extracorporeal lung assist. There are two types of ECMO &ndash; venoarterial (VA) and venovenous (VV). Both provide respiratory support, but only VA ECMO provides hemodynamic support.</p><p>The impact of ECMO on clinical outcomes as well as patient selection, technical aspects, and complications will be reviewed here.

After two poorly designed randomized trials of ECMO in the 1970s, all nine subsequent controlled trials show a significant survival benefit to ECMO compared with conventional care in neonates (five trials), children (one trial), and adults (three trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The group referred to the ECMO center had significantly increased survival without disability at six months compared to conventional management (63 versus 47 percent). Twenty five percent of the patients referred for ECMO were not managed with ECMO because five died before transfer to the ECMO center and 16 recovered with the conventional ventilation protocol used by the ECMO center. Of note, the trial defined severe acute respiratory failure as hypercapnic respiratory acidosis with an arterial pH &lt;7.20 or a Murray score greater than 3.0. The Murray score quantitates the severity of lung disease on the basis of the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>),</span> positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), lung compliance, and chest radiograph.

Eighty five percent of the patients referred to an ECMO center were managed with ECMO, while the others improved with conventional ventilation.

Criteria for the initiation of ECMO include acute severe cardiac or pulmonary failure that is potentially reversible and unresponsive to conventional management. Examples of clinical situations that may prompt the initiation of ECMO include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxemic respiratory failure with a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> of &lt;100 mmHg despite optimization of the ventilator settings, including the tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio.

Relative contraindications include uncontrollable bleeding and very poor prognosis from the primary condition.

ECMO should only by performed by clinicians with training and experience in its initiation, maintenance, and discontinuation. </p><p>During ECMO, blood is drained from the native vascular system, circulated outside the body by a mechanical pump, and reinfused into the circulation. While outside the body, the blood passes through an oxygenator and heat exchanger. In the oxygenator, hemoglobin becomes fully saturated with oxygen, while carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is removed. Oxygenation is determined by flow rate, where elimination of CO<sub>2</sub> can be controlled by adjusting the rate of countercurrent gas flow through the oxygenator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>ECMO can be venovenous (VV) or venoarterial (VA):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During VV ECMO, blood is extracted from the vena cava or right atrium and returned to the right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56622 \">figure 1</a>). VV ECMO provides respiratory support, but the patient is dependent upon his or her own hemodynamics. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During VA ECMO, blood is extracted from the right atrium and returned to the arterial system, bypassing the heart and lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80969\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80969 \">figure 2</a>). VA ECMO provides both respiratory and hemodynamic support. The additional benefit of hemodynamic support comes with additional risks, which are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'VA ECMO-specific complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once it has been decided that ECMO will be initiated, the patient is anticoagulated (usually with intravenous heparin) and then the cannulae are inserted. ECMO support is initiated once the cannulae are connected to the appropriate limbs of the ECMO circuit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannulas are usually placed percutaneously by Seldinger technique. The largest cannulas that can be placed in the vessels are used. </p><p>For VV ECMO, venous cannulae are usually placed in the right or left common femoral vein (for drainage) and right internal jugular vein (for infusion). The tip of the femoral cannula should be maintained near the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium, while the tip of the internal jugular cannula should be maintained near the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. Alternatively, a double lumen cannula is available that is large enough to accommodate 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> of blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is available in a variety of sizes, with 31 French being the largest and most appropriate for adult males. The drainage and infusion ports have been engineered to minimize recirculation.</p><p>For VA ECMO, a venous cannula is placed in the inferior vena cava or right atrium (for drainage) and an arterial cannula is placed into the right femoral artery (for infusion).</p><p>Femoral access is preferred for VA ECMO because insertion is relatively easy. The main drawback of femoral access is ischemia of the ipsilateral lower extremity. The likelihood of this complication can be decreased by inserting an additional arterial cannula distal to the femoral artery cannula and redirecting a portion of the infused blood to the additional cannula for &quot;reperfusion&quot; of the extremity. Alternatively, a cannula can be inserted into the posterior tibial artery for retrograde flow to the extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>Occasionally, the femoral vessels are unsuitable for cannulation for VA ECMO (eg, patients with severe occlusive peripheral artery disease or prior femoral arterial reconstruction). In such circumstances, the right common carotid artery or subclavian artery can be used. In our experience, there is a 5 to 10 percent risk of a large watershed cerebral infarction when the right common carotid artery is used. Use of the subclavian artery offers the advantage of allowing patients on ECMO to ambulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>For postcardiotomy ECMO, the cannulas employed for cardiopulmonary bypass can be transferred from the heart lung machine to the ECMO circuit, with blood drained from the right atrium and reinfused into the ascending aorta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Titration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following cannulation, the patient is connected to the ECMO circuit and the blood flow is increased until respiratory and hemodynamic parameters are satisfactory. Reasonable targets include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of &gt;90 percent for VA ECMO, or &gt;75 percent for VV ECMO</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A venous oxyhemoglobin saturation 20 to 25 percent lower than the arterial saturation, measured on the venous line</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate tissue perfusion, as determined by the arterial blood pressure, venous oxygen saturation, and blood lactate level</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the initial respiratory and hemodynamic goals have been achieved, the blood flow is maintained at that rate. Frequent assessment and adjustments are facilitated by continuous venous oximetry, which directly measures the oxyhemoglobin saturation of the blood in the venous limb of the ECMO circuit. When the venous oxyhemoglobin saturation is below target, interventions that may be helpful include increasing one or more of the following: blood flow, intravascular volume, or hemoglobin concentration. Decreasing the systemic oxygen uptake by reducing the temperature may also be helpful.</p><p>Anticoagulation is sustained during ECMO with a continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or direct thrombin inhibitor titrated to an activated clotting time (ACT) of 180 to 210 seconds. The ACT target is decreased if bleeding develops. ACT is easily determined at the point of care, but plasma PTT (1.5 times normal) can also be used. Thromboelastography is a useful adjunct. When heparin is used, the anticoagulant effect is dependent on the amount of endogenous anti thrombin (AT3). If AT3 deficiency is suspected, the level can be measured. If less than 50 percent normal, AT3 is replaced by fresh frozen plasma. Less commonly, some specialized centers follow factor Xa levels. One review of 16 studies suggested that optimal targets vary among centers resulting in variable rates of bleeding and thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Platelets are continuously consumed during ECMO because they are activated by exposure to the foreign surface area. Platelet counts should be maintained greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microliter,</span> which may require platelet transfusion.</p><p>The ECMO circuit is often the only source of oxygen in patients with complete cardiac or pulmonary failure. Oxygen delivery depends on the amount of hemoglobin and blood flow. The risks of high blood flow outweigh the risk of transfusion, so hemoglobin is maintained over 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in ECMO patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Ventilator settings are reduced during ECMO in order to avoid barotrauma, volutrauma (ie, ventilator-induced lung injury), and oxygen toxicity. Plateau airway pressures should be maintained less than 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and FiO<sub>2</sub> less than 0.5. Reduction of ventilator support is usually accompanied by increased venous return and cardiac output, which improves cardiac output.</p><p>We perform early tracheostomy to reduce dead space and improve patient comfort. Patients typically require light sedation during ECMO, although we prefer to maintain patients awake, extubated, and breathing spontaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VV ECMO is typically used for respiratory failure, while VA ECMO is used for cardiac failure. There are unique considerations for each type of ECMO, which influence management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood flow &ndash; Near maximum flow rates are usually desired during VV ECMO to optimize oxygen delivery. In contrast, the flow rate used during VA ECMO must be high enough to provide adequate perfusion pressure and venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (measured on drainage blood), but low enough to provide sufficient preload to maintain left ventricular output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuresis &ndash; Since most patients are fluid overloaded when ECMO is initiated, aggressive diuresis is warranted once the patient is stable on ECMO. Ultrafiltration can be easily added to the ECMO circuit if patients are unable to produce sufficient urine for diuresis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular monitoring &ndash; Left ventricular output must be rigorously monitored during VA ECMO because left ventricular output may worsen. The cause is usually multifactorial, including the underlying left ventricular dysfunction and insufficient unloading of the distended left ventricle due to ongoing blood flow to the left ventricle from the bronchial circulation and right ventricle. Left ventricular output can be closely monitored by identifying pulsatility in the arterial line's waveform and by frequent echocardiography. Interventions that can improve left ventricular output include inotropes (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a>) to increase contractility and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation to reduce afterload and facilitate left ventricular output. Immediate left ventricular decompression is essential to avoid pulmonary hemorrhage if left ventricular ejection cannot be maintained despite intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and inotropic agents. This can be accomplished surgically or percutaneously. Methods of percutaneous left ventricular decompression include transatrial balloon septostomy or insertion of a left atrial or ventricular drainage catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Weaning from ECMO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with respiratory failure, improvements in radiographic appearance, pulmonary compliance, and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation indicate that the patient may be ready to be liberated from ECMO. For patients with cardiac failure, enhanced aortic pulsatility correlates with improved left ventricular output and indicates that the patient may be ready to be liberated from ECMO.</p><p>One or more trials of taking the patient off ECMO should be performed prior to discontinuing ECMO permanently:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VV ECMO trials are performed by eliminating all countercurrent sweep gas through the oxygenator. Extracorporeal blood flow remains constant, but gas transfer does not occur. Patients are observed for several hours, during which the ventilator settings that are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation off ECMO are determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VA ECMO trials require temporary clamping of both the drainage and infusion lines, while allowing the ECMO circuit to circulate through a bridge between the arterial and venous limbs. This prevents thrombosis of stagnant blood within the ECMO circuit. In addition, the arterial and venous lines should be flushed continuously with heparinized saline or intermittently with heparinized blood from the circuit. VA ECMO trials are generally shorter in duration than VV ECMO trials because of the higher risk of thrombus formation. </p><p/><p>Once the decision has been made to discontinue ECMO, the cannulae are removed. Hemostasis is achieved by compressing the insertion site. For patients who received VA ECMO, at least thirty minutes of compression is required for the arterial site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major complications are bleeding and thromboembolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding occurs in 30 to 50 percent of patients who receive ECMO and can be life threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/42,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,44</a>]. It is due to both the continuous anticoagulation and platelet dysfunction. Meticulous surgical technique, maintaining platelet counts greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> and maintaining the target activated clotting time (ACT) reduce the likelihood of bleeding.</p><p>Intervention is necessary when major bleeding occurs. Bleeding from surgical wounds often requires prompt exploration with liberal use of electrocautery. Hemorrhage into body cavities (eg, abdomen, pleural space) may require surgical exploration to achieve hemostasis, after which vacuum-assisted closure is recommended because it allows removal and measurement of the blood. Plasminogen inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminocaproic acid</a>) can be infused or heparin can be discontinued for several hours, but these actions may increase the risk of circuit thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Infusion of activated factor VII has been reported with mixed results and should only be considered for life threatening hemorrhage after all other options have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>The target ACT is usually reduced once bleeding occurs and infusions of anticoagulant are reduced or held. As an example, the target ACT may become 170 to 190 seconds, instead of 210 to 230 seconds. With modern devices the anticoagulation can be stopped altogether for days if bleeding is a problem. Recombinant factor VIIa has been administered to some cases of refractory bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic thromboembolism due to thrombus formation within the extracorporeal circuit is a complication that can be devastating with one report suggesting rates as high as 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Its impact is greater with venoarterial (VA) ECMO than venovenous (VV) ECMO because infusion is into the systemic circulation. Anticoagulation that achieves its target ACT and vigilant observation of the circuit for signs of clot formation successfully prevents thromboembolism in most patients.</p><p>Observation of the circuit for signs of clot formation includes routine inspection of all connectors and monitoring the pressure gradient across the oxygenator. A sudden change in the pressure gradient suggests that a thrombus had developed. Large or mobile clots require immediate circuit or component exchange. Primed circuits are usually kept at the bedside if the target ACT has been reduced due to bleeding because the risk of thrombus formation is greatest in this situation. Having a primed circuit available facilitates urgent exchange, if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1604608451\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurological</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of neurologic injury in adult respiratory failure patients recorded in the <a href=\"https://www.elso.org/&amp;token=NyRkA1K+Efcjom0B+qrukvFcezSIP8grIF6J6FVMBCQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1625\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Extracorporeal Life Support Organization</a> (ELSO) registry is 10 percent.

Edema occurs when the left atrial (LA) pressure exceeds 25 mmHg. It is treated by venting the LA or LV. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac thrombosis &ndash; There is retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta whenever the femoral artery and vein are used for VA ECMO. Stasis of the blood can occur if left ventricular output is not maintained, which may result in thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary or cerebral hypoxia &ndash; During VA ECMO, fully saturated blood infused into the femoral artery from the ECMO circuit will preferentially perfuse the lower extremities and the abdominal viscera. Blood ejected from the heart will selectively perfuse the heart, brain, and upper extremities. As a result, the oxyhemoglobin saturation of the blood perfusing the lower extremities and abdominal viscera may be substantially higher than that perfusing the heart, brain, and upper extremities. Cardiac and cerebral hypoxia could exist and be unrecognized if oxygenation is monitored using only blood from the lower extremity. To avoid this complication, arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation should be monitored in the right upper extremity. Poor arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation measured from the upper extremity is corrected by infusing some oxygenated blood into the right atrium (called VA-V access).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurological injury &ndash; In a report of neurologic injury in cardiac (VA) patients in one institution, 42 of 87 patients sustained neurologic injury (approximately 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The types of neurological injury included coma of uncertain cause (11 patients), encephalopathy (11 patients), anoxic brain injury (9 patients), stroke (7 patients), brain death (3 patients), and myoclonus (1 patient). It is important to realize that these findings may be a consequence of the condition that prompted ECMO, rather than a complication of the ECMO process.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applications for ECMO may expand in the future to include percutaneous temporary left ventricular assistance and low flow ECMO for CO<sub>2</sub> removal (ECOOR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, new technologies will improve the simplicity and safety of ECMO, including new oxygenators, pumps, and surface coatings.</p><p>Oxygenators that use hollow fibers constructed of polymethyl-pentene are routine and can be used for weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Advantages compared with older devices include lower priming volume, rapid priming time, diminished plasma leakage, and low blood flow resistance, which may reduce platelet activation and consumption. One study reported that there are no differences among the newer oxygenators regarding the impact on hemostasis, anticoagulation, or hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>In the past, ECMO centers depended upon servoregulated (ie, automatic) roller pumps for blood flow generation, which required continuous observation by trained personnel. Centrifugal pumps without servoregulation have replaced roller pumps in most centers. The advantage is that the outlet pressure is limited, so &quot;blow out&quot; on the high pressure side is unlikely. However, these pumps can cause microcavitation and hemolysis when the inlet is occluded. Newer centrifugal pumps have special rotors, which reduce heat generation and microcavitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

In an ECMO circuit, such coatings could reduce thrombogenicity, obviate the need for continuous anticoagulation, and reduce the incidence of related complications.</p><p>Ambulatory ECMO remains investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a type of prolonged mechanical cardiopulmonary support that is usually delivered in the intensive care unit. ECMO should only be performed in centers with the appropriate equipment and expertise. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with severe, but potentially reversible, acute respiratory or cardiac failure that is unresponsive to conventional management be evaluated for ECMO if it is available within the medical center (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who are in a medical center that does not provide ECMO, transfer to another medical center to be evaluated for ECMO should be considered as soon as it is clear that the patient is not responding to management. The final decision should carefully weigh the survival rates for patients referred to an ECMO center versus the risk of transferring the patient. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two types of ECMO, venovenous (VV) and venoarterial (VA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56622 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80969\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80969 \">figure 2</a>). VV ECMO is used in patients with respiratory failure, while VA ECMO is used in patients with cardiac failure. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once it has been determined that ECMO will be initiated, the patient is anticoagulated. Cannulae are then inserted and the patient is connected to the ECMO circuit. The blood flow is increased until respiratory and hemodynamic parameters are satisfactory. Once the initial respiratory and hemodynamic goals have been achieved, blood flow is maintained, ventilator support is minimized, and vasoactive drugs are decreased to minimal levels. Frequent reassessment and adjustments are usually necessary. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's readiness for weaning from ECMO should be evaluated frequently. Prior to discontinuing ECMO permanently, one or more trials should be performed during which the patient is off ECMO. Such trials give the clinician the opportunity to determine whether conventional supportive care is sufficient for the patient. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Weaning from ECMO'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding is the most common complication (30 to 40 percent) of ECMO. Thromboembolism and cannula complications are rare (&lt;5 percent). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215945186\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Jonathan Haft, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">The Registry of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization. www.elso.org (Accessed on October 09, 2015).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hemmila MR, Rowe SA, Boules TN, et al.
