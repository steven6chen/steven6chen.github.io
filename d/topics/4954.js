RANKL interacts with a receptor (RANK) on both osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. The <span class=\"nowrap\">RANKL/RANK</span> interaction results in activation, migration, differentiation, and fusion of hematopoietic cells of the osteoclast lineage to begin the process of bone resorption. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a>, a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds RANKL, blocks the binding of RANKL to RANK and thereby reduces the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, which results in decreased bone resorption and increased bone density.

Some experts believe that denosumab should not be used as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, because of the availability of oral bisphosphonates, for which there are long-term safety and fracture prevention data. In addition, generic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> is less expensive.

It is available in a single-use, prefilled syringe or a single-use vial. The vial requires a 27-gauge needle with syringe to withdraw and inject the 1 mL dose.

Calcium should be measured in such patients approximately 10 days after denosumab administration. In addition, if a patient with a condition that predisposes to hypocalcemia becomes ill and cannot take oral calcium after having received denosumab, there is a risk of hypocalcemia. Calcium levels should be monitored more frequently in this setting.</p><p>Monitoring of serum calcium is not required in patients without risk factors for hypocalcemia.</p><p>Because serious infections and skin reactions were reported more frequently in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> than in the placebo group, patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop signs of an infection or skin reaction.

However, women were excluded if they had hyperparathyroidism (ie, women with renal dysfunction resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism were not treated with denosumab).</p><p>In a post hoc analysis of the FREEDOM trial data, stratified by level of kidney function, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> was effective in reducing fracture risk and was not associated with an increase in adverse events, including changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), among women with impaired kidney function (eGFR &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/denosumab-for-osteoporosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Within the subgroup of women with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, there were too few events (four vertebral and three nonvertebral fractures) to draw any conclusions. Therefore, there are inadequate data with regard to fracture prevention efficacy in those with more severe kidney disease resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism and in late-stage renal disease (stages 4 and 5). In addition, the lack of published data on safety in this population suggests caution when using the agent in this group, as well as certainty that patients in this category who fracture have osteoporosis and not some form of renal bone disease. More careful monitoring of serum calcium is also required.
