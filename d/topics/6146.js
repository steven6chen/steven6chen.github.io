It is often classified as either primary (absence of menarche by age 15 years) or secondary (absence of menses for more than three months in girls or women who previously had regular menstrual cycles or six months in girls or women who had irregular menses). Missing a single menstrual period may not be important to assess, but amenorrhea lasting three months or more and oligomenorrhea (fewer than nine menstrual cycles per year or cycle length greater than 35 days) require investigation. An intermenstrual interval greater than 45 days is considered abnormal in adolescent girls who are &ge;2 years postmenarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It may occur even in women who claim that they have not been sexually active or are positive that intercourse occurred at a &quot;safe&quot; time. It is also important to note that apparent menstrual bleeding does not exclude pregnancy, since a substantial number of pregnancies are associated with some early first trimester bleeding. Thus, a pregnancy test (measurement of serum or urinary human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) is recommended as a first step in evaluating any woman with amenorrhea.

It is characterized by a presumed decrease in hypothalamic GnRH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The abnormal GnRH secretion characteristic of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea leads to decreased pulses of gonadotropins, absent midcycle surges in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, absence of normal follicular development, anovulation, and low serum estradiol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Variable neuroendocrine patterns of LH secretion can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are low or normal and often exceed those of LH, similar to the pattern in prepubertal girls.</p><p>One of the main clinical concerns in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is bone loss due to hypoestrogenemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management#H691220935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa: Endocrine complications and their management&quot;, section on 'Bone'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689399699\"><span class=\"h4\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, including eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa), excessive exercise, and stress. However, in a few women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, no obvious precipitating factor is evident. The term hypothalamic amenorrhea is often used interchangeably with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both weight loss below a certain target level (approximately 10 percent below ideal body weight) and excessive <strong>exercise</strong> are associated with amenorrhea. Most cases of amenorrhea associated with exercise are also associated with weight loss, with evidence that normal cycles are maintained when caloric intake is sufficient to match the energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The &quot;female athlete triad&quot; is defined as the presence of amenorrhea, disordered eating, and osteoporosis or osteopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This syndrome is especially common in amenorrhea associated with activities that tend to be associated with low body weight (eg, running, ballet dancing) and sports in which scoring is subjective (eg, figure skating or gymnastics). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothalamic amenorrhea can be caused by <strong>nutritional deficiencies</strong> that are not associated with weight loss or strenuous exercise. As an example, in two studies, the diet and body composition of nonathletic women with hypothalamic amenorrhea and normal body mass index (BMI) were compared with similar women who had regular menstrual cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In contrast with their menstruating counterparts, the women with amenorrhea severely restricted their fat consumption and had lower body fat mass. Another cause of amenorrhea due to nutritional deficiencies is celiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H689400204\" class=\"local\">'Celiac disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional stress and stress induced by illness (eg, myocardial infarction, severe burns) are additional causes of hypothalamic amenorrhea. With severe illness, the hypothalamic GnRH deficiency is transient; the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis recovers once the patient is well.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689399859\"><span class=\"h4\">Role of leptin deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hypothalamic amenorrhea have lower serum concentrations of leptin, a protein derived from adipose tissue, which probably contributes to their low gonadotropin secretion as compared with similar-weight women who have normal menstrual cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The chronic energy deficit and hypoleptinemia seen with hypothalamic amenorrhea are also associated with bone loss and neuroendocrine dysfunction, including abnormalities of the thyroid, growth hormone, and adrenal axes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/12-15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15,17</a>].

This may in part be due to an underlying genetic predisposition in susceptible individuals. A number of gene mutations have been identified in patients with congenital GnRH deficiency; heterozygous mutations in some of the same genes (<em>KAL1</em>, <em>FGFR1</em>, <em>PROKR2</em>, <em>GNRHR</em>) have now been identified in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Women with a history of hypothalamic amenorrhea with a clear precipitant (eating disorder, stress, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight loss) had a better prognosis for recovery than those with no clear precipitant (71 and 29 percent, respectively). Reversal of the inciting factor appeared necessary but not sufficient for recovery (83 percent recovery if the factor was reversed). In a second study of 93 women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, baseline predictors of recovery included a greater BMI, a higher serum androstenedione concentration, and a lower serum cortisol concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689400126\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypothalamic tumors and infiltrative lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothalamic tumors, (eg, craniopharyngiomas, lymphomas) and infiltrative diseases (eg, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, sarcoidosis) may result in decreased GnRH secretion, low or normal serum gonadotropin concentrations, and amenorrhea. However, these lesions are uncommon compared with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. Most women with infiltrative disease of the hypothalamus who have amenorrhea will have one or more neurologic symptoms, such as severe headache, change in personality, or marked mood changes.

Other types of pituitary adenomas and other sellar masses, and other types of pituitary disease, account for the majority of the remaining cases of pituitary origin.

As a result, serum prolactin should be measured in every woman with amenorrhea. The normal range should be consulted for the prolactin assay used, as the upper limit of normal for women of reproductive age can range from 20 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (20 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. Stress, sleep, and intercourse can also raise serum prolactin. Thus, we recommend that serum prolactin be measured at least twice before sellar imaging is ordered, particularly in women with borderline high values (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L])</span>.</p><p>Prolactin appears to cause amenorrhea by suppressing hypothalamic GnRH secretion, leading to low gonadotropin and estradiol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Unlike the other pituitary hormones, prolactin release is mostly controlled by inhibition, primarily by hypothalamic dopamine. The negative regulation by dopamine is so potent that disruption of the pituitary stalk, by trauma or a large tumor, leads to hyperprolactinemia. Several drugs, estrogen, and increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) release due to hypothyroidism can also reversibly stimulate prolactin secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary should, therefore, be performed in any woman with persistent hyperprolactinemia. As a general rule, the serum prolactin concentration correlates with pituitary adenoma size. Thus, a minimal increase in the serum prolactin concentration in a woman with a large tumor suggests that the mass is probably not a lactotroph adenoma.

Most women experience intermittent follicular development, estradiol production, LH surges, ovulation, and menstrual bleeding between months of hypoestrogenemia. When POI is complete, lack of ovarian function leads to estrogen deficiency, endometrial atrophy, and cessation of menstruation. Despite the intermittent ovarian function, conception is rare once a diagnosis of POI has been made.
