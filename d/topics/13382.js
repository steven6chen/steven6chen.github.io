Most patients with intermittent claudication remain stable with medical therapy. When revascularization is indicated, the options are percutaneous interventional procedures and surgical bypass. </p><p>The general indications for revascularization in patients with claudication, and the indications for and outcomes of percutaneous intervention, will be reviewed here. The roles of medical therapy and surgical revascularization for intermittent claudication are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909632859\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of lower extremity pain varies depending on which vessels are involved. The severity of symptoms depends upon the location and degree of stenosis, the collateral circulation, and the vigor of exercise. Claudication of the buttock, hip, or thigh is generally an indication of proximal occlusive disease. Although femoropopliteal occlusive disease is more likely the source of calf claudication, some patients with iliac artery stenosis can have calf claudication as their primary symptom rather than thigh claudication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Claudication'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909615388\"><span class=\"h2\">TASC classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The guideline from the Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Artery Diseases (TASC II) presents a scheme that classifies iliac, femoral, and popliteal lesions as type A, B, C, or D based upon overall success rates of treating the lesion using endovascular or surgical means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are no classifications referable to the tibial vessels. In general, short segments of disease are more likely to be successfully treated with an endovascular intervention compared with long segments of occlusion. The details of the TASC classification are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H909629056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'TASC classification'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519588553\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, endovascular therapy is the treatment of choice for TASC type A lesions, and endovascular treatment is preferred over surgical treatment for type B lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with type C lesions who are not good risk candidates for surgery may also benefit from percutaneous intervention. The patient's comorbidities, fully informed patient preference, and the operator's long-term success rates must be considered when making treatment recommendations for type B and type C lesions. </p><p>Although contrast angiography is typically used to define the anatomy prior to intervention, it carries a risk of acute renal failure that is greatest in patients with renal insufficiency and diabetes, disorders that are common in patients with peripheral artery disease. In such patients, duplex guidance is a safe and effective alternative that avoids the risk of contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR PERCUTANEOUS REVASCULARIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous interventional procedures are useful for providing symptomatic relief in many patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty results in a &quot;controlled&quot; dissection of the arterial media; adjunctive stenting may or may not be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The indications for intervention (surgical or percutaneous intervention) in patients with claudication are discussed elsewhere, but in general, percutaneous intervention can be offered to selected patients whose claudication limits their ability to work or to perform other activities that are important to them, and for those patients who fail (or are predicted to fail) to respond to exercise and pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-claudication#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of claudication&quot;, section on 'Indications for revascularization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication#H50931201\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy'</a>.) </p><p>The initial enthusiasm for percutaneous intervention came from an early randomized trial that showed no significant difference in outcome after a median of four years between percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and bypass surgery for iliac or femoropopliteal PAD in patients with claudication or critical ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The long-term success of percutaneous intervention depends upon the site and length of the lesion. Short, focal stenosis is typically associated with mild-to-moderate symptoms and is effectively treated with interventional therapies. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is also the subset of patients who have the greatest improvement with exercise and medical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With advancements in balloons, stents, and delivery systems, percutaneous intervention can be offered to poor surgical candidates with more extensive PAD, or to attempt limb salvage before resorting to distal surgical bypass. Lesions that display unfavorable anatomy include one or more of the following features; these patterns are more likely to be associated with severe symptoms and reflect more extensive disease that might be better treated surgically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long segment stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal stenoses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eccentric, calcified stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long segment occlusions</p><p/><p>A major concern with intervention in patients with claudication is that some patients may suffer complications that worsen their symptoms. Although the presence of PAD and its severity is an important marker for cardiovascular risk, symptoms of intermittent claudication are associated with only a small risk of progression to limb-threatening lower extremity ischemia or amputation. In-stent restenosis, stent fracture, vessel thrombosis, infection, and embolization are complications of interventions that have been associated with risk of developing limb-threatening ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Since patient symptoms and outcomes of percutaneous intervention are closely related to the anatomic site of disease, each segment of the lower extremity circulation is reviewed separately in the sections below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Aortoiliac occlusive disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Femoropopliteal occlusive disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Infrapopliteal occlusive disease'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84823693\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues to address prior to intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have shown that successful revascularization can substantially improve the patient's quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], but the patient must be able to benefit by improvements in lower extremity blood flow (ie, exercise ability or functional status is not limited by another cause, such as angina, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or orthopedic problems). Thus, before performing any revascularization procedure (percutaneous or surgical) in patients with PAD, cardiovascular society guidelines suggest that the following issues should be addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/2,3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10,11</a>].

Nevertheless, a trial of medical therapy and supervised exercise is still recommended given the effectiveness of supervised exercise. The CLEVER (Claudication: Exercise versus Endoluminal Revascularization) study demonstrated the greatest improvements in walking distance for supervised exercise in patients with iliac stenosis and claudication over stent revascularization or medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Five-year primary patency rates are approximately 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/5,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,17</a>].

Selective stenting is supported by a study that randomly assigned 279 patients with intermittent claudication due to iliac artery stenosis to primary stenting or PTA with adjunctive stenting for a residual mean pressure gradient &gt;10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Initial hemodynamic success and complication rates were similar for primary and adjunctive stenting, and no differences in outcome, including quality of life, were apparent at two years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58444 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although stents have been shown to improve patency, restenosis due to fibrointimal hyperplasia is a frequent occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Mechanical and pharmacological techniques to reduce restenosis are actively being investigated. A small feasibility study has used one such device comprised of a drug-eluting (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>) bioresorbable vascular scaffold to treat iliac or femoral artery lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. At one- and two-year follow-up, binary restenosis rates (&gt;50 percent) were 12.1 and 16.1 percent, respectively, and freedom from target lesion revascularization was 91.2 and 88.2 percent, respectively. There were no procedure-related amputations&nbsp;or deaths at two-year follow-up. Although these results are encouraging, direct comparisons with drug-eluting balloons and drug-eluting polymer coated metal stents are needed.</p><p>In addition to its benefits in focal iliac stenosis, PTA with or without stenting can also produce long-term outcomes similar to surgery in patients with complex or long-segment disease and bilateral iliac occlusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Some authors advocate primary stenting under these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. To evaluate the influence of lesion severity on outcomes of PTA and stenting, a multicenter study in Europe (BRAVISSIMO study) prospectively studied 325 patients undergoing percutaneous intervention of TASC A, B, C, or D aortoiliac lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. The primary endpoint was primary patency at 12 months, defined as a target lesion without a hemodynamically significant stenosis on duplex ultrasound (&gt;50 percent, systolic velocity ratio &ge;2.0), and without target lesion revascularization (TLR) within 12 months. The overall primary patency rate was 93.1 percent. The one-year primary patency rates were 94 percent for TASC A lesions, 96.5 percent for TASC B lesions, 91.3 percent for TASC C lesions, and 90.2 percent for TASC D lesions. There were no significant differences between the TASC groups. </p><p>PTA and stents have also been used to treat stenosis of the aortic bifurcation. To avoid displacement of plaque across the aortic bifurcation during balloon angioplasty or embolization of debris down the contralateral iliac artery, a technique that uses two (&quot;kissing&quot;) balloons positioned simultaneously across both limbs of the aortic bifurcation and inflated in unison can be used. This technique is usually followed by the placement of kissing stents. In one study, stent insertion was successful in all 20 patients; symptoms were improved in 19, 12 of whom became asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a study of 80 patients with stenosis of the aortic bifurcation, primary and assisted primary patency rates at five years were 64.5 and 81.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we use a combination of angioplasty and stenting, depending upon the lesion morphology and location.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common iliac artery stenoses are first angioplastied. If there is a satisfactory result, we stop. However, if there is a flow-limiting dissection or persistent high-grade stenosis associated with a pressure gradient, we recommend the use of stents to improve the long-term patency. The choice of stent is largely a matter of personal choice based on personal experience and local availability, given the wide range of stent materials, geometric designs, delivery systems, and coatings. Balloon-expandable bare metal stents (eg, Palmaz) or covered stents (eg, iCast) are typically used to treat lesions at the origins of the common iliac arteries. Self-expanding bare metal stents (eg, nitinol) or covered stents (eg, Viabahn) are generally preferred for longer segments and for lesions that involve the external iliac arteries. In a multicenter German trial, use of self-expanding stents in the common iliac artery resulted in lower rates of restenosis compared with balloon-expandable stents at 12 months (6.1 versus 14.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcified lesions should be treated with balloon-expandable stents, particularly in the external iliac artery. Covered stents should be used for heavily calcified lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FEMOROPOPLITEAL OCCLUSIVE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The femoropopliteal segment, and in particular the popliteal artery, can be challenging to treat using an endovascular approach because of the mobility of this segment with extremity movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-40</a>]. As with any site, options for revascularization of symptomatic femoropopliteal disease include angioplasty alone, angioplasty with adjunctive stenting, or primary stenting. Primary stenting may be advantageous when managing calcific or long segment lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It is clear that primary patency is improved with the use of self-expanding stents in the superficial femoral artery, but the risk of in-stent restenosis has not been eliminated. </p><p>Several meta-analyses of randomized trials have sought to determine which is preferred, but a clear advantage to primary stenting has not definitively been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included only trials using contemporary flexible nitinol stents (four trials, 627 patients, 665 lesions) and excluding 13 trials using older stents, technical success was significantly higher in the primary stenting group compared with balloon angioplasty (95.8 versus 64.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Freedom from target lesion revascularization at 12 months favored the stent group, but the difference was not significant; however, the 12-month binary restenosis (stenosis &ge;50 percent) rate was significantly lower in the primary stenting group. The mean length of the treated lesion was similar in both groups (75 mm in the stenting group versus 67 mm in the angioplasty group). </p><p>Chronic total occlusion of the superficial femoral artery in patients with claudication has also been treated using a variety of techniques. One retrospective study assessed outcomes in 481 patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia who were treated for 688 chronic total occlusions (193 superior femoral artery [SFA], 67 popliteal, 217 tibial, and 211 multilevel) using angioplasty, angioplasty with stenting, or atherectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. There were no significant differences in primary or secondary patency rates between the various treatments at two years. </p><p>The choice of angioplasty or stenting is a challenge as the optimal approach depends on location, length, and the technology available to the interventionalist performing the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662028803\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) for femoropopliteal disease has a lower long-term patency rate compared with PTA for aortoiliac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Smaller vessel diameter is one possible reason for the higher rate of restenosis at this site. Other anatomic factors that adversely affect long-term patency following PTA of the femoropopliteal segment include long or eccentric calcified lesions, arterial occlusion, and poor distal runoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. </p><p>Balloon angioplasty in the femoropopliteal segment is associated with high rates of reocclusion and restenosis. In multiple studies, long-term outcomes after intervention are not significantly improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/50-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-55</a>]. As an example, one prospective study evaluated the effectiveness of femoropopliteal PTA in patients with claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The overall technical success rate was 88 percent; successful angioplasty was somewhat higher for stenosis (91 percent) compared with occlusion (83 percent). Two-year patency rates ranged from 42 to 58 percent. Loss of initial patency is most often due to restenosis, which usually occurs in the first six months, or to progressive atherosclerosis at the lesion site or elsewhere in the same vessel. Interestingly, repeat PTA has equivalent patency rates to initial PTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143101018\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug-eluting balloons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of medical therapies aimed at preventing restenosis after femoral PTA have been tried, but only local delivery of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> has been shown to improve outcomes.

Medical management of claudication is the first line of treatment and includes a program of regular exercise, and pharmacologic treatment. (See <a href=\"#H909632859\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication#H50931201\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous intervention can be offered to selected patients with disabling symptoms that limit their ability to work or to perform other activities that are important to them and failure (or predicted failure) to respond to exercise and pharmacologic therapy. We also consider percutaneous intervention in some cases to augment a surgical procedure.

In general, endovascular therapy is the treatment of choice for TASC type A lesions, and endovascular treatment is preferred over surgical treatment for type B lesions. Patients with type C lesions who are not good risk candidates for surgery may also benefit from percutaneous intervention. The patient's comorbidities, fully informed patient preference, and the operator's long-term success rates must be considered when making treatment recommendations for type B and type C lesions. Open reconstruction is generally preferred, when indicated, for TASC D lesions.
