Endometrioid carcinoma is the most common histologic subtype and typically presents at an early stage with abnormal uterine bleeding. It is associated with a good prognosis. Other histologic types of endometrial carcinoma (eg, serous, clear cell) may not present with uterine bleeding and are typically diagnosed at more advanced stages. As a result, these other types are associated with a poorer prognosis. </p><p>The stage at diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 1</a>) and histologic subtype of endometrial carcinoma are used to assign risk for recurrent or persistent disease into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk. This review will focus on adjuvant treatment for patients with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. An overview of endometrial cancer, including clinical features and an approach to diagnosis, an overview on the approach to adjuvant treatment, and treatment of low- and high-risk and advanced endometrial cancer are discussed separately. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endometrial carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to adjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-treatment-of-high-risk-endometrial-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant treatment of high-risk endometrial cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596987971\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF INTERMEDIATE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgical staging is complete, intermediate-risk patients are defined by the following: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer confined to the uterus and invading the myometrium (a subset of stage IA or stage IB) or cancer that demonstrates occult cervical stromal invasion (stage II). These groups have a higher risk of recurrence than do patients whose tumors are confined to the endometrium. However, this excludes women with serous or clear cell cancers, which are considered to be high-risk histologic types regardless of the stage at presentation. These tumors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-treatment-of-high-risk-endometrial-cancers#H181148975\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant treatment of high-risk endometrial cancers&quot;, section on 'Uterine serous or clear cell carcinoma'</a>.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subset of women are considered to have high intermediate-risk based on certain pathologic criteria: &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) defines high intermediate-risk based on age and any of three pathologic factors: the presence of deep myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 histology, or the presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women have high intermediate-risk disease if they are: &ge;70 years with one risk factor, age 50 to 69 years with two risk factors, or age &ge;18 years with all three risk factors. In the GOG 99 trial, two-thirds of all recurrences were in women who met these pathologic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, the Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC) trials define high intermediate-risk by two of three clinicopathologic factors present: age &gt;60 years, outer half myometrial invasion, and grade 3 histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In the PORTEC-1 trial, women who underwent observation had a higher rate of relapse in the pelvis if these criteria were met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Notably, the highest-risk groups for recurrence (eg, grade 3, outer half myometrial invasion) were not eligible for treatment on this trial. </p><p/><p>We use the GOG criteria to define the high intermediate-risk group, but either set of criteria is being used to determine clinical trial eligibility. (See <a href=\"#H1596988128\" class=\"local\">'Combined-modality treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of the criteria for high intermediate-risk, all others are considered to have low intermediate-risk endometrial cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5418407\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower uterine segment involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of cancer within the lower uterine segment (LUS) may identify patients at risk for nodal involvement, although whether it represents an independent risk factor for survival is unclear. We do not consider LUS involvement an intermediate-risk factor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596988020\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adjuvant treatment options for women with intermediate-risk disease include observation or radiation therapy (RT). Our approach depends on whether or not risk factors are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest observation following surgery rather than RT for women with low intermediate-risk disease because they have a good prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risks of adjuvant RT outweigh the survival benefits in this population. (See <a href=\"#H215726495\" class=\"local\">'Low intermediate risk'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest RT rather than observation for women with high intermediate-risk disease. These patients are at an increased risk of a local recurrence, and this risk is significantly reduced with adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, adjuvant RT does not appear to impact overall survival (OS). (See <a href=\"#H1596988042\" class=\"local\">'High intermediate-risk disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a lack of data to inform the role of adjuvant chemotherapy (alone or in combination with RT) in women with high intermediate-risk disease. Some experts prefer to offer chemotherapy to women with a subset of high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer (ie, grade 3, &gt;50 percent myometrial invasion, with evidence of lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI]). The use of combined-modality treatment is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H1596988128\" class=\"local\">'Combined-modality treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The evidence to support these recommendations is discussed below.<br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215726495\"><span class=\"h2\">Low intermediate risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with low intermediate-risk disease, we suggest observation rather than adjuvant RT. Given the overall good prognosis of these patients following surgical treatment, there is very little benefit to be gained from adjuvant RT. This was demonstrated in Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 99 (GOG 99), which randomly assigned 448 women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer to observation or adjuvant pelvic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The administration of adjuvant pelvic RT resulted in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower incidence of first recurrence compared with observation only (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46, <strong>90%</strong> CI 0.19-1.11), which was not statistically significant. There was no difference in the incidence of distant recurrence (1.5 versus 1.4 percent, HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.42-3.85).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in the risk of death due to endometrial cancer (HR for mortality 1.04, <strong>90%</strong> CI 0.56-1.93). However, the overall incidence of death was low (3 versus 2 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly higher number of patients with moderate to serious (grade 2 to 4) toxicity, including hematologic (14 versus 5 percent), gastrointestinal (64 versus 5 percent), and cutaneous toxicity (15 versus 9 percent). There were also six patients treated with RT who experienced a serious gastrointestinal obstruction compared with one patient in the observation arm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596988042\"><span class=\"h2\">High intermediate-risk disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with high intermediate-risk disease, we suggest RT rather than observation. RT can reduce the risk of a local recurrence, although it does not appear to improve OS. In a 2012 meta-analysis that evaluated the role of adjuvant RT among women with stage I endometrial cancer, there was no significant difference in OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.63-1.22) or endometrial cancer-specific survival (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>However, the benefit of adjuvant RT for lowering the risk of a local recurrence was demonstrated in GOG 99 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pelvic RT resulted in a reduction in the risk of a local recurrence compared with observation (2 versus 9 percent, HR 0.42, 90% CI 0.21-0.83). Despite this, there was no statistically significant reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.73, 90% CI 0.43-1.26), although the study was not powered sufficiently for this endpoint. </p><p>Because of the apparent lack of a significant OS advantage with adjuvant RT, some experts prefer not to administer adjuvant RT in this population. However, others prefer to administer adjuvant chemotherapy. The role of chemotherapy or concomitant chemotherapy plus RT specifically for women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1596988092\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1596988128\" class=\"local\">'Combined-modality treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>The evidence to support these recommendations is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568079343\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT can be administered as vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), pelvic RT, and in specialized centers, using intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). </p><p>We recommend vaginal brachytherapy for the treatment of women with high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. While pelvic RT decreases the risk of a local recurrence, it is associated with more toxicity, including long-term urinary and bowel symptoms. IMRT is an attractive alternative to VBT, but is not yet widely available. A discussion on the technical aspects of RT for endometrial cancer is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19343690\"><span class=\"h4\">Vaginal brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer VBT alone for most patients with high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer because it results in equivalent locoregional recurrence rates compared with pelvic RT and has a more favorable toxicity profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-12</a>]. In the Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC)-2 trial, 427 women with high intermediate-risk disease were randomly assigned treatment with VBT or pelvic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At 45 months, there were no statistically significant differences between VBT and pelvic RT in terms of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locoregional recurrence rate (5 versus 3 percent for VBT and pelvic RT, respectively)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distant metastases (8 versus 6 percent, respectively)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five-year disease-free survival (83 versus 78 percent, respectively) and OS (85 versus 80 percent, respectively)</p><p/><p>Of note, VBT was associated with a significantly lower rate of treatment-related diarrhea and other bowel symptoms (13 versus 54 percent, respectively). In longer-term follow-up (seven years), patients receiving pelvic RT reported more bowel symptoms with impact on daily activities, and a trend for more urinary symptoms, although impact on overall quality of life was not affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is typically accomplished using high dose rate (HDR) therapy with an iridium-192 source, but also can be delivered using a low dose rate (LDR). Treatment is initiated three to six weeks following surgery, although some experts prefer to wait up to nine weeks to reduce the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence. VBT consists of three to five fractions given once or twice weekly on an outpatient basis. In general, the upper one-half to upper two-thirds of the vagina is treated; either vaginal ovoids or a vaginal cylinder can be used as applicators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54105 \">picture 1</a>). The prescription dose depends upon the number of fractions and dose specification point (to the vaginal mucosa or to a depth of 5 mm), and several published fractionation schedules are accepted. One of the more common dose fractionation schedules employed is three once-weekly fractions of 7 Gy each, delivered to a depth of 5 mm from the vaginal mucosal surface.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215726707\"><span class=\"h4\">Pelvic radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As demonstrated in the PORTEC trial, pelvic RT results in a significant reduction in the risk of a locoregional recurrence compared with surgery alone (5 versus 14 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H378527123\" class=\"local\">'Unstaged intermediate-risk patients'</a> below.) </p><p>However, pelvic RT is associated with both early and late complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,16</a>]. Early gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (eg, diarrhea or rectal bleeding) may occur in up to 60 percent of women, and severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> complications can be seen in up to 8 percent of patients. In addition, in the PORTEC study, the rate of late complications (predominantly affecting the GI and urinary systems) was significantly higher in the group treated with RT compared with those who underwent observation (26 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiation therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Planning and delivery techniques require the use of a standard four-field beam arrangement. Care should be taken to ensure that the vaginal cuff and all locoregionally-draining lymphatics are included in the treatment fields. The typical dose in this setting is 45 to 50.4 Gy given in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy fractions over five to six weeks. Treatment generally is initiated six weeks after surgery to allow for adequate wound healing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215726916\"><span class=\"h4\">Intensity-modulated radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about long-term toxicities and the lack of a survival advantage with pelvic RT in women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer have led to exploration of alternative modalities of treatment, such as IMRT. Unlike conventional RT, the prescription dose used in IMRT is conformed to the target tissue in three dimensions, thereby reducing the dose of RT delivered to normal surrounding tissue. Preliminary experience with IMRT has been promising, with low rates of both acute and chronic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, its use is limited to centers specialized in IMRT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596988092\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are low quality data that adjuvant chemotherapy is an alternative to RT in women with high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer to justify the morbidity of treatment. </p><p>In one trial, 425 women with endometrial cancer that had at least 50 percent myometrial invasion were randomly assigned to treatment with whole pelvic RT versus three or more courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (CAP) chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. CAP was not associated with any improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) or OS. However, among women with high intermediate-risk disease (grade 3 endometrial cancer, cervical stromal invasion, or cases with positive peritoneal cytology), CAP resulted in an improvement in the five-year rate of PFS (84 versus 66 percent, HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.97) and OS (90 versus 74 percent, HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.69). </p><p>Further data are needed before chemotherapy can be administered instead of RT in women with high intermediate-risk disease. We encourage participation in appropriately designed clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H1596988128\" class=\"local\">'Combined-modality treatment'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596988128\"><span class=\"h3\">Combined-modality treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because RT reduces the risk of a locoregional recurrence but does not address the risk of distant recurrence, there is interest in use of a combined approach of chemotherapy plus some form of RT. However, there are no high quality data to inform the risks and benefits of treatment for all women with high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]. Some data suggest that the addition of chemotherapy may improve outcomes for women considered to be at the highest risk of distant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal recurrence (ie, outer one-third myometrial invasion, grade 3, and the presence of LVSI). Therefore, it is our practice to offer chemotherapy to these women. If administered, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> for three to four cycles plus VBT. </p><p>The data to support the use of combined-modality treatment come from a 2011 meta-analysis that evaluated the role of adjuvant chemotherapy after hysterectomy for endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-intermediate-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When the analysis was limited to trials that evaluated RT with or without the administration of a platinum-based combination chemotherapy, there was trend towards an improvement in OS (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-1.06) and a significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.89) associated with the use of chemotherapy. Despite these results, the eligibility of these studies was not restricted to early-stage endometrial cancer; indeed, these trials recruited a larger proportion of more advanced-stage patients. Therefore, we utilize these data to support our use of chemotherapy in women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer with risk factors that place them at the highest risk of recurrence. </p><p>Combined-modality treatment (VBT followed by chemotherapy) versus pelvic RT for women with intermediate-risk disease and high-risk early-stage disease is also evaluated in the randomized trial <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00807768&amp;token=YbJELcAW9G3aZfZrjTwgljvGy8B5W5sYbMw5bZWXTZm4l/G5Na5+P/Wpgfegb6a0Z7BgMc6UlM16kTdGPRZHMg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16741\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GOG 249</a>, which is covered separately.

Therefore, many patients undergo adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk in the pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H1596987936\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate-risk patients are those with endometrial carcinomas invading the myometrium (a subset of stage IA or stage IB) or demonstrating occult cervical stromal invasion (stage II). These groups have a higher risk of recurrence than do patients whose tumors are confined to the endometrium. Several prognostic factors are used to stratify women into a high intermediate-risk endometrial group. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) uses the following risk factors: older age, outer half myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 differentiation, or the presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) within the cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1596987971\" class=\"local\">'Definition of intermediate risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women without high-risk prognostic factors (ie, low intermediate-risk disease), we recommend observation over adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H215726495\" class=\"local\">'Low intermediate risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women with high intermediate-risk endometrial cancer, we suggest RT rather than observation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We recommend vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) rather than pelvic RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In general, we suggest not administering adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1596988042\" class=\"local\">'High intermediate-risk disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19343690\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal brachytherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer with clinical features associated with the highest risk of recurrence (ie, grade 3 tumor, outer-third myometrial invasion, and LVSI), we suggest VBT followed by chemotherapy rather than VBT alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In our practice, we utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> for three to four cycles.
