During much of pregnancy, AF is derived almost entirely from the fetus and has a number of functions that are essential for normal growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It helps to protect the fetus from trauma to the maternal abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It cushions the umbilical cord from compression between the fetus and uterus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has antibacterial properties that provide some protection from infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It serves as a reservoir of fluid and nutrients for the fetus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It provides the necessary fluid, space, and growth factors to permit normal development of the fetal lungs and musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems.</p><p/><p>Aberrations in amniotic fluid volume (AFV), both low (oligohydramnios) and high (polyhydramnios), are associated with a multitude of pregnancy-related problems. For example, one study examined the pregnancy outcome of 147 women with a sonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios (AF index &lt;5 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Compared with women with AF index &gt;5 cm, these pregnancies had an increased incidence of labor induction (42 versus 18 percent), stillbirth (1.4 versus 0.3 percent), nonreassuring fetal heart rate (48 versus 39 percent), admission to the neonatal intensive care nursery (7 versus 2 percent), meconium aspiration syndrome (1 versus 0.1 percent), and neonatal death (5 versus 0.3 percent). Another study assessed the adverse effects of persistent polyhydramnios in 65 women and reported increased rates of both maternal problems (eg, diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension) and obstetrical complications (eg, preterm delivery, abnormal fetal presentation, fetal anomalies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review basic physiological mechanisms responsible for both AFV and AF composition. This knowledge is required to understand the causes and consequences of AFV disorders and to devise effective management strategies for pregnancies with these disorders. Current knowledge in these areas is limited, but progress is being made. Detailed discussions of assessment of AFV, oligohydramnios, and polyhydramnios can be found separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-amniotic-fluid-volume\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of amniotic fluid volume&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligohydramnios\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligohydramnios&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyhydramnios\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyhydramnios&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF AMNIOTIC FLUID</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2704821472\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several sources that produce AF (see below); the relative contribution from each source changes across gestation. Knowledge of the sources of amniotic fluid can assist the investigation of patients with abnormalities of AFV. In the absence of ruptured membranes, oligohydramnios in the second half of pregnancy is most often a result of decreased fetal urine flow; possible causes include obstruction of the urinary tract and decreased fetal renal blood flow related to fetal growth restriction. Maternal dehydration can lead to a reduction in placental water flow and, in turn, decreased AFV. In contrast, reductions in fetal lung fluid flow are not etiologic in oligohydramnios. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligohydramnios#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligohydramnios&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Polyhydramnios may be associated with maternal diabetes or with increased fetal urine flow due to fetal tachyarrhythmia with heart failure, severe anemia, or isolated fetal polyuria with Bartter syndrome, among others. A reduction in fetal swallowing due to a high gastrointestinal obstruction or fetal neurologic abnormalities may be associated with severe polyhydramnios. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyhydramnios#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyhydramnios&quot;, section on 'Conditions associated with polyhydramnios'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Early gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two fluid sacs that surround the embryo during early pregnancy: the amniotic sac containing AF and the exocoelomic cavity containing coelomic fluid (ie, extraembryonic coelomic fluid). These sacs contain large amounts of liquid relative to the size of the <span class=\"nowrap\">embryo/fetus</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Coelomic fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coelomic fluid is present between the developing chorionic and amniotic membranes beginning at about the 7th week of gestation, reaching a maximal volume around the 10th week, and then decreasing in amount until it completely disappears at 12 to 14 weeks of gestation, thus enabling fusion of the amniotic and chorionic membranes. The source and mechanisms that regulate the volume and composition of coelomic fluid have not been investigated directly, although the quantity and composition of this fluid have been described extensively, particularly in regard to potential biochemical markers for fetal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>The composition of coelomic fluid is similar to maternal plasma and different from AF, suggesting that maternal plasma may be its source. However, a pathway for movement of fluid from maternal plasma to the exocoelomic cavity has not been defined. Endometrial gland secretions may be one source.</p><p>The cause of the disappearance of coelomic fluid is unknown. It is likely that solutes and fluid from the exocoelomic cavity cross the amniotic membrane into the AF and that coelomic fluid is an early source of AF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Amniotic fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of AF increases prior to the transition from the embryonic to fetal period at 10 weeks of gestation. Early pregnancy AF is likely derived from three sources:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetal surface of the placenta</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport from the maternal compartment across the amnion (transmembranous)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secretions from the surface of the body of the embryo.</p><p/><p>The relative contributions of these potential sources are unknown. Both coelomic and amniotic fluids are present in anembryonic pregnancies, indicating that the fetus may not be the primary fluid source in early pregnancy. It is clear, however, that important late gestational sources of AF (fetal urine and lung liquid) do not contribute to the AFV in early gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mid gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal urine begins to enter the amniotic sac and the fetus begins to swallow AF in conjunction with the transition from the embryonic to fetal period at 10 weeks of gestation, although the daily volume flows are quite small at mid gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The fetal lungs also begin to secrete liquid into the AF at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Late gestation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1017195485\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of production and clearance pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abundant human and animal data are available regarding the source and composition of AF during the latter half of gestation. The developing human fetus becomes sufficiently large near term to allow noninvasive methods (eg, ultrasound) to estimate AF volumes and flows; in addition, direct measurements in chronically catheterized ovine fetuses can be conducted at this time. There appear to be two major sources for both AF production and clearance near term:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Production &mdash; Fetal urine and fetal lung liquid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance &mdash; Fetal swallowing and intramembranous pathway.</p><p/><p>The &ldquo;intramembranous pathway&rdquo; refers to water and solute exchange that occurs directly between AF and fetal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. This occurs primarily across microscopic fetal vessels present on the fetal surface of the placenta in primates and over the whole membrane surface in species with vascularized membranes. Smaller contributions may occur across the umbilical cord and fetal skin; however, transcutaneous flow ceases with skin keratinization at 22 to 24 weeks of gestation. Aquaporins (cell membrane water channel proteins) in the chorioamniotic membrane and placenta may play a role in intramembranous fluid resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The minor sources of AF production and clearance at this time include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Production &mdash; Secretions from the fetal oral-nasal cavities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance &mdash; Transmembranous pathway.</p><p/><p>The &ldquo;transmembranous pathway&rdquo; refers to water and solute exchange between AF and maternal blood across the decidua and myometrium. In contrast to intramembranous flow, which occurs from one fetal compartment to another, transmembranous flow takes place between maternal and fetal compartments. Transmembranous water and solute fluxes are immeasurably small, although these exchanges were once considered major contributors to AFV and composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Both the transmembranous and intramembranous pathways permit flow of water and solutes in opposite directions (ie, osmotic flow of water and diffusion of solutes), while the other pathways only allow flow of water and solutes in the same direction (ie, bulk flow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Aside from transmembranous flow, all AFV ultimately derives from water flow across the placenta from mother to fetus. Alterations in maternal hydration can result in changes in AFV, presumably due to changes in transplacental water flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Daily fetal urine excretion and fetal swallowing are the best-described processes for AF production and clearance. However, there remain major differences in the magnitude of current estimates of human fetal urine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3139600187\"><span class=\"h3\">Estimated daily amniotic volume flows</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe the best estimates of daily amniotic volume flows in the near term fetus are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal urine production &mdash; 800 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal lung liquid secretion &mdash; 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal swallowing &mdash; 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramembranous flow &mdash;200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral-nasal secretions &mdash; 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmembranous flow &mdash;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span>.</p><p/><p>These values are experimentally derived, in many cases using animal models. Specific sources of production and clearance are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal urination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The daily volume of fetal urine excreted is approximately 30 percent of fetal body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hourly flow rates progressively increase from 2 to 5 mL at 22 weeks of gestation to 30 to 50 mL at 40 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The reduction in maternal plasma sodium concentration (about 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> during pregnancy may increase the fetal urine output and contribute to AF formation by enhancing osmotic flow of water across the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Variations in the estimated urine flow may be partially explained by maternal position when the measurement is obtained; maternal rest in the left lateral decubitus position markedly increases fetal urine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another factor affecting flow rate is the time before onset of labor; hourly fetal urine production is reduced in the 14 days prior to delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Fetal urinary flow rates decrease with conditions associated with placental insufficiency (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction) and increase with conditions associated with cardiac failure (eg, fetal anemia, supraventricular tachycardia, twin-twin transfusion syndrome). Fetal urination (and therefore AFV) is also adversely affected by obstructions in the fetal urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal lung secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal lung secretes 100 times as much fluid as is needed to expand the developing lungs to facilitate their growth. The excess fluid exits the trachea, primarily during episodes of fetal breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of this fluid (170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> near term) is swallowed and the remainder enters the AF compartment, which is the basis for fetal lung maturity testing from AF measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Lung fluid secretion is reduced during periods of fetal asphyxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fetal lung fluid production also ceases during labor and fluid is absorbed into the pulmonary lymphatics. In contrast, there are no disease states in which fetal lung fluid secretion is increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal swallowing increases throughout gestation. Although swallowing-type movements can be noted by ultrasound late in the first trimester, these movements do not become well-coordinated until the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Direct and indirect measurements of ovine fetal swallowing suggest that the fetus swallows AF equivalent to 20 to 25 percent of body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] The volumes swallowed are significantly greater than in adults, relative to body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Low rates of swallowing compared to fetal urination in early and midpregnancy account for the gradual increase in AFV during this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In contrast, increased swallowing near term, and especially postterm, may contribute to the fall in AFV at the end of pregnancy. </p><p>Fetal swallowing is decreased with a consequent increase in AFV in some fetuses with neurologic abnormalities, such as anencephaly. Fetal swallowing may be also be impaired by obstruction in the fetal esophagus or duodenum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Intramembranous flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intramembranous flow is thought to be largely driven by the large osmotic gradient between fetal plasma and AF. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Amniotic fluid osmolality, sodium, and chloride'</a> below.) The normal intramembranous flow rate has been calculated only in fetal sheep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/9,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29</a>]. Changes in AF osmolality were measured over time in sheep with tracheoesophageal occlusion and continuous urinary drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This preparation eliminated all major flows into and out of the amniotic cavity, except for the intramembranous path. Half of the normal osmolality gradient between AF and fetal blood disappeared in eight hours, suggesting that 400 mL of water per day was absorbed via this route.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral-nasal secretions and transmembranous flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These pathways account for small volumes of fluid exchange. They are difficult to measure and have not been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">AMNIOTIC FLUID OSMOLALITY, SODIUM, AND CHLORIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The composition of AF reflects a combination of fetal lung liquid and fetal urine, both fluids with properties different from fetal plasma. The composition of AF is distinctively different from that of all other fetal and maternal fluids.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osmolality</strong> &ndash; Fetal and maternal blood osmolalities are equivalent across gestation. Starting in the early fetal period, AF osmolality is slightly lower than that of fetal blood and decreases further as the pregnancy progresses. AF osmolality averages 260 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> at term compared with a blood osmolality of 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span>. Fetal urine osmolality is usually 50 to 60 percent of AF osmolality, although the near-term fetus can alter its urine volume and osmolality in response to fetal hormonal signals such as vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Lung liquid osmolality is similar to that of fetal plasma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sodium</strong> &ndash; The AF sodium concentration is much lower than that of fetal blood. The fetal urinary sodium concentration is low, averaging 20 to 40 percent of AF concentrations. By comparison, fetal lung liquid sodium concentration is only modestly lower than blood sodium concentration and, thus is significantly higher than that in the AF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chloride</strong> &ndash; Lung liquid chloride concentration is almost twice the AF chloride concentration because lung secretion is driven by the active secretion of chloride into the future airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Fetal urinary chloride concentration is very low, 10 to 20 percent of the AF chloride concentration.</p><p/><p>Minor constituents of AF have been studied in an attempt to find biochemical markers predicting fetal condition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pending labor and delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. There is little consensus in these areas, except for the prediction of fetal lung maturity (AF surfactant) and open neural tube defects (AF alpha-fetoprotein).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT REGULATES THE SOURCES OF AMNIOTIC FLUID PRODUCTION AND CLEARANCE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, fetal urination, lung liquid secretion, fetal swallowing, and intramembranous absorption make significant contributions to fluid movements into and out of the AF sac in late gestation. The integration of all fluid inflows and outflows determines the ultimate volume of AF. Although many reviews have addressed the topic of AFV regulation, no study has proven if and how this occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. For AFV self-regulation to occur, there must be a feedback mechanism to detect aberrations in AFV and return volume toward normal. These issues will be addressed by first considering normal AFV turnover and then discussing possible volume regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>The AFV does not change significantly from day to day, but the AF itself is completely replaced. In the third trimester 1000 mL of fluid flows into and out of the amniotic cavity daily so that even small changes in one of the paths of fluid migration could rapidly affect AFV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conversely, regulation of AFV must be precise to maintain normal volumes with such high flow rates. If AFV is self-regulated in the latter half of gestation, then this must occur through adjustment of one or more of the four primary AF inflows and outflows (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Late gestation'</a> above).</p><p>Variations in fetal homeostasis affect the volume of fetal urine production, swallowing, and lung liquid secretion. In this respect, the AFV is a passive reflector of the fetal condition. This is illustrated by the fetus with decreased renal blood flow, which leads to decreased urine production and oligohydramnios, or the anomalous fetus that cannot swallow due to gut atresia, resulting in polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Maternal disease also affects fetal homeostasis, and, in turn, AFV. Maternal dehydration increases maternal osmolality, favoring transfer of water from the fetus to the mother, which, in turn, promotes transfer of water from the AF to the fetus, presumably via the intramembranous pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Likewise, maternal hyperglycemia can lead to increased fetal urine output and polyhydramnios. These types of alterations in AFV are presumably pathologic, and these mechanisms are not likely to be involved in normal fluid homeostasis.</p><p>Variations in intramembranous flow may be an important mechanism for AFV homeostasis. The functional importance of the intramembranous absorption pathway was illustrated in a study in which surgical manipulation of fetal sheep resulted in intramembranous flow as the sole means of AF absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. AF inflow by urine production was augmented for six days with an intraamniotic infusion of Ringer's solution. During the period of Ringer's infusion, only one of six fetuses developed hydramnios as intramembranous absorption of AF increased by more than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span>. The authors concluded that intramembranous absorption of AF increased to maintain normal AFV in response to an excessive inflow of exogenous fluid.</p><p>The mechanism whereby intramembranous absorption of water and solutes regulate AFV and maintains homeostasis is largely unknown. It is also unknown whether the volume of AF is actively regulated by the fetus. However, studies in sheep suggest active regulation of AFV through changes in intramembranous flow and suggest aquaporin water channels (AQPs) as the means for this regulation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated the effects of esophageal ligation on AFV and urinary flow in fetal sheep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Despite the absence of fetal swallowing, polyhydramnios did not occur and AFV actually decreased by 60 percent. The authors concluded that intramembranous absorption increased to two to three times normal levels to prevent polyhydramnios. The mechanisms increasing intramembranous absorption remain in doubt. The authors suggested that fetal urine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lung secretions may contain factors, such as VEGF, that increase intramembranous permeability. Their subsequent experiments, however, found no effect of lung secretions on the rate of intramembranous absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, intravascular infusion of large volumes of saline into ovine fetuses resulted in large increases in urinary flow though AFV role only slightly. The authors calculated a marked increase in intramembranous absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p>Intramembranous absorption, and therefore AFV, may be associated with changes in the expression of AQPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>] in the placenta and fetal membranes. AQPs are a family of cell membrane water channels found ubiquitously in tissues. Multiple AQPs are currently known; AQP 1, 3, 8, 9, and 11 have been described in the placenta and fetal membranes of humans, sheep, and mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In an ovine model, AQP1 protein increased in the amnion of late-gestation fetal sheep under experimental conditions that increased intramembranous flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], suggesting that AQP 1 could be involved in regulating intramembranous flow, and therefore AFV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In humans, one report found an increased expression of aquaporin 8 in the placenta and membranes of fetuses with polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Similarly, another group found expression of AQP 8 and 9 to be increased in the amnion and decreased in the placenta in patients with idiopathic polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Fetuses with oligohydramnios demonstrated decreased expression of aquaporins 1 and 3 in the membranes, and increased aquaporin 3 in the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p>Together, the evidence indicates the potential for alteration in intramembranous flow, particularly when increased AFV occurs. Although the signal for this alteration is not yet known, it is likely that membrane and placental AQPs contribute importantly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL AMNIOTIC FLUID VOLUME ACROSS GESTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few studies that have measured AFV across gestation, however, the available data describe a characteristic pattern of AFV change (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59704 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 705 normal pregnancies from 12 studies between 1962 and 1977, AFV was observed to increase progressively from eight weeks of gestation, peak at 34 weeks (at over 800 mL), and decline thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The largest variability in AFV occurred in the third trimester, probably due to greater variation in fetal urination and swallowing later in pregnancy. The use of several different dye-dilution techniques and failure to subtract blood contamination from the collections of AF at the time of hysterotomy were limitations of this analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study of 144 pregnancies performed all of the fluid evaluations using the same dye-dilution technique and a single laboratory for the calculation of the AFV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. AFV increased well into the third trimester of pregnancy, with the most significant increase after 30 weeks and until term.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of four studies with 1095 total patients evaluated by direct evaluation of the AFV, the maximum AFV was at 30 to 31 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>The two earlier studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>] found that AFV at 36 weeks of gestation was approximately 800 mL, but they differed as to whether the volume remained stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] or decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] at term. Potential selection bias, methodologic differences, and limited numbers of patients studied prevent a firm conclusion regarding the normal change in AFV between 30 and 40 weeks. Nevertheless, beyond 40 weeks it is likely that mean AFV decreases, with a marked reduction in postterm patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotic fluid (AF) is crucial to normal fetal growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second half of pregnancy, AF is produced by the fetus as urine and lung liquid, and resorbed by fetal swallowing. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Late gestation'</a> above.) An additional pathway for AF resorption is the intramembranous pathway: across the amnion into fetal vessels on the surface of the placenta. The rate of fluid resorption through the intramembranous pathway changes to maintain normal amniotic fluid volume (AVF) in experimental models; mechanisms for this change are speculative. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Intramembranous flow'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AF volume increases in human gestation until 34 to 36 weeks of gestation. Subsequently, until term, fluid volumes do not increase and may decrease. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Normal amniotic fluid volume across gestation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variations in fetal homeostasis, caused by a variety of fetal and maternal conditions, affect the volume of AF by alterations in fetal urine production, swallowing, and (possibly) lung liquid secretion. Thus, AFV is a passive reflector of the fetal condition. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'What regulates the sources of amniotic fluid production and clearance?'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brace RA.
