She was started on insulin then and has been on insulin ever since, currently taking NPH insulin 20 units every morning and using a sliding scale of aspart insulin sporadically. Her blood glucose values are variable when checked twice a day, before breakfast and before dinner. Most fasting blood glucose values are in the 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 to 16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range, but some are in the 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 to 3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range. Blood glucose values before supper vary from 44 to 327 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.4 to 18.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> with no apparent pattern. She is having occasional nocturnal insulin reactions. The glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is 10.20 percent. The patient says she counts carbohydrates and avoids concentrated sweets. She is 5' 1&quot; tall, weighs 111 pounds, and has a body mass index (BMI) of 21.</p><p>What do you recommend?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 1200-calorie diet to reduce variability in the blood glucose levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interactive-diabetes-case-6-uncontrolled-diabetes-in-a-64-year-old-woman-treated-with-insulin-a1\" class=\"medical medical_answer\">&quot;Interactive diabetes case 6: Uncontrolled diabetes in a 64-year-old woman treated with insulin - A1&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> 500 mg orally twice a day before meals to reduce the peak glucose values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interactive-diabetes-case-6-uncontrolled-diabetes-in-a-64-year-old-woman-treated-with-insulin-a2\" class=\"medical medical_answer\">&quot;Interactive diabetes case 6: Uncontrolled diabetes in a 64-year-old woman treated with insulin - A2&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sliding scale of aspart insulin at breakfast based on the carbohydrate intake at that time to reduce fluctuations in the blood glucose level later in the day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interactive-diabetes-case-6-uncontrolled-diabetes-in-a-64-year-old-woman-treated-with-insulin-a3\" class=\"medical medical_answer\">&quot;Interactive diabetes case 6: Uncontrolled diabetes in a 64-year-old woman treated with insulin - A3&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A redistribution of insulin. You reduce the morning dose of NPH insulin to 10 units before breakfast and add NPH insulin 4 units at bedtime. You also add a dose of aspart insulin before supper, based on the patient's estimated insulin to carbohydrate ratio of one unit for every 25 grams of carbohydrate and correction factor of one unit for every 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> of blood glucose above 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interactive-diabetes-case-6-uncontrolled-diabetes-in-a-64-year-old-woman-treated-with-insulin-a4\" class=\"medical medical_answer\">&quot;Interactive diabetes case 6: Uncontrolled diabetes in a 64-year-old woman treated with insulin - A4&quot;</a>).
