The term, AKI, has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF), reflecting the recognition that smaller declines in kidney function that do not result in overt organ failure are of substantial clinical relevance and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p>AKI during pregnancy can be caused by any of the disorders leading to AKI in the general population. There are also, however, pregnancy complications characteristic of each trimester that can be associated with kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This topic reviews causes of AKI that are most commonly encountered during pregnancy. Causes of AKI in the general population are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;, section on 'Major causes and pathogenesis of kidney disease'</a>.)</p><p>Nephrolithiasis during pregnancy is discussed elsewhere.

Several consensus definitions of AKI have been developed for use in the general population in order to provide a uniform, quantitative definition of AKI. These include the RIFLE and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definitions and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) modifications of the AKIN definition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;, section on 'Major causes and pathogenesis of kidney disease'</a>.)</p><p>However, it is not clear that the consensus criteria for AKI are useful in pregnancy. This is because, during pregnancy, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases significantly (by approximately 50 percent), resulting in a lower baseline serum creatinine compared with similarly healthy, nonpregnant individuals (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;, section on 'Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate disconnect in late gestation'</a>). Most obstetricians do not routinely check the serum creatinine either prior to or early in pregnancy. Thus, seemingly &quot;normal&quot; serum creatinine levels (eg, 0.7 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> may represent significant increases from baseline, which may not be appreciated at the time of presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8556472\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI during pregnancy is uncommon in the developed world. The true incidence is difficult to estimate because of varying diagnostic criteria. Most reviews estimate that, in countries with adequate antenatal care, only approximately 1 in 20,000 pregnancies are affected by AKI severe enough to require renal replacement therapy (RRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence may be considerably higher in countries where antenatal care is less available and where illegal abortions are performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although some single-center series from India and Africa report an incidence as high as 10 to 20 percent, a series from Egypt reported an incidence of AKI requiring dialysis of only 0.6 percent of 5600 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8556466\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of AKI during pregnancy depend on the trimester.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Acute pyelonephritis'</a>.)</p><p>AKI that is related to pregnancy may also occur in the postpartum period. This may be due to causes listed above that were present prior to delivery that have not resolved (eg, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, atypical HUS). AKI secondary to ATN may develop due to hemodynamic stress associated with either hemorrhage or sepsis.</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used routinely for postpartum analgesia. We have seen AKI associated with NSAID use after delivery, particularly when there are additional risk factors such as volume depletion or preeclampsia.</p><p>Individual etiologies are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preeclampsia with or without HELLP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preeclampsia is the most common cause of AKI during pregnancy. Preeclampsia refers to the new onset of hypertension and either proteinuria or other signs of systemic disease (including thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, AKI, pulmonary edema, cerebral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visual disturbances), usually after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 1</a>). The clinical features are extensively discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preeclampsia complicates 3 to 5 percent of all pregnancies; the risk is increased among women with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) from any cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most women with preeclampsia, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases on average by only 30 to 40 percent, which results in only minor increases in the serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is uncommon except in patients with very severe preeclampsia (eg, characterized by severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, pulmonary edema, cerebral and visual symptoms) and when there is accompanying hemorrhage and ischemic ATN.</p><p>Preeclampsia may occur with or without features of the HELLP syndrome. The HELLP syndrome refers to a variant in which hemolysis, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;, section on 'Laboratory criteria'</a>.)</p><p>AKI is more common when preeclampsia is accompanied by features of the HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some studies suggest that AKI occurs in 3 to 15 percent of cases of preeclampsia associated with the HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. AKI is often multifactorial in such cases since, in addition to the renal changes characteristic of preeclampsia such as endothelial cell swelling and injury, there is associated coagulopathy, which may result in bleeding, placental abruption, and ATN.</p><p>By contrast, based on clinical observation, AKI is much less common in patients with severe preeclampsia without features of HELLP syndrome, although there are few published studies that have examined incidence.</p><p>In some cases, preeclampsia is first diagnosed in the postpartum period, without documentation of antepartum hypertension and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Preeclampsia that is first observed in the postpartum period is particularly difficult to distinguish from microangiopathic disorders such as TTP or HUS. This issue is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8556749\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Severe preeclampsia is an indication for urgent delivery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>). The renal and extrarenal abnormalities typically begin to resolve spontaneously within two to three days postpartum, and complete recovery of GFR occurs within eight weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Moderately increased albuminuria (ie, between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min],</span> formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) may persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Women who develop preeclampsia may be at increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) later in life, but the absolute risk is small. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis#H21332987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'End-stage renal disease'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of the HELLP variant of preeclampsia is discussed elsewhere.

Pregnancy has been shown to induce the onset or relapse of ADAMTS13 deficiency-related TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Pregnancy is a well-recognized trigger for episodes of HUS in patients with these mutations. A study from France reported 21 patients with pregnancy-associated HUS (defined by the presence of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and AKI). Multiple different mutations of genes encoding complement-regulating proteins were identified in 18 of 21 patients (86 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Serum C3 levels were low at the time of the first complement assessment in 12 of 21 patients (57 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TTP and HUS differ in the timing of onset. TTP associated with ADAMTS13 deficiency occurs predominantly in the second and third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. ADAMTS13 levels tend to fall during the last two trimesters of pregnancy, which could contribute to the time course of development of TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Pregnancy-associated HUS more commonly occurs in the postpartum period; in a report from France, of 21 patients with pregnancy-associated HUS, 15 occurred after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>AKI may occur in either pregnancy-associated TTP or HUS, though it is more common among patients with HUS. In the French series of 21 patients, 17 (81 percent) required hemodialysis at least transiently, and 16 (76 percent) had ESRD at last follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Postpartum HUS may follow a normal pregnancy or be preceded by findings indistinguishable from preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/11,12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,27</a>].</p><p>TTP or HUS that initially occurs in nonpregnant women may relapse during a subsequent pregnancy, and recurrent TTP or HUS may develop during successive pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/20,23,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23,28,29</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is generally made by clinical features. Renal biopsy is usually not performed, at least initially, due to the increased risk for bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia.</p><p>However, if the thrombocytopenia and hemolysis resolve but AKI persists, a kidney biopsy may help to define the etiology and prognosis for recovery of renal function. A diagnostic approach to pregnant women with AKI is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8556749\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of pregnancy-associated TTP or HUS is discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy#H4109282067\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Management decisions'</a>). Plasma exchange is an important component of treatment of AKI due to either pregnancy-associated TTP or HUS. In cases of pregnancy-associated HUS, if AKI fails to improve after three to five treatments with plasma exchanges, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>, a monoclonal, humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG) that inhibits complement activation, may be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since HUS usually presents in the postpartum period, issues related to fetal toxicity due to eculizumab are not a concern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of AKI is supportive (see <a href=\"#H189808633\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below). In addition to plasma exchange and supportive care, delivery may be indicated if the patient is still pregnant, especially if the diagnosis is not certain. This is because the main differential diagnosis is usually preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome, which will improve after delivery.</p><p>Most patients requiring dialysis, however, are postpartum, and considerations for RRT are similar to nonpregnant adults with AKI (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;</a>).

Renal cortical necrosis is now generally considered quite rare in developed countries, however, and is responsible for only 1 to 2 percent of all cases of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
