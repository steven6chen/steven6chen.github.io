Irritant-induced respiratory problems were initially described among industrial workers and World War I combatants in the early part of the 20th century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These reports focused on acute effects such as pulmonary edema and death, but also described chronic respiratory sequelae of intense, brief exposure to inhaled irritants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, bronchitic symptoms, such as cough and wheezing, were described following a chlorine spill in 1969, although bronchial responsiveness was not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Persistent airway hyperresponsiveness was noted in five of seven subjects four years after an acute exposure to sulfur dioxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Further studies have led to a growing awareness and understanding of RADS and IIA, especially in firefighters, rescue personnel, and people living in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site in September 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and management of RADS and IIA will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of asthma and the causes, evaluation, and management of occupational asthma are discussed separately.

RADS can occur after exposure to a variety of chemicals generated as gas or aerosol, or exposure to high levels of particulates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55545 \">table 2</a>). Clinical and functional criteria for the diagnosis of RADS are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77064 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Irritant-induced asthma (IIA) is a more general term to describe an asthmatic syndrome that results from a single or multiple high dose exposure to irritant products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When only a single, high-dose exposure has been responsible, the term RADS or &quot;acute onset IIA&quot; is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. IIA caused by multiple exposures to high doses of irritants which induce acute symptoms requiring acute medical care has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The term &quot;sub-acute IIA&quot; has been proposed to describe instances of multiple high exposures to irritants where the onset of symptoms may be more insidious, as seen following the World Trade Center catastrophe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], or less well-documented exposures in which the affected individuals are able to identify the timing, nature, and frequency of events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. When IIA is caused by workplace exposures, it is considered a type of occupational asthma, the non-immunologic type.</p><p>Based on the level of available evidence of a causal relationship between workplace exposure to irritants and the inception of asthma on an individual basis, it has been proposed that acute onset IIA (or RADS) be called &quot;definite&quot; IIA, sub-acute IIA be called &quot;probable&quot; IIA, and other types of moderate or low dose exposure associated IIA be called &quot;possible&quot; IIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>IIA may also include a condition resulting from multiple exposures to low concentrations of an irritant that have led to bronchial mucosal injury and persistent asthma-like symptoms, although this is less well-established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The term &quot;low-dose RADS&quot; has been used to describe individuals in the latter group, although the background of repeated low-dose (as opposed to a single high-dose) exposure means that they do not formally fulfill the original criteria for RADS. In addition, when the intensity of the exposure is less, but is of greater duration (eg, &gt;24 hours), symptoms may start after several hours or days, rather than within minutes of inhalation, thus further &quot;widening the spectrum of irritant-induced asthma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The term Low Intensity Chronic Exposure Dysfunction Syndrome (LICEDS) has also been suggested to describe this form of IIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) may occur after inhalational accidents at home, in the workplace, or in the general environment. Irritant-induced asthma (IIA) due to multiple exposures is most commonly associated with inhaled irritants in the workplace. It is estimated that 60,000 inhalational accidents occur in the home and lead to medical consultation yearly in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Industrial accidents also have the potential to expose nonemployees to noxious inhalants; the release of isocyanates at Bhopal, for example, led to more than 2000 deaths due to pulmonary edema, and caused RADS in many others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Estimating the incidence of RADS is difficult for several reasons. Precise, subject-specific information regarding the duration and magnitude of exposure at the time of an accident is rarely available. This is further complicated in IIA, where multiple exposures to irritant products are involved; the level of exposure to the inhaled irritant can vary between exposures and between exposed subjects; and several irritant agents can also be involved simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The size of populations at risk after an incident can only be determined approximately in many cases.</p><p>The following observations, in which large numbers of patients were exposed to a chemical irritant, illustrate the variation in reported rates of development of RADS and IIA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After an accidental exposure to high concentrations of glacial acetic acid, the incidence of RADS among 51 hospital employees who were present during the 2.5 hours immediately following the accident was 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 289 workers exposed to chlorine gas in a pulp and paper mill, 71 (25 percent) developed respiratory symptoms shortly after the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among 239 workers with repeated exposures to chlorine and other gases over a three-year period, significant respiratory symptoms were reported by 38 (16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. No association between exposure level and persistence of symptoms was documented. Subsequently, a longitudinal follow-up of the same workers over a three-year period showed: (1) an effect on airway function related to the estimated number of symptomatic exposures and incidents, mostly among smokers; (2) a detectable increase in airway responsiveness associated with gassing incidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Professional cleaning is considered a high risk occupation for work-related asthma based on studies conducted in Europe and in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Among 123 cases of work-related IIA reported in a sentinel notification program in four states in the United States, cleaning agents were the most common reported implicated agent (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Cleaning agents may also cause occupational asthma by a mechanism of sensitization. More frequent atopy and higher levels of total IgE are found in these workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a group of 44 workers with symptoms on exposure to cleaning agents, 17 (39 percent) were found to have immunological occupational asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The main risk factor for developing respiratory diseases identified among the World Trade Center (WTC) rescue workers was the presence on the site of the WTC during the first 48 hours and the duration of exposure during rescue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atopy</strong> &ndash; While atopy has been described as a risk factor for the occurrence of the not-so-sudden-onset variant of IIA that develops days after an irritant exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], there is no evidence that atopy is a risk factor for the development of RADS or other forms of IIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/21,22,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,39</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway hyperresponsiveness</strong> &ndash; Previously documented airway hyperresponsiveness did not predispose to the development of RADS in firefighters at the World Trade Center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is likely that the pre-existing airway hyperresponsiveness was infrequent among these firefighters given that asthma is an exclusion criterion for recruitment. However, lifetime prevalence of asthma was increased in WTC responders by comparison with a large control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking</strong> &ndash; Smoking is more common among workers with RADS than in those with other types of occupational asthma and seems to increase the risk of functional decline in workers repeatedly exposed to puffs of chlorine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/23,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,31</a>].

The initial change was rapid denudation of the mucosa with a fibrinohemorrhagic exudate in the submucosa. This was followed by subepithelial edema and signs of regeneration of the epithelial layer with proliferation of basal and parabasal cells. Desquamation, subepithelial fibrosis, thickening of the reticular basement membrane, and regeneration of basal cells are all more striking in RADS than in occupational asthma with a latency period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80475 \">table 4</a>). In addition, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) reveals neutrophilia in the acute stage of RADS, whereas lymphocytes and eosinophils are more numerous in occupational asthma with a latency period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-asthma-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational asthma: Pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>The acute changes of RADS have been reproduced by exposing rats to high concentrations of gaseous chlorine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Histologic evaluation revealed epithelial flattening, necrosis, and evidence of epithelial regeneration. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increased number of neutrophils. Abnormalities in epithelial pathology and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were most prominent one to three days following injury. Epithelial abnormalities persisted in some animals for up to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In a mouse model of chlorine exposure, neutrophil-related airway hyperresponsiveness was dependent on an increase in oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a separate study, an antioxidant preparation diminished many features of tissue damage following exposure to chlorine gas, including the increase in BAL neutrophils and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The long term (approximately 10 years) pathological abnormalities of RADS have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Bronchial biopsies obtained from 10 subjects with irritant-induced asthma (IIA) at a mean of 10 years following an industrial accident showed neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reactive-airways-dysfunction-syndrome-and-irritant-induced-asthma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

When symptoms promptly follow a single high-dose exposure, the syndrome is called reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute symptoms associated with RADS include a rapid onset of a burning sensation in the throat and nose, chest pain, dyspnea, cough and wheeze. In IIA, the symptoms are similar, but the onset is less acute than with RADS. Questions that are helpful in the evaluation of RADS and IIA are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68098 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of RADS requires the combination of exposure to a high-dose of an inhalational irritant, onset of symptoms within hours (rarely days), and evidence of reversible airflow limitation (eg, spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility or positive non-specific bronchoprovocation challenge), although a restrictive defect can also be present. A chest radiograph is often obtained to exclude other causes of dyspnea. Criteria for the diagnosis of RADS are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77064 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4797885\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of IIA is based upon a history of single or multiple exposures to an irritating inhalational agent, the presence of asthma-like symptoms, and the presence of reversible airway obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperresponsiveness. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4797893\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with the acute onset of RADS, we recommend using the same treatment protocol that is used for an acute asthma exacerbation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>) including oral glucocorticoids and high dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without concomitant long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist. In our experience high dose inhaled glucocorticoids are often needed to control symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78011 \">table 8</a>). Inhaled rather than oral glucocorticoids are appropriate initial therapy for patients who present with less severe symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment in emergency department or urgent care setting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent symptoms due to RADS or IIA, we suggest following the step-wise approach used in asthma management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, patients are advised to avoid respiratory irritants, including cigarette smoke, and allergens to which they are sensitive. (See <a href=\"#H92154406\" class=\"local\">'Management of chronic RADS or IIA'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, workers with RADS or IIA are able to return to their working environment with appropriate asthma treatment and safety measures to prevent further high dose exposures. The worker should have ongoing monitoring to detect any deterioration in respiratory status. (See <a href=\"#H4798774\" class=\"local\">'Exposure avoidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with RADS and IIA improve over time, although many continue to have some respiratory symptoms for at least a year and have physiologic abnormalities such as non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness for several years.
