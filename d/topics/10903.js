In the largest study (6027 patients with IBD), the overall fracture rate was higher than that for controls (relative risk [RR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The increased risk occurred primarily in older (&gt;60 years) patients. There was no difference between UC and CD. In another study, risk of fracture increased with duration of corticosteroid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The findings described above are based upon fracture data collected from medical records or patient questionnaire and therefore represent primarily symptomatic fractures. Asymptomatic vertebral fractures may be more common than symptomatic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. As an example, in a study of 224 patients with CD, 20 percent of patients had vertebral compression fractures identified on vertebral radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Vertebral fractures occur on average at a younger age than in individuals without metabolic bone disease. Although low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk for fracture, many individuals have normal BMD at the time of fracture diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IBD are at risk for osteoporosis and fracture for several reasons, including disease-related inflammatory activity, corticosteroid therapy, hypogonadism, and nutritional deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22</a>]. Advanced age and low body mass index (BMI) further increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease-related inflammatory activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with IBD have low bone mineral density (BMD) in the absence of other identifiable risk factors. This can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have a low BMD at the time of diagnosis, before any treatment is given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis is common in patients with IBD who have received little corticosteroid and who are vitamin D replete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>The cause of low BMD in these untreated patients is not understood. In some cases, bone resorption is increased without a compensatory increase in bone formation. One possibility is that the chronic inflammatory state leads to increased intestinal production of cytokines (eg, interleukins 1 and 6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) that stimulate bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1,4,22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,22,25</a>]. In support of this hypothesis is the finding that maintenance treatment with the anti-TNF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, was associated with improvement in BMD in patients with CD, implicating a role for TNF-alpha in bone loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Changes in the RANKL (Receptor Activator of NF-Kappa B <span class=\"nowrap\">Ligand)/OPG</span> (osteoprotegerin) system may also contribute to low bone mass in patients with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. RANKL is expressed by cells of the osteoblast lineage. It interacts with a receptor on osteoclast precursors called RANK. The <span class=\"nowrap\">RANKL/RANK</span> interaction results in activation of cells in the osteoclast lineage to begin the process of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. However, RANKL can also bind to a soluble decoy receptor called osteoprotegerin (OPG). OPG blocks the interaction of RANKL and RANK, thereby preventing osteoclast activation and bone resorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption#H593827\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;, section on 'Osteoclasts'</a>.)</p><p>In one study of patients with IBD, plasma OPG and RANKL were elevated and correlated with BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Further studies are required to assess the role of the <span class=\"nowrap\">RANKL/RANK/OPG</span> system in bone loss in patients with IBD. If RANKL is shown to play an important role, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody to RANKL, may prove to be an effective therapy for osteoporosis in IBD.

Glucocorticoids cause bone loss by inhibiting bone formation, increasing bone resorption, decreasing intestinal absorption of calcium, and increasing renal excretion of calcium.

In one report, for example, the incidence of osteopenia was approximately twice as high (52 versus 28 percent) in patients who had been treated with corticosteroids compared with those who had not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In general, BMD in patients with IBD is inversely correlated with lifetime corticosteroids dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,5,9,10,12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,9,10,12,28</a>]. However, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse skeletal effects of corticosteroids from those of disease-related inflammatory activity because the two factors are often linked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations in sex hormone status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypogonadism is common in both men and women with IBD, probably because of the inhibitory effects of the illness and corticosteroid therapy on pituitary-gonadal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In men, corticosteroid therapy lowers serum testosterone concentrations by approximately one-third, primarily by inhibiting gonadotropin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Gonadal steroid deficiency is a well-recognized cause of osteoporosis in both men and women.

In one study, 65 percent of patients with CD had low serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This problem is in part due to malabsorption, particularly in patients with CD who have a history of small bowel resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70661\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70661 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Avoidance of dairy products may also contribute to vitamin D insufficiency. One study, for example, found that dietary calcium intake below 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> was more common in patients with CD than in normal subjects (53 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>However, BMD is reduced even in many patients who are vitamin D replete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolic-bone-disease-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is not the main cause of osteoporosis in most patients with IBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other nutritional deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macronutrient (protein, overall calories) and micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) deficiencies are common in patients with IBD and may contribute to bone disease.

Many studies have demonstrated that low bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with an increased risk of fracture. However, there are several clinical risk factors for fracture that are independent of BMD, such as advancing age, prior history of fragility fracture, chronic corticosteroid use, low body mass index (BMI), parental history of hip fracture, cigarette smoking, and excess alcohol. Thus, fracture risk assessment should include evaluation of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical risk factors for osteoporosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)</p><p/><p>We typically perform a history and physical examination to elicit clinical risk factors for fracture and lifestyle factors that contribute to bone loss, including smoking, excessive alcohol, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>We obtain a BMD study (DXA spine and hip) in patients with IBD who are at higher risk for osteoporosis and fracture (previous fragility fracture, postmenopausal, male &gt;50 years, hypogonadism, or chronic [&gt;3 months] glucocorticoid therapy).

However, in premenopausal women, men &lt;50 years of age, and children, the relationship between BMD and fracture risk is not well established. In these groups, Z-scores, not T-scores, should be used to interpret DXA scans. In addition, a diagnosis of osteoporosis in younger men, premenopausal women, and children should not be based upon DXA results alone.
