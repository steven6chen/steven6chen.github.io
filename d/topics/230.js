All children with appendicitis warrant fluid resuscitation as determined by their degree of dehydration, intravenous antibiotics targeting gut flora, and analgesia. Once stabilized as needed, patients with early or advanced appendicitis warrant urgent appendectomy as do ill-appearing patients with an appendiceal mass or abscess. Well-appearing patients with an appendiceal mass or phlegmon may initially be managed nonoperatively or undergo appendectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Early appendicitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Advanced appendicitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Appendiceal mass or abscess'</a> below.)</p><p>The status of the appendix (intact, perforated, localized mass [phlegmon], or abscess) is determined by clinical findings as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with early appendicitis typically have a recent onset (one to two days) of abdominal pain that over time has migrated from the periumbilical region to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) followed by low-grade fever, vomiting, and anorexia and associated with RLQ tenderness on physical examination. White blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein are typically elevated. In addition, some patients with early appendicitis may have equivocal findings of appendicitis by history and physical examination but have diagnostic imaging that confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6656915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical suspicion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging#H4189074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Diagnostic imaging&quot;, section on 'Imaging approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of clinical findings of appendicitis as described above for early appendicitis with additional findings of peritonitis (eg, fever, rebound, guarding, or rigid abdomen) and evidence of perforation on diagnostic imaging (eg, ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) can frequently establish the presence of advanced appendicitis prior to surgical removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in some patients, perforation is only discovered intraoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with an appendiceal mass (phlegmon) or abscess have a delayed presentation (at least five to seven days), and evidence of a periappendiceal mass or abscess on physical examination and diagnostic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY APPENDICITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early appendicitis is defined as appendicitis without evidence of perforation or gangrene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H166760781\"><span class=\"h2\">Appendectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that patients with early appendicitis have the appendix removed. Timely removal of an inflamed appendix prevents progression to rupture with peritonitis in some children and is curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Timely appendectomy has been the standard approach since the 1890s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Appendectomy also permits direct pathologic examination of the appendix and diagnosis of rare but important coexisting conditions such as a carcinoid tumor or alternative diagnoses such as terminal ileitis or ovarian torsion that change subsequent management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>It is a safe procedure with children experiencing less morbidity than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Wound infection and paralytic ileus are the primary early complications of appendectomy and occur in up to 9 percent and 2 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since the advent of antibiotics for preoperative treatment and an emphasis on early removal, mortality following appendectomy is very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The major life-threatening complication consists of late small bowel obstruction due to adhesions and occurs in &lt;1 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>However, preliminary evidence suggests that nonoperative management in selected patients can be successful.

The use of piperacillin and tazobactam for such patients is based upon the frequent difficulty in identifying whether the appendix is perforated in children prior to operation. However, in an observational study of almost 18,000 children with uncomplicated appendicitis of whom one-third received extended spectrum antibiotics (primarily piperacillin and tazobactam), treatment failure, defined as readmission within 30 days related to a complication of appendicitis, occurred in approximately 1 percent of all patients and was <strong>not</strong> reduced in the patients receiving extended spectrum antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.32; 95% CI 0.9-2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Patients with simple appendicitis do not require further doses of antibiotics. By contrast, antibiotics should be continued postoperatively in children with perforated appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p>The effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with early appendicitis is supported by a meta-analysis of 45 trials that noted a significant reduction in wound infections (5 versus 11 percent, odds ratio [OR] 0.37) and intraabdominal abscesses (0.6 versus 1.4 percent, OR 0.46) among adults and children undergoing appendectomy who received antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Whether any additional doses of antibiotics are beneficial in these patients was not addressed by this meta-analysis. However, a systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association concluded that evidence is lacking to support postoperative antibiotics in children with nonperforated appendicitis and most experts agree that additional doses of antibiotics in these patients are unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p><strong>Fluid therapy and analgesia</strong> &ndash; Intravenous hydration and analgesia should be provided. Any identified electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before surgery. Rehydration can be accomplished by giving 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> boluses of isotonic crystalloid until the signs of dehydration have resolved and the patient has voided. Once euvolemia has been established the child should receive half normal saline with 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a> at 1 to 1.5 maintenance and additional fluid losses (eg, vomiting) should be replaced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain control is also an important component of preoperative care of children with acute appendicitis, both before and after the diagnosis is made. Pain management should be guided by the patient's self-assessment of pain severity whenever possible. Intravenous opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a>) are typically the best choice. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Ketorolac</a> is an excellent choice for postoperative pain medication, and does not significantly increase the patient's bleeding risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Assessment of pain severity and cognition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568638\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of operation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, appendicitis has been considered a surgical emergency that requires prompt appendectomy to avoid perforation and other complications. However, evidence suggests that adverse outcomes (eg, perforation, complications, or operating time) are <strong>not</strong> increased for children who receive timely administration of antibiotics and undergo appendectomy less than 24 hours after diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of observational data and subsequent meta-analysis of 2510 patients with acute appendicitis (539 children younger than 16 years of age) found no increase in the frequency of complex appendicitis in patients who had a delay of 12 to 24 hours after admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, an increased risk of surgical site infection and 30 day complications occurred in patients for whom appendectomy was delayed beyond 48 hours after admission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter, prospective observational study of 955 children 3 to 18 years of age with appendicitis, duration of time &le;24 hours between emergency department evaluation and operation was <strong>not</strong> associated with a significant increase in appendiceal perforation on adjusted analysis, including children without perforation on computed tomography of the abdomen during initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A retrospective observational study of over 2400 children undergoing appendectomy at 23 children&rsquo;s hospitals also found no association between time to appendectomy &le;24 hours and complicated appendicitis or postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Of note, limiting the total time of <strong>symptoms</strong> prior to appendectomy rather than the time from diagnosis to surgery appears to be of greatest importance in preventing adverse outcomes. As an example, in a prospective, observational study, not included in the above systematic review, that evaluated 230 children who underwent appendectomy, patients with symptoms greater than 48 hours had a significantly higher rate of perforation when compared to patients with symptoms &le;48 hours (46 versus 12 to 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. When evaluated according to time from diagnosis, the perforation rate, length of stay, and operating time were not significantly different.</p><p>Furthermore, nonoperative management with antibiotics alone is feasible in selected patients with early, uncomplicated appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H166760703\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic or open approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that children with early appendicitis undergo appendectomy with a laparoscopic approach rather than an open approach.</p><p>Evidence supporting this recommendation for laparoscopic appendectomy includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two meta-analyses that compared laparoscopic to open surgery for acute appendicitis in children noted that laparoscopic procedures were associated with a significantly decreased hospital length of stay (mean difference 0.5 to 0.6 days) and risk of wound infection (1 to 2 versus 5 to 6 percent, odds ratio [OR] 0.20 to 0.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The mean difference in operative time was 7 to 11 minutes longer for laparoscopy which is of marginal clinical significance. Intraabdominal abscess was more common after laparoscopy in one meta-analysis that included observational studies and randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] but was of low frequency and could not be analyzed in the other meta-analysis of seven trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Good evidence to support decreased postoperative pain and earlier return to normal activities after laparoscopic appendectomy in children is lacking. However, the decrease in hospital length of stay provides indirect evidence for these benefits of the laparoscopic approach and is consistent with our experience.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review of almost 75,000 children undergoing appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis, laparoscopic appendectomy was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and no significant difference in postoperative complications such as wound infections or intraabdominal abscess when compare to open appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>Laparoscopic appendectomy may be performed using a three port (three incisions) or single incision technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

There is no proven benefit to inversion of the stump.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All purulent fluid should be aspirated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All incisions and trocar sites, other than 5 mm trocar sites, should be closed primarily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perforated appendix</strong> &ndash; In some patients thought to have early appendicitis based upon preoperative clinical findings, a perforated appendix will be encountered. Intraoperative considerations for patients with advanced (perforated) appendicitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative considerations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal appendix</strong> &ndash; When an apparently normal appendix is found, it should be removed. Removal of an appendix that appears grossly normal is generally recommended because microscopic inflammation may be noted on pathologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Removal of the appendix will also significantly diminish concern for the diagnosis of appendicitis if the patient develops another episode of abdominal pain, although stump appendicitis remains possible. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Late'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence for other possible causes of abdominal pain, including Meckel's diverticulitis, terminal ileitis, mesenteric adenitis, omental torsion, renal mass or obstruction, cholecystitis, or tubal or ovarian pathology should be sought if the appendix appears to be normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carcinoid tumor</strong> &ndash; Rarely, a carcinoid tumor will be seen or palpated in the appendix at the time of appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Simple appendectomy is sufficient treatment for most cases of appendiceal carcinoid. On the other hand, a right hemicolectomy is indicated if the tumor is greater than 2 cm in diameter, if the tumor invades through the wall of the appendix, or if the adjacent mesenteric nodes are involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-treatment-and-posttreatment-surveillance-of-nonmetastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-tract-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging, treatment, and posttreatment surveillance of nonmetastatic, well-differentiated gastrointestinal tract neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors&quot;, section on 'Appendix'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principle management issues after appendectomy in children with early appendicitis include adequate pain control and resumption of oral intake as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Analgesia</strong> &ndash; Postoperative pain is initially managed with parenteral opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> with repeated doses every four to six hours based upon additional pain assessment) supplemented by parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketorolac</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> with conversion to oral agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, acetaminophen, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a>) once the child is drinking well. To avoid side effects such as drowsiness and constipation some surgeons avoid all opioids for postoperative management of early appendicitis. Instead, they rely on wound blocks at the time of surgery and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications after surgery. Close attention to pain assessment and resolution of pain is essential, regardless of the regimen chosen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Assessment of pain severity and cognition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Little evidence provides a comparison of pain regimens for postoperative appendectomy care in children. In the past, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was discouraged because of the theoretical risk of bleeding. However, in studies of their use after other operations where hemorrhage is more likely to occur (eg, tonsillectomy), NSAIDs have <strong>not</strong> been associated with increased bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one observational study of 186 children undergoing appendectomy for early appendicitis using a single incisional laparoscopic technique, pain control with oral NSAIDs was adequate for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral intake and diet</strong> &ndash; Oral fluids can be introduced as soon as the child is awake. Diet may be advanced to solid food as tolerated. If admitted, most children are able to go home within 24 to 48 hours. Longer lengths of stay to permit continued treatment with antibiotics is necessary if the appendix was gangrenous or perforated.

However, some experts still prefer to perform early appendectomy in these patients. Current evidence is insufficient to determine which approach is better. For example, a small trial of 40 children with a well-defined abdominal abscess on computed tomography (CT) found no difference in total length of hospitalization, recurrent abscess rates, or overall charges between patients who received initial laparoscopic appendectomy or those treated with initial nonoperative therapy (percutaneous drainage, antibiotic administration) followed by interval appendectomy approximately 10 to 12 weeks later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, in a separate, retrospective study of over 200 children with advanced appendicitis of whom over two-thirds had an intraabdominal abscess at presentation, medical management was associated with significantly greater post-admission complications (eg, bowel obstruction and recurrent appendicitis), total length of hospitalization, and greater utilization of health care resources (eg, more imaging, longer duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, and more unscheduled repeat hospitalizations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>If nonoperative treatment (ie, intravenous antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage) is chosen, the surgeon must carefully monitor the patient&rsquo;s clinical progress.

If not, conversion to operative treatment may be warranted.</p><p>The ideal patient for initial nonoperative management is not ill appearing and has a well localized, tender mass in the right lower quadrant without signs of generalized peritonitis. The rationale for initial nonoperative treatment was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 61 observational and small randomized trials that included 55,593 adult and pediatric patients with acute appendicitis, 4 percent of whom had appendiceal abscess or phlegmon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thirty-six percent of 886 patients with abscess or phlegmon who underwent immediate surgery had morbidity, including postoperative infection, intestinal fistula, small bowel obstruction, and recurrence. This frequency of complications was significantly higher than for the 14 percent of 895 patients who initially were managed nonoperatively (odds ratio [OR] 3.4; 95% CI 2.0-5.6).</p><p>Nonoperative treatment includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous fluids should be administered.

Significant abscesses (&gt;3 to 4 cm in diameter) should be drained under image guidance (ultrasound or CT) by aspiration or placement of an indwelling catheter. Even multiple intraabdominal abscesses may be managed in this fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Smaller abscesses and those not amenable to percutaneous drainage can be treated with antibiotics, at least initially.</p><p>Percutaneous drainage or laparotomy may be indicated in patients initially selected for nonoperative management. Indications for intervention include lack of clinical improvement within 24 to 48 hours, continued fever, worsening of localized tenderness, or increased abdominal mass size.</p><p>Although continued nonoperative management is advocated by some experts, we suggest interval appendectomy 10 to 12 weeks following resolution of the initial episode, particularly for children with an appendicolith. An interval appendectomy is often performed 8 to 12 weeks following resolution of the initial episode of appendicitis in patients with appendiceal <span class=\"nowrap\">mass/phlegmon</span>.

Most recurrences developed within six months of hospital discharge. Of those patients not undergoing interval appendectomy, 20 percent required percutaneous abscess drainage.

The incidence of complications after interval appendectomy in 1247 children was 3.4 percent. Among the 955 children for whom histopathologic findings were reported, 0.9 percent had a carcinoid tumor.
