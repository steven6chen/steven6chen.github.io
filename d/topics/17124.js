Palpation is performed with the patient in the upright position.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior fontanelle is located at the juncture of the metopic, sagittal, and coronal sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81518 \">figure 2</a>). Generally, it is 3 to 6 cm (1.2 to 2.4 inches) in diameter through the first six months of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior fontanelle is located at the juncture of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81518 \">figure 2</a>). Usually, it is no larger than 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 inches) in diameter.</p><p/><p>Both fontanelles normally are soft and relatively flat. Visible or palpable pulsations of the anterior fontanelle are common, especially in the crying or agitated infant. Pounding pulsations or persistent tenseness of the fontanelle may indicate increased intracranial pressure. A depressed or sunken anterior fontanelle is compatible with dehydration or malnutrition.

Persistent craniotabes in children older than six to nine months may be an indication of several disorders, including syphilis and rickets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal time of fontanelle closure depends upon the patient's gestational age at birth. The posterior fontanelle usually cannot be palpated after two months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The anterior fontanelle generally closes between 10 and 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The fontanelles of premature infants tend to close at a later time. Growth of fibrous tissue over the fontanelle precedes closure by several months and may be difficult to distinguish from true closure on physical examination.</p><p>In a cross-sectional study, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of the head in young children (0 to 24 months of age) who were born at term were retrospectively reviewed for anterior fontanelle closure and surface area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The scans were performed for evaluation of clinical findings (eg, trauma, seizure, altered mental status); children with conditions associated with potentially altered anterior fontanelle geometry (eg, hydrocephalus, achondroplasia, craniosynostosis) were excluded.

It is thought to be due to incomplete ossification of the parietal bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a cross-sectional study of the sagittal suture, no infants older than 90 days had a palpable third fontanelle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In studies of consecutive newborn infants, 2 to 6 percent have a palpable third fontanelle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].

The diameter of the third fontanelle ranged from 7 to 35 mm (0.3 to 1.4 inches); approximately one-third of the third fontanelles were &ge;13 mm (0.5 inches). None of the infants in this study had associated major congenital malformations or congenital infections. However, given that a third fontanelle has been reported in children with Down syndrome, congenital infections (syphilis and rubella), and hip dislocation, some authors consider it to be a potential sign of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, auscultation of the skull for a bruit is helpful in detecting an arteriovenous malformation.

With both arms fully extended in opposite directions, the examiner begins wiggling a toy or the fingers of one hand and asks the patient to indicate (verbally or by pointing) when the movement comes into the child's visual field. Assuming the examiner has normal visual fields, assessment of any significant loss or deficiency in the patient can be determined. All four visual field quadrants should be tested.

Visualization is best achieved with the patient sitting in an upright position or lying supine with the head appropriately tilted. The examiner should insert the otoscopic speculum into the external auditory canal as gently as possible; the ulnar aspect of the hand holding the instrument is comfortably braced against the patient's face or forehead to steady the position of the instrument. At the same time, the thumb and index finger of the opposite hand are used to pull the pinna superiorly and posteriorly, allowing maximal visualization of the external auditory canal.</p><p>The caregiver can hold the child who is difficult to examine firmly on his or her lap, with the child's legs between his or her own legs. The child's head should be turned to the side and securely braced against the caregiver's shoulder or chest. Alternatively, the child may be placed in a supine position with extended arms and elbows firmly pinioned at the sides and extended legs gently immobilized by the weight of the accompanying adult's body lying over the thighs, knees, and lower legs. A papoose-like device can also be used to secure the child, if all else fails.</p><p>The smooth pink external auditory canal normally is short and straight in the infant and younger child, and somewhat longer and more angulated in the older patient. Tympanic membranes generally are translucent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52626\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52626 \">picture 26A</a>), occasionally allowing for visualization of several middle ear structures (umbo, manubrium of the malleus, round window niche, pars flaccida, and chorda tympani nerve) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75010 \">figure 6</a>). The normal tympanic membrane varies slightly in color and appearance; inexperienced examiners should not misinterpret what they are seeing.</p><p>A normal light reflex from the tympanic membrane provides little information regarding middle ear function. The degree of mobility of the tympanic membrane using pneumatic otoscopy or tympanometry is more helpful. Both techniques require a tight seal between the speculum or rubber ear piece and the external auditory canal.
