The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and nonsurgical management of posterior vaginal defects are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-nonsurgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and nonsurgical management of posterior vaginal defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The apical portion of the posterior vaginal wall consists of mucosa (which includes the epithelium of the posterior wall and the lamina propria), a superficial and deep muscularis layer, and adventitia. This fibromuscularis layer has been called &quot;rectovaginal fascia&quot; and &quot;perirectal fascia.&quot;</p><p>Histologic examination of the rectovaginal septum reveals that the distal portion near the perineal body contains dense connective tissue; the midportion has an adventitial layer containing fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, nerves, and elastic fibers; and the most proximal end is mostly adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The adipose tissue between the vaginal tube and rectum allows these two structures to function independently of one another.</p><p>Comparisons of the histology of women with and without prolapse have shown that the smooth muscle content of the posterior vaginal wall of women with prolapse is disorganized and significantly reduced compared to women without prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal anatomic support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upper fourth of the posterior vaginal wall is suspended by the cardinal-uterosacral ligament complex. The middle half is attached laterally to the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis proximally and the arcus tendineus rectovaginalis distally. The lower fourth fuses into the perineal body.</p><p>Anteriorly, the perineal membrane spans the anterior half of the pelvic outlet and is made up of a dense fibromuscular layer. The perineal body extends cranially in the posterior wall of the vagina to 2 to 3 cm proximal to the hymenal ring. Posteriorly, the perineal body includes the anterior portion of the external anal sphincter and its attachment to the longitudinal fibrous sheath of the internal anal sphincter. In addition, the perineal body is suspended by and attached to the puborectalis muscle.</p><p>The levator ani also provides an important support mechanism for the vagina. Posteriorly, the puborectalis acts as a sling that angles the mid-posterior wall approximately 45&ordm; from vertical, and closes the potential space of the vagina, as well as the levator hiatus. Proximally, the vagina lies upon, and is supported by, the pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus muscles. With a healthy pelvic floor, there is little stress and strain placed on the connective tissue support system. The levator hiatus is larger in women with prolapse than in women with normal support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a woman with an intact pelvic floor, the puborectalis is in a chronic state of contraction. This contraction closes the vaginal canal, such that the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are in direct apposition. With defecation, the increased pressure placed on the posterior vaginal wall is equilibrated by the opposing anterior vaginal wall, and there is minimal stress placed on the endopelvic fascial attachments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78927\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78927 \">figure 1</a>). If there is muscular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic damage to the puborectalis, the levator hiatus widens and the vaginal canal opens. The increased rectal pressure and distension associated with defecation places strain on the endopelvic fascial attachments and the fibromuscularis of the posterior vaginal wall, which can result in rectocele and its frequent companion, excessive perineal descent. One hypothesis for these findings is that the endopelvic fascia undergoes discrete tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is the rationale for the site-specific defect repairs described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgeon should examine the patient prior to the surgical admission to determine whether there is any evidence of an enterocele, sigmoidocele, or associated apical defects. This knowledge helps in planning the most effective surgical approach and preventing a potential repeat operation to address missed defects. If the patient has significant defecatory dysfunction or her symptoms do not correlate with findings on pelvic examination, then pelvic floor magnetic resonance imaging or defecation cystoproctography may reveal one or more of these other defects, or occult rectal prolapse or intussusception. If such defects are detected, the surgeon should counsel the patient about possible management options. Non-surgical management of these defects is beyond the scope of this review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-nonsurgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and nonsurgical management of posterior vaginal defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several trials have reported that bowel preparation prior to gynecologic surgery does not improve visualization, yet bowel preparation results in increased gastrointestinal symptoms and patient discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. For surgical repairs using a transvaginal approach, a bowel preparation only serves to contaminate the operative field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Therefore, for these cases, we suggest that the rectal vault be evacuated, as needed, during the preoperative examination under anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H8420779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Bowel preparation'</a>.)</p><p>In a small randomized study of women who underwent posterior vaginal wall repair with a transvaginal approach, an anal purse string suture was placed after sterile preparation and removed at the end of the procedure. Gross fecal contamination and positive <span class=\"nowrap\">perianal/perineal</span> cultures were significantly decreased in patients with an anal suture compared to those without an anal suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of rectocele repair is to relieve symptoms relevant to the anatomic support defect in the posterior vaginal wall.</p><p>Gynecologists typically perform a transvaginal repair with the patient in dorsal lithotomy position, while colorectal surgeons frequently operate through an endoanal approach with the patient in prone or jack-knife position.</p><p>There are two main methods of transvaginal rectocele repair: the traditional posterior colporrhaphy and the site-specific repair. Either of these methods may incorporate a biologic or synthetic graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Use in pelvic organ prolapse (POP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior colporrhaphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional rectocele repair has an anatomic cure rate of 76 to 96 percent. By plicating the posterior vaginal muscularis or medial aspect of the levator ani muscles in the midline, the posterior vaginal wall width is decreased, the fibromuscularis in the midline is increased, and the vaginal tube is narrowed. A perineorrhaphy is typically included in this repair.</p><p>Initial injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> below the vaginal mucosa aids with hydrodissection, as well as hemostasis. If the surgeon plans to perform a perineorrhaphy, a triangular-shaped incision is made into the perineal skin with the base of the triangle at the hymen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73011 \">figure 2</a>); if the introitus is already narrow, the surgeon may elect to make a vertical incision through the perineal skin and vaginal mucosa. The skin is dissected away from the perineal body. The vaginal epithelium is opened in the midline, extending the incision to an area superior to the defect, which may correspond to the vaginal apex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71429 \">figure 3</a>). The posterior vaginal epithelium is dissected bilaterally away from the underlying fibromuscularis layer until the levator muscles are reached on the lateral margins. It is important to remain in a plane close to the epithelium to avoid injury to the rectum, especially in the area close to the perineal body.</p><p>The posterior vaginal wall, stripped of its epithelium, is plicated in the midline with interrupted vertically or transversely placed sutures that incorporate a generous purchase of the fibromuscularis. Plication begins proximally and progresses toward the hymenal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50437 \">figure 4</a>). The surgeon should take care to ensure that each plication suture is in continuity with the previous one, or ridging of the posterior vaginal wall may occur and cause dyspareunia. A rectal exam should be performed in order to ensure that there are no areas of weakness that require further stitches and to check for any evidence of rectal injury or suture in the rectal mucosa.</p><p>The vaginal epithelium is trimmed only if necessary and closed with a running 2-0 absorbable suture. This step also narrows the caliber of the vagina, so the surgeon should not trim too much, especially in women with vaginal atrophy. The caliber of the vagina at the conclusion of the vaginal reconstruction should be at least three finger-breadths in sexually active women. To estimate adequate caliber, Allis clamps are placed on the posterior hymen and, when brought together in the midline, should allow for a three finger-breadth genital hiatus.</p><p>The rectocele repair can include a levator myorrhaphy, or a plication of the levator ani muscles. Interrupted sutures are placed laterally into the levator ani muscles, incorporating a portion of the lateral posterior fibromuscularis and tying down in the midline. This step provides a muscular posterior shelf, but may further constrict the vaginal caliber and be a source of postoperative pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspareunia (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below). However, it is an effective option for elderly women with a wide levator hiatus who do not expect to be sexually active.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Site-specific defect repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic cure rate of the site-specific posterior repair is 82 to 100 percent. The rationale for the site-specific repair is based on the theory that herniation of the rectum into the vagina results from specific tears in the rectovaginal fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These tears in the posterior vaginal wall may occur as an isolated defect in the lateral, distal, midline, or superior portions of the wall, or as a combination of defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52823%7EOBGYN%2F64155%7EOBGYN%2F71853%7EOBGYN%2F64583%7EOBGYN%2F78517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52823 graphicRef64155 graphicRef71853 graphicRef64583 graphicRef78517 \">figure 5A-E</a>).</p><p>The vaginal epithelium is opened at the perineal body in the manner previously described for the traditional posterior colporrhaphy. The posterior vaginal epithelium is incised in the midline to a level proximal to the rectocele bulge and dissected away from the underlying fibromuscularis. The dissection is extended laterally to the endopelvic fascial attachment of the posterior vaginal wall to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis and arcus tendineus fasciae rectovaginalis. The fibromuscularis is carefully inspected to identify breaks.</p><p>Irrigation and a rectal examination with the nondominant hand may accentuate the defects to aid identification. Defects are individually isolated and repaired with a delayed-absorbable 0 or 2-0 suture. If a distal defect is present (likely the result of a separation of the fibromuscularis from the perineal body), it should be repaired with absorbable suture in an attempt to reduce the incidence of postoperative dyspareunia.</p><p>Repair of perineal body defects are also addressed with interrupted sutures. Repeating the rectal examination should confirm repair of the rectocele. The vaginal epithelium is then closed with a running 2-0 absorbable suture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7705498\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft augmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of reconstructive materials (synthetic or biologic) to augment repair of posterior vaginal wall prolapse is not supported by the body of evidence, although some smaller trials have reported conflicting outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. In the largest trial to date comparing synthetic mesh, graft, and standard repair (ie, placebo) for women undergoing posterior repair, use of mesh or graft were not associated with improved outcomes for efficacy, quality of life, or overall adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, more than one in ten women who underwent a mesh repair had mesh-related complications. A different large cohort study reported that mesh-based posterior repair was associated with an increased risk of repeat prolapse surgery and later complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In observational studies of posterior vaginal prolapse repair, there have been poor results reported for a particular xenograft, a porcine dermal acellular collagen matrix (Pelvicol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Case series have reported high rectocele recurrence rates and poor wound healing. Well-designed studies are needed to further evaluate this graft.</p><p>Pre-cut mesh kit procedures have been developed by commercial companies for repair of posterior vaginal wall prolapse and other prolapse sites. However, these procedures have gained popularity without sufficient safety or outcome data supporting their use. Posterior repair with mesh kits has been evaluated by few studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One prospective study of anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior repair with the Prolift mesh kit (this product has been removed from the market) found that posterior repair alone with the Prolift mesh kit was associated with an 82 percent anatomic cure rate at one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Rates of mesh erosion or dyspareunia were not reported for posterior repair alone. </p><p>The technique of graft augmentation of rectocele repair is as follows. After completion of the rectocele repair and prior to the vaginal epithelium reapproximation, the graft is placed over the fibromuscularis plication in the case of a traditional repair, or over the corrected defects after the site-specific repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79333 \">figure 6</a>). Proximally, the graft can be attached to the apical support sutures if the patient is concurrently undergoing an apical suspension procedure. The graft material is attached bilaterally to the endopelvic attachment on the levator ani muscles in a proximal to distal fashion with absorbable or nonabsorbable 2-0 suture. There should be no tension on the graft. After trimming to the appropriate size, the distal portion of the graft is attached to the perineal body with interrupted, absorbable 0 sutures. The vaginal epithelium is closed and a perineorrhaphy is performed, if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Endorectal repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The colorectal surgeon typically operates on the distal rectocele from the endoanal or endorectal approach. The anatomic cure success rate for the transanal approach is 70 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An endorectal approach allows for simultaneous correction of other common anorectal pathology, such as hemorrhoids and mucosal rectal prolapse. As an example, one study reported that 53 percent of women undergoing a rectocele repair also had rectal mucosa prolapse and 41 percent had hemorrhoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, repair of proximal (high) rectoceles is difficult with the endorectal approach because of inadequate exposure.</p><p>This procedure is done in the prone jack-knife position with the buttocks spread and taped. An anal retractor is inserted to expose the anterior rectal wall. A U-shaped or T incision is made in the rectal mucosa at or proximal to the dentate line. A flap is developed to a level proximal to the rectocele (usually approximately 7 cm in length). The rectal mucosal flap is trimmed and the rectal mucosa is closed with a running 5-0 polyglycolic acid suture. If the mucosa is not removed, plication of the rectal mucosa can lead to necrosis and postoperative infection, and some patients also complain of persistent tenesmus. The rectovaginal septum is reapproximated using vertical plication sutures with a 3-0 polyglycolic acid suture. Levator ani plication also can be done with the endorectal approach.</p><p>There are several disadvantages to the transrectal or transanal repair. This approach does not allow the surgeon to perform a perineorrhaphy, anal sphincteroplasty, or a high rectocele repair unless a second incision is made. De novo fecal incontinence is also a concern after transanal repair, with rates that can range as high as 38 percent post-operatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another rare, but serious, complication is the development of a rectovaginal fistula.</p><p>The STARR (Stapling Transanal Rectocele Resection) procedure is under investigation for the treatment of outlet dysfunction constipation associated with rectocele. This procedure consists of introducing the circular stapler with a disposable circular anal dilator and a purse-string suture anoscope, stapling off a portion of the rectocele and internal rectal prolapse (including mucosa, submucosa and muscularis) first anteriorly, then posteriorly. A prospective multicenter trial reported the results of 90 patients with outlet obstruction who underwent this procedure, with significant improvement in constipation symptoms, no worsening of anal incontinence or dyspareunia, and restoration of rectal compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, complications included an 18 percent fecal urgency rate, and a 3 percent anastomotic stenosis rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Perineorrhaphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A perineorrhaphy, when indicated, completes the vaginal approach to a rectocele repair. Allis clamps are placed on the posterior hymen and brought together in the midline. Preservation of at least three finger-breaths at the genital hiatus is important for comfortable future coital activity. A triangular incision is made medial to the Allis clamps, extending to the midline of the perineal skin with the base of the triangle at the posterior hymen. The bulbocavernosus muscles are plicated in the midline of the perineal body with an interrupted 0 polyglactin suture. The surgeon should avoid creating a ridge from overly plicating the bulbocavernosus muscles. The transverse perinei muscles are plicated. An anal sphincteroplasty may be performed as indicated for anal incontinence and an <span class=\"nowrap\">external/internal</span> anal sphincter defect. The skin is closed with a running suture of 2-0 polyglactin. A perineorrhaphy can slightly increase the functional length of the posterior vaginal wall. However, aggressive perineorrhaphy may constrict the vaginal introitus and cause superficial dyspareunia or apareunia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Anal sphincteroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive dissection and repair are required for women with an absent perineal body. Preoperative work-up with endoanal ultrasound may reveal an anal sphincter defect. A difficult vaginal delivery or surgical trauma are the usual causes.</p><p>A transverse semi-circular incision is made in the layer separating the posterior vaginal wall and the anterior rectal wall. Dissection is extended laterally and proximally. To facilitate proximal dissection in the rectovaginal space without injury to the rectal mucosa, the surgeon may insert a finger of the non-dominant hand into the rectum. The internal anal sphincter is plicated in the midline with a 3-0 absorbable suture. The rectal mucosa is reapproximated, as needed, with a running absorbable 3-0 suture and extended to the skin overlying the external anal sphincter. Dissection of the anus is performed to identify the retracted ends of the external anal sphincter. Care should be taken with this step to avoid extensive lateral and posterior dissection and injury to the inferior hemorrhoidal nerves and vessels. The ends of the external anal sphincter are identified and reapproximated in an overlapping fashion with vertical mattress sutures of 0 delayed absorbable suture. The scar on the ends of the external anal sphincter are left intact and used for suture placement.</p><p>The transverse perinei and bulbospongiosus muscles are plicated in the midline. With midline construction of the perineal body, the transverse portion of the initial incision becomes vertically oriented. The vaginal epithelium is closed with 2-0 absorbable suture. The skin of the perineal body is closed in an inverted Y shape with interrupted absorbable 2-0 sutures. The patient is instructed that superficial wound breakdown on the perineum may occur. In most cases, this superficial wound breakdown will respond to conservative management, rather than require aggressive debridement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal sacral colpopexy (colpoperineopexy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior wall support defects are often secondary to loss of apical support and by correcting the apical support, the posterior wall is restored without a separate rectocele repair. The abdominal sacral colpopexy is a procedure that attaches mesh to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the vagina to suspend the apex of the vagina to the sacral promontory. An abdominal or laparoscopic approach may be performed when the rectocele is accompanied by apical prolapse. These procedures are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of apical prolapse (uterine or vaginal vault prolapse)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Iliococcygeus fascia suspension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This procedure is primarily used for apical suspension, but may be used to correct high lateral rectocele defects. The surgical procedure is described in detail separately.

Thus, postoperative management is based on the surgeon's clinical experience and varies significantly among surgeons. We place a vaginal pack at the end of the procedure. This pack and the Foley catheter are removed the next morning. We suggest that patients avoid lifting more than 10 pounds and take stool softeners to avoid straining for three months. We also ask them to maintain pelvic rest (avoid the use of tampons, douching, or sexual intercourse) for at least six weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain, temporary urinary retention, and constipation are common in the perioperative period. Serious complications are uncommon complications, and include development of a hematoma, infection, inclusion cyst formation, fecal impaction, and injury to the rectum with the development of a rectovaginal or a rectoperineal fistula. Bowel and defecatory dysfunction may continue long-term, and prolapse may recur (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below). De novo dyspareunia or fecal incontinence may also occur. Utilization of mesh is associated with additional complications, such as mesh erosion, infection of the graft, and persistence of granulation tissue.

As an example, a cohort study compared women who underwent posterior repair to those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The type of posterior repair (eg, traditional versus site-specific) was not specifically described. Preoperatively, there were no differences in dyspareunia rates between groups. Postoperatively, both groups reported overall improvement in sexual function (based on the pelvic organ prolapse urinary incontinence sexual questionnaire [PISQ]). However, there was significant increase in postoperative dyspareunia in women who had posterior repair versus those who did not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the repair of posterior vaginal prolapse may involve a vaginal, transanal, or laparoscopic approach. The choice of approach depends upon the surgeon and patient preference, surgeon's skill level (especially in the case of laparoscopic repair), type of defect, symptomatology, and whether there is a need for concomitant surgical procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal versus transanal approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior colporrhaphy, a vaginal approach to posterior prolapse repair, is more effective than a transanal approach. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of three randomized trials that found a significantly lower rate of objective failure for posterior colporrhaphy (10 versus 42 percent; risk ratio 0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.64) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/10,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30-32</a>]. The trials also demonstrated that the transvaginal repair led to better anatomic results (by mean Ap points on the follow-up POP-Q examination). The risk of de novo dyspareunia was similar in both groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior colporrhaphy versus site-specific versus graft augmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One prospective randomized trial of 106 patients compared three surgical techniques of rectocele repair: traditional colporrhaphy, site-specific repair, and site-specific rectocele repair augmented with a porcine-derived, acellular collagen matrix graft (Fortagen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This trial used condition-specific validated quality of life questionnaires at baseline and follow-up: the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory short form (PFDI-20), the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire short form 7 (PFIQ-7), and a sexual function questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ <span class=\"nowrap\">Prolapse/Urinary</span> Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire short form (PISQ-12). Major findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At one year after surgery, anatomic cure of prolapse (defined as &le;Stage II) was comparable in the posterior colporrhaphy group (86 percent) and the site-specific group (78 percent). The cure rates of both traditional and site-specific rectocele repair groups were statistically significantly better than the graft-augmented site-specific repair (54 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior wall prolapse to or beyond the hymen developed in 20 percent in those who received graft augmentation, compared to 7.1 percent in the posterior colporrhaphy group and 7.4 percent in the site-specific repair group. Time to development of posterior vaginal wall prolapse was significantly earlier in the graft augmentation group compared to the traditional rectocele repair group. The site-specific group also developed recurrent prolapse earlier than the traditional posterior colporrhaphy group, but this was not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional failure (worsening of prolapse or colorectal symptoms one year after surgery) occurred in 16 percent of the posterior colporrhaphy group, 12 percent of the site-specific repair group, and 21 percent of the graft augmentation group. These differences were not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defecatory dysfunction decreased significantly postoperatively, with no significant differences among treatment groups. At one-year follow-up, the development of new onset bowel dysfunction was uncommon (11 percent), with the cure of posterior vaginal prolapse at Stage 0 or 1 associated with the significant reduction in bothersome straining and incomplete emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who underwent perineorrhaphy (where the rectovaginal septum was reattached to the perineal body) were significantly less likely to report bothersome splinting one year after surgery after controlling for treatment group and baseline symptoms (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.004-0.71).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative dyspareunia rate was 51 percent, and the postoperative dyspareunia rate was 36 percent, with no significant differences among the groups (20 percent in the posterior repair group, 14 percent in the site-specific group, and 6 percent in the graft augmentation group). The high preoperative dyspareunia rate may be due to the use of a validated sexual function questionnaire. There was improvement in sexual function after rectocele repair, regardless of the technique used.</p><p/><p>In summary, anatomic and functional outcomes were not significantly different for the standard posterior colporrhaphy and site-specific repair groups, but were overall superior to the graft augmentation group. Bowel and sexual function and quality of life significantly improved in all three groups.</p><p>There may be a number of etiologies for the worse outcomes in the graft augmentation group. This particular graft may have impaired normal healing. Alternatively, the body may have perceived the graft as foreign material due to its cross-linking or if it was not completely acellular and still contained porcine DNA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Use in pelvic organ prolapse (POP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transvaginal repair of rectoceles encompasses a variety of approaches, eg, the traditional posterior colporrhaphy with transverse midline plication of the rectovaginal fascia, with or without levator ani plication, and the site-specific posterior repair, either of which can include graft augmentation. Ultimately, the goal of rectocele repair is to improve prolapse symptoms, bowel function, and sexual function. In general, anatomic cure rates are good, between 76 to 100 percent, with overall improvement in bowel symptoms, regardless of the type of repair. The definitions of success and failure vary from author to author; however, the advent of validated functional quality of life questionnaires and the adoption of Stage II prolapse (ie, leading edge of prolapse &ge;-1) as anatomic failure should improve standardization of the way outcome data are presented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Posterior colporrhaphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several prospective studies of traditional rectocele repair have been reported. The range of findings from some representative examples are provided below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series including 25 patients reported an anatomic cure rate of 96 percent after 12 months, with reduction in symptoms of constipation (falling from 100 percent preoperatively to 88 percent postoperatively), vaginal bulge (falling from 21 to 4 percent), and splinting (falling from 50 to 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, the de novo dyspareunia rate was 8 percent in the setting of the routine performance of a levator ani plication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study prospectively evaluated women with prolapse and incontinence and described a 25 percent dyspareunia rate in the 53 women who underwent posterior colporrhaphy, with an even higher rate of dyspareunia (38 percent) in those who had undergone a concomitant Burch procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Levator plication was not routinely performed with the posterior colporrhaphy and only one of the 15 women who developed dyspareunia had had a levator ani plication. Postoperative introital caliber was not significantly associated with dyspareunia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study performed a midline rectovaginal fascial plication in 38 women with symptomatic rectoceles who regularly needed to splint in order to defecate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The subjective success rate was 98 percent at 12 months and 89 percent at 24 months, with an objective success rate (Stage 0 or 1 prolapse) at 12 and 24 months of 87 and 79 percent, respectively. Obstructed defecation was relieved in 87 percent of patients, and all bowel function parameters showed significant improvement. The rate of dyspareunia decreased from 37 to 5 percent, which may be related to the authors' surgical technique which avoided levator ani plication and trimming of the vaginal epithelium. Overall patient satisfaction was 97 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study of 68 women undergoing prolapse and incontinence surgery reported significant improvement in obstructed defecation symptoms in those women who underwent posterior colporrhaphy compared with those who did not. Posterior repair improved POP-Q point Bp and the rectovaginal pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Site-specific repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several case series have reported de novo dyspareunia rates of 2 to 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. Bowel symptoms (constipation, splinting, fecal incontinence) also improved, with anatomic cure rates of 82 to 100 percent.</p><p>A review comparing 124 patients who underwent site-specific rectocele repair to 183 patients who had a standard posterior colporrhaphy reported that at one year, subjective and objective recurrence rates were significantly higher after the site-specific rectocele repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, postoperative dyspareunia, constipation, and fecal incontinence were not significantly different for the two groups. Thirty-three percent in each group reported improvement in dyspareunia, and 11 percent in each group had de novo dyspareunia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft augmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graft augmentation data consist mostly of case series. As with the other surgical approaches, bowel symptoms improve after surgery. A systematic review by the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons Systematic Review Group on the use of grafts in transvaginal pelvic organ prolapse repair concluded that there is insufficient evidence to guide decisions whether to use graft materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; associated clinical guidelines issued by the same group suggest that native repair remains preferable to graft use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Use in pelvic organ prolapse (POP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Discussion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic outcomes for traditional versus site-specific rectocele repair do not appear to be significantly different. Levator ani plication likely contributes to de novo dyspareunia and should not be performed in sexually active women. The use of adjunctive graft material still requires more study, but the evidence thus far does not support the use of porcine dermis (Pelvicol) or small intestine (Fortagen). Mesh erosion is a concern with the use of polypropylene. Nevertheless, given the variety of grafts available, there are insufficient data to either recommend or advise against the use of other graft materials at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectocele repair outcomes are generally good. Success rates for traditional colporrhaphy and site-specific repairs range from 76 to 96 percent and 56 to 100 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women undergoing repair of posterior vaginal wall prolapse, we recommend standard posterior colporrhaphy or site-specific repair over crosslinked porcine small intestine graft augmented repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Suture-only repair results in a greater reduction of recurrent posterior prolapse than porcine graft. Bowel and sexual function and quality of life significantly improve with any of the three procedures.

(See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Posterior colporrhaphy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apical suspension procedures, such as sacral colpopexy or iliococcygeus fascia suspension, may be required in addition to traditional colporrhaphy and site-specific repair to correct the rectocele.
