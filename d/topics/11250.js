Moderate hypertensive retinopathy was often referred to as &quot;accelerated hypertension,&quot; but this term should likewise be avoided. Patients with moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy frequently have acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (formerly called &quot;malignant nephrosclerosis&quot;), although kidney biopsies are seldom performed. <br/><br/>Historically, papilledema was the hallmark of a more advanced condition (ie, &quot;malignant hypertension&quot;) associated with a higher mortality (akin to having a malignancy). However, the advent of effective antihypertensive drug therapy has improved the prognosis and patients with moderate and severe hypertensive retinopathy have similar outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, acute treatment of such patients is the same whether or not papilledema is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypertensive encephalopathy</strong> &minus; Hypertensive encephalopathy refers to the presence of signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of cerebral edema caused by severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden rises in BP. It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of central nervous system dysfunction are ruled out, and it characteristically responds dramatically to acute lowering of the mean arterial pressure, sometimes by as little as 10 to 15 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies-in-adults#H60092188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic emergencies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF VASCULAR INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure (BP), the initial response is arterial and arteriolar vasoconstriction. This autoregulatory process both maintains tissue perfusion at a relatively constant level and prevents the increase in pressure from being transmitted to the smaller, more distal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>With increasingly severe hypertension, however, autoregulation eventually fails (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The ensuing rise in pressure in the arterioles and capillaries leads to acute damage to the vascular wall. Disruption of the vascular endothelium then allows plasma constituents (including fibrinoid material) to enter the vascular wall, thereby narrowing or obliterating the vascular lumen. Within the brain, the breakthrough vasodilation from failure of autoregulation leads to the development of cerebral edema and the clinical picture of hypertensive encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The level at which fibrinoid necrosis occurs depends upon the baseline BP. Patients with chronic hypertension have arteriolar hypertrophy that minimizes the transmission of pressure to the capillary circulation. Grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy are often associated with diastolic pressures above 120 mmHg. By comparison, hypertensive encephalopathy can be seen at diastolic pressures as low as 100 mmHg in previously normotensive patients with acute hypertension due to preeclampsia or acute glomerulonephritis; patients in whom autoregulation is impaired also may develop hypertensive injury at relatively mild degrees of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In addition to protecting tissues against the effects of severe hypertension, autoregulation also maintains tissue perfusion during the treatment of hypertension via arterial and arteriolar vasodilation. Since flow is equal to pressure divided by resistance, parallel reductions in both parameters allow sufficient blood flow to be maintained. However, an excessive hypotensive response <strong>below</strong> the autoregulatory range can lead to ischemic symptoms. The arteriolar hypertrophy induced by chronic hypertension means that hypoperfusion will occur at a higher BP than in normotensive subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that factors other than the level of BP, particularly activation of the renin-angiotensin system, may contribute to the development of fibrinoid necrosis. Plasma renin activity is often increased in patients with grades III and IV hypertensive retinopathy, potentially mediated by both an initial natriuresis induced by the high pressure and renal vascular injury. The importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the vascular injury of severe hypertension has been demonstrated in transgenic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, rats prone to severe hypertension were treated with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or no therapy. Ramipril significantly reduced the frequency of arteriolar fibrinoid necrosis, despite having no significant effect on BP, suggesting a role for the renin-angiotensin system independent of BP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy most often occur in patients with longstanding, uncontrolled hypertension, many of whom have discontinued antihypertensive drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Yet few non-ophthalmologists can distinguish moderate from severe retinopathy, and the value of fundoscopy in hypertensive patients is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Hypertensive encephalopathy, which is related to cerebral edema, is characterized by the <strong>insidious</strong> onset of headache, nausea, and vomiting, followed by nonlocalizing neurologic symptoms such as restlessness, confusion, and, if the hypertension is not treated, seizures and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, patients with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage typically present with abrupt and focal neurologic symptoms. However, such patients may occasionally have insidious and generalized neurologic symptoms and, because the treatment of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage differs significantly from the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy, diagnostic imaging is critical to distinguish the cause of neurologic symptoms.

It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion, after other causes of central nervous system dysfunction are ruled out, and it characteristically responds dramatically to acute lowering of the mean arterial pressure, sometimes by as little as 10 to 15 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy most often occur in patients with longstanding, uncontrolled hypertension, many of whom have recently discontinued antihypertensive drug therapy.

However, cerebral imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images, may reveal edema of the white matter of the parieto-occipital regions, a finding consistent with hypertensive encephalopathy that is termed &quot;reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome.&quot; When the MRI reveals primarily pontine abnormalities, the condition has been called &quot;hypertensive brainstem encephalopathy.&quot; Ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage should be excluded in patients with severe hypertension and neurologic symptoms since treatment of these conditions differs from the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy.
