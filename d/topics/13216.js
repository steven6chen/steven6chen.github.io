Psychotherapy can provide support for patients and families, and address disruption of developmental processes (eg, family, social, and academic functioning), comorbidities (eg, substance use disorders) and preexisting behavioral problems, medication adherence, and relapse prevention. A relatively simple form of psychotherapy is psychoeducation, which appears to be efficacious and is a core element of more elaborate and intensive psychotherapies (eg, family therapy).</p><p>This topic reviews the efficacy and core elements of different adjunctive psychotherapies for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. Choosing a specific psychotherapy is discussed separately in the context of an overview of choosing treatment for mania, comorbid disorders, and maintenance treatment. Other aspects of pediatric bipolar disorder are also discussed separately, including choosing treatment for bipolar major depression; the efficacy, administration, and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics for pediatric mania; the general principles of using pharmacotherapy; assessment and diagnosis; and the epidemiology, clinical features, and course of illness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-major-depression-choosing-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar major depression: Choosing treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-mania-and-second-generation-antipsychotics-efficacy-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric mania and second-generation antipsychotics: Efficacy, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-clinical-manifestations-and-course-of-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5071445\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all psychotherapies, patients must have the necessary motivation, interest, and cognitive capacity to participate in treatment and complete assigned tasks.

Dialectal behavior therapy included 36 sessions devoted to individual skills training (which target problematic behaviors such as nonadherence to medications) and family therapy (psychoeducation, tolerating distress, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness). In addition, patients monitor mood, sleep, suicidal ideation and behavior, and medication adherence on a daily basis, and can call therapists in between appointments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, depression was less severe in patients who received dialectal behavior therapy than the controls, and the estimated mean number of euthymic weeks was two times greater with active treatment.

Both treatment groups received 12 weekly sessions followed by 6 monthly maintenance sessions. Family therapy included psychoeducation, communication training, family problem-solving skills, developing routines, affect regulation, mindfulness techniques, and improving self-esteem. The control therapy was selected by the therapist and largely avoided the elements of family therapy. Reduction of manic and depressive symptoms, as well as improvement of psychosocial functioning, was greater with family therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial compared family therapy with psychoeducation in 58 adolescents with bipolar disorder who were treated with pharmacotherapy and followed for up to two years after study entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Family therapy consisted of 21 sessions focused upon psychoeducation, communication, and problem solving. Psychoeducation consisted of three weekly sessions administered to the patient and family. The mean time to recovery from depressive symptoms was faster with family therapy than psychoeducation (10 versus 14 weeks). Time to recovery from mania also favored family therapy (8 versus 14 weeks), but the difference was not statistically significant. Time to recurrence of a mood episode was comparable for the two treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third trial compared family therapy with an education control condition in 40 youth with acute symptoms of hypomania <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Diagnoses at study entry consisted of other specified bipolar and related disorder, cyclothymic disorder, or unipolar depression; patients with bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder were not enrolled. Nearly half of the patients were not taking medication at study entry. Family therapy consisted of 12 sessions focused upon psychoeducation, communication, and problem solving; the control consisted of one to two family sessions devoted to reviewing the patient&rsquo;s diagnosis, daily mood monitoring by the family, and managing symptoms. Both groups were followed for up to one year after study entry. The mean time to recovery from symptoms was faster in the family therapy group than the control group (13 versus 21 weeks), and total time in remission was greater with family therapy (27 versus 20 weeks). </p><p/><p>A common element of different family therapy models that have been developed is enhancing communication among family members. Therapists work with the family on active listening, which includes looking at the speaker, concentrating on what is said, and clarifying any uncertainties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>]. In addition, the family is encouraged to offer each other positive feedback and to criticize specific behaviors or request changes in behavior in a constructive and positive manner (eg, &ldquo;Would you please play the music more softly?&rdquo;). The family is also encouraged to reduce &ldquo;expressed emotion,&rdquo; which is defined as critical and hostile comments about the patient, as well as emotional overinvolvement with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Some of the work aimed at improving communication can involve role playing.</p><p>Problem solving is another aspect that is generally addressed in family therapy. Therapists work with the family to identify and define their problems, and for each problem, consider the barriers to its resolution, set an achievable goal, list and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages for all available solutions (brainstorming), choose one option, develop an action plan and implement it, and evaluate the outcome. </p><p>Family therapy can also help the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support the use of pharmacotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize conflict and volatility in the home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain reasonable expectations for each other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain routines (eg, meals together)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquire social services</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5072388\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An observational study of adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 12) who were treated with medications suggests that adjunctive interpersonal and social rhythm therapy may perhaps help improve symptoms and functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-efficacy-and-core-elements-of-adjunctive-psychotherapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Family psychotherapy consisted of 21 sessions, administered over nine months, focused upon psychoeducation, communication, and problem solving. Time to recovery from either depressive symptoms or <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms was comparable for adjunctive psychoeducation and family therapy.
