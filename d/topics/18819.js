Hemodialysis is frequently difficult to perform because of hemodynamic instability, and outcomes are dismal in patients who are not listed for liver transplant. In a retrospective cohort study, mortality at six months was 84 percent (median survival, 21 days) among patients not listed for transplant who developed hepatorenal syndrome and initiated dialysis; recovery of kidney function sufficient to stop dialysis occurred in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome, the most appropriate use of dialysis is as a bridge to liver transplantation.

Adolescents were screened before compulsory military service and those with normal renal function at that exam were included in the cohort, with follow-up data linked to the Israeli ESRD registry. Although risk was increased, the absolute incidence of ESRD in adults with a history of kidney disease in childhood was low (16 to 23 cases per 100,000 person-years), so it is unclear if a history of childhood renal disease alone warrants additional screening for chronic kidney disease in adulthood.

A recent study of 4481 patients with all types of cancer developed a score-based model to predict the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) after the first course of cisplatin, based upon the presence of four identified risk factors (age, cisplatin dose, history of hypertension, and hypoalbuminemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Higher scores correlated with an increased incidence of AKI; the probability of cisplatin-induced AKI was 10, 24, and 51 percent for scores of 3, 5.5, and 8.5, respectively. Additional studies will be required to determine the utility of this model in clinical practice.

The rapid and efficient removal of nephrotoxic serum free light chains combined with anti-myeloma therapy may improve renal outcomes. A randomized trial of 98 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, severe AKI requiring hemodialysis, and biopsy-confirmed light chain cast nephropathy compared the efficacy of hemodialysis with a high-cutoff dialyzer (with larger membrane pores and higher permeability to light chains) versus a conventional high-flux dialyzer; all patients received bortezomib-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There was no difference in renal recovery at 3 months, although more patients in the high-cutoff group were dialysis-independent at 6 and 12 months. The results of this trial support our suggestion to perform extracorporeal light chain removal, using either plasmapheresis or high-cutoff dialysis, in patients with light chain cast nephropathy and AKI. High-cutoff dialysis is not currently available in the United States.

The pathogenesis of the disease and its early clinical presentation are not known. Clinical and laboratory features of early disease were recently identified in an active surveillance study of agricultural workers who presented with acute or subacute kidney injury in a high-risk area of Nicaragua [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Criteria, including increased creatinine, leukocyturia and specific systemic signs and symptoms, were proposed for a case definition of acute MeN. Using selected defined criteria, a biopsy study of 11 patients found tubulointerstitial nephritis in all 11 biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the criteria used for inclusion in this small series have not been validated, and it is not known whether individuals in this study progressed to the more typical chronic stage of MeN, these studies suggest that acute MeN is acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, possibly caused by an infectious or toxic exposure.

A large multicenter randomized trial now shows that tolvaptan, compared with placebo, slowed the decline in kidney function at 12 months among ADPKD patients with reduced baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Adverse effects included increases in serum alanine transaminase levels, as have been previously observed.

Earlier studies have been inconsistent but indicated that the administration of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetylcysteine</a> may decrease the risk of AKI, and led to our previous suggestion to administer acetylcysteine before and the day of angiography to patients at risk of contrast nephropathy. A recent randomized trial in over 5000 patients at increased risk for nephropathy who were undergoing scheduled angiography found that oral acetylcysteine, compared with placebo, did not prevent death, need for dialysis, or decline in kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The trial was a 2 by 2 factorial design and also compared intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> with isotonic saline, finding no benefit for sodium bicarbonate. UpToDate recommends giving isotonic saline rather than sodium bicarbonate and now suggests not giving acetylcysteine prior to angiography.

Most of the patients had a prior history of quinine-induced fever, nausea, headache, or confusion. Many reported symptoms within four hours of quinine ingestion. All had acute kidney injury. Eighteen required dialysis, and two underwent renal transplantation. Eighteen had quinine-dependent antibodies.

The highest FGF23 quartile was associated with more rapid decline in the annualized eGFR compared with the lowest FGF23 quartile, even among individuals with preserved eGFR. Higher FGF23 levels were also associated with a greater increase in height-adjusted total kidney volume, which predicts progression of CKD, but adding FGF23 to existing prediction models did not improve the prediction of CKD progression. These data suggest a possible mechanistic role for FGF23 in progression of polycystic kidney disease.

Previously, only unblinded studies showed a benefit from this procedure. In a small blinded trial of 80 patients without resistant hypertension (24-hour systolic pressure 140 to 170 mmHg on no antihypertensive medications), renal denervation reduced ambulatory blood pressure by 5 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/4</span> mmHg diastolic compared with a sham procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-nephrology-and-hypertension/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In the intervention group, SBP was maintained within 10 percent of the patient&rsquo;s resting baseline value, with norepinephrine infusion as needed, while the control group received standard care (treatment to maintain the SBP &ge;80 mmHg or to prevent a 40 percent or greater decrease from baseline SBP). The primary composite outcome (systemic inflammatory response syndrome with renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic dysfunction) occurred less frequently in the intervention group. This study supports individualizing intraoperative management to maintain the blood pressure close to the patient&rsquo;s baseline in patients at high risk of postoperative complications due to chronic hypertension, age, or other factors.

Its use in other patients with MM is less attractive given its markedly higher cost and lack of an efficacy advantage over intravenous zoledronic acid in two randomized trials. Importantly, if denosumab is discontinued, at least one dose of intravenous bisphosphonates must be given to prevent rebound osteoclast activity which can lead to rapid bone loss and increased risk of fractures. Denosumab was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with MM.
