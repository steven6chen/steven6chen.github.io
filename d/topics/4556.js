These metabolic changes may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis and to the higher incidence of ischemic heart disease characteristic of patients with diabetes mellitus.

The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome may be increased in patients with RA. This was illustrated in a study of 88 patients with early RA, 66 with longstanding RA, and 85 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The metabolic syndrome was present in 31 percent of patients with early RA, in 42 percent of those with longstanding RA, and in 11 percent of controls.

One study suggests that, with the exception of former cigarette smoking, these risk factors are not more prevalent in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than in women without RA. This was best shown in an analysis of the Nurses' Health Study in which the clinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease were compared in women with and without RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for diabetes, hypertension, concurrent smoking, or dyslipidemia.</p><p>In studies that included men and women, differences have been reported in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia between RA and the general population, although the evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other studies noted an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors in patients with RA, particularly in those with longstanding disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35</a>]. These data suggest that traditional risk factors do play a role, but may only explain a small portion of the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in RA.</p><p>Exercise of even moderate degree has a protective effect against coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality. For a variety of reasons, many patients with RA exercise less than recommended amounts, thereby possibly enhancing the risk of heart disease. As an example, a study of 298 Swedish patients with RA identified 47 percent whose physical activity did not comply with public health recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Markers of increased systemic inflammation are also associated with an increased risk of CAD. The best studied of these markers in the general population and in those with RA is the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP). In the Nurses' Health Study, for example, CRP levels were significantly higher in women with RA and heart disease versus those with heart disease but without RA (average CRP levels of 0.87 versus 0.34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>There are many other factors that may be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis in the general population.

Furthermore, the ability of HDL to extract cholesterol from lipid-laden atherosclerotic plaques is impaired in patients with active RA and improves when inflammation is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

However, the net effect on cardiovascular-related morbidity is unknown, given the antiinflammatory efficacy of these agents.</p><p/><p>There is also evidence for an interaction between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the level of inflammation in RA. In a longitudinal study of 487 patients with RA, a subset of patients experienced rapid progression of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), a marker for elevated cardiovascular risk, over a three-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. As expected, the predictors for rapid cIMT progression included both traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the baseline level of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In addition, there was a significant interaction between the number of cardiovascular risk factors and the ESR, as the risk of rapid progression was higher than would be expected by simply adding the risk from the traditional cardiovascular risk factors to that from the higher levels of inflammation alone. In a separate study, it was estimated that 30 percent of cardiovascular disease events in RA were driven by RA-specific clinical factors, such as disease activity and seropositivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145321565\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are typically similar to those without RA.

In a Swedish cohort study involving 1135 patients with RA and acute coronary syndrome identified in a nationwide database, the patients with RA presented more often with sudden cardiac death, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI), higher levels of troponin, and higher frequencies of inpatient complications, compared with patients in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>It is uncertain why patients with RA and CAD are less likely to report chest pain prior to or during a cardiovascular event. Possible explanations are that patients with active arthritis or those with structural joint damage may be less physically active, less likely to place sufficient demand on the heart to elicit angina, and more likely to attribute pain to RA, or it may be that use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) alters pain perception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145322297\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145322304\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of CAD in RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is generally similar in patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sternoclavicular joint arthritis &ndash; Painful sternoclavicular joint involvement with localized tenderness may be present in up to 7 percent of patients with established, generalized RA. Rarely, involvement of the sternoclavicular joint is the initial manifestation of RA. Establishing the diagnosis is usually not difficult, once considered, since point tenderness favors local inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Rheumatoid arthritis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericarditis &ndash; Acute painful pericarditis occurs in less than 10 percent of patients with RA during their lifetimes. Since small pericardial effusions are relatively common in patients without symptoms of pericarditis, caution is required in attributing chest pain to pericarditis based solely upon echocardiographic findings of an effusion. The major clinical manifestations of acute pericarditis are chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and the classic finding of widespread saddle-shaped or concave-up ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Increasingly, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to identify acute pericardial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herpes zoster &ndash; The likelihood of herpes zoster infection is increased in patients with RA receiving immunosuppressive medications, such as biologics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or high doses of glucocorticoids. It is characterized by a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption in a restricted dermatomal distribution. The diagnosis may be difficult prior to the appearance of the rash. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypertension &ndash; Exertional chest pain indistinguishable from that of angina pectoris may be a manifestation of pulmonary hypertension, a rare complication of interstitial lung disease in patients with RA. Clinical evidence suggesting right ventricular dysfunction, such as pulmonary artery dilation on plain chest radiography and characteristic echocardiographic findings, may help distinguish chest pain symptoms related to pulmonary hypertension from angina pectoris. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortitis &ndash; Aortitis is a rare complication of RA, which, when present, is typically accompanied by rheumatoid vasculitis in other vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Disease at the coronary ostia or associated coronary vasculitis can cause myocardial infarction (MI). Dilatation of the ascending aorta is a common initial finding. Thoracic aortic dissection or rupture could cause chest pain. A &quot;ripping&quot; or &quot;tearing&quot; quality to the pain, associated back pain, pulse deficits, a difference in limb blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg, and hemodynamic compromise are suggestive of aortic dissection. An imaging study such as transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, MR angiography, or contrast computed tomography (CT) is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall pain &ndash; Musculoskeletal pain in the chest wall is the most common cause of precordial chest pain in patients with RA and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the RA patient with chest pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased incidence of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarctions (MI) and cardiac deaths, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with the populations in which they live. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is postulated that the presence of chronic inflammation in RA may enhance the development of atherosclerosis. This may be the result of effects mediated by cytokines, immune complexes, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), endothelial dysfunction, or, rarely, coronary vasculitis. Abnormal functions of T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages have been implicated in promoting inflammation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation, and similarities may exist between synovial and vascular inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)-related events does not appear to be mediated entirely through traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Use of antiinflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors may contribute to increased risk for coronary thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some medications used in RA can adversely impact the lipoprotein profile, while simultaneously reducing vascular risk surrogates, including inflammatory markers. The net effect on cardiovascular <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite an increased incidence of ischemic cardiac events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of clinical angina pectoris in RA patients is lower than in the general population. Aside from this point, the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) are generally similar in patients with or without RA, but tend to be more severe in the patients with RA. (See <a href=\"#H145321565\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with RA &ge;50 years of age, we suggest yearly history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) to periodically assess for the presence of symptomatic CAD or electrocardiographic evidence of a silent MI. Exercise or pharmacologic stress testing is suggested for those with symptoms (eg, angina, atypical chest pain, exertional dyspnea) or electrocardiographic findings suggestive of CAD. (See <a href=\"#H51384270\" class=\"local\">'Screening for CAD in RA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in the general population, the differential diagnosis of chest pain in a patient with RA is broad. Some disorders that may be of particular interest are chest wall pain, pericarditis, Herpes zoster, pulmonary hypertension, and thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
