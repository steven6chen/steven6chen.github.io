The term factitious (or factitial) hypoglycemia has been used in medical parlance to imply covert human activity. The consideration of such a possibility often changes the patient-clinician relationship, leading the clinician to feel deceived and the patient to feel mistrusted. However, the pejorative connotation with which factitious illness has been encumbered requires softening because some patients with factitious disease suffer through no fault of their own.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of factitious hypoglycemia will be reviewed here. Other causes of hypoglycemia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF FACTITIOUS HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious hypoglycemia results from the use of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea, meglitinides) but not from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> or other insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ingestion of an oral insulin secretagogue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first reported case of factitious hypoglycemia related to a sulfonylurea was due to the surreptitious self-administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpropamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpropamide</a> by a patient without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inappropriate manipulation of hypoglycemic tablets by a patient with diabetes is another cause of factitious hypoglycemia.</p><p>In addition to patients who knowingly take insulin secretagogue drugs, there are patients who, by taking a prescribed medication in good faith, have hypoglycemia because a sulfonylurea was mistakenly dispensed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In most instances, confusion in dispensing the drug arose because of similarity in spelling between the intended medication and the sulfonylurea. The most common errors in early reports were the substitutions of Diabinese for Diamox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] and of Tolinase for Tolectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Hypoglycemia in an older person whose spouse is being treated with a hypoglycemic tablet is generally due to a mix-up in medication. It may also occur after ingestion of herbal products contaminated with sulfonylureas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, hypoglycemia has been reported after ingestion of illegal sexual enhancement drugs or herbal preparations (eg, Power 1 Walnut) contaminated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glyburide-glibenclamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glyburide</a> in amounts ranging from 13 to 100 mg per tablet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a case series from Singapore, seven patients who ingested such products were comatose secondary to prolonged neuroglycopenia, and four patients subsequently died.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration of insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Covert self-administration of insulin by a patient without diabetes and the inappropriate manipulation of insulin by a patient with diabetes are causes of factitious hypoglycemia.</p><p>Administration of a hypoglycemic agent by a parent to a child is an insidious form of child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In previous cases, the alleged perpetrator was the patient's mother who had ready access to insulin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Insulin has also been used to attempt suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A review of 97 published cases found that completed suicide occurred in 17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In most cases, those attempting suicide were insulin-treated patients with diabetes. There was equal gender distribution within this series and a wide distribution of age, ranging from 20 to 70 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients who knowingly self-administer hypoglycemic agents or in diabetic patients who manipulate their doses for the purpose of causing hypoglycemia is more common in women, occurs most commonly in the third or fourth decades of life, and, among nondiabetic subjects, is often found in those in health-related occupations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nondiabetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nondiabetic subjects with factitious hypoglycemia can present with a clinical syndrome that appears similar to insulinoma; as a result, many of them have undergone futile abdominal exploration and needless subtotal pancreatectomy in search of an insulinoma. The appropriate application and interpretation of available tests will preclude surgical exploration in them. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious hypoglycemia among patients with diabetes is probably more common than the incidence noted in published series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/17,18,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,20-22</a>]. Patients with diabetes are trained to manipulate doses of insulin for the purpose of achieving goal blood glucose values. When manipulation goes awry in the patient with factitious hypoglycemia, confirmation of the correct diagnosis can be very difficult.</p><p>Patients with diabetes and factitious hypoglycemia usually appear to have brittle diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. They typically have repeated episodes of hypoglycemia despite a reduction in dose or even cessation of insulin therapy. Although insulinoma is an extraordinarily rare event in patients with diabetes, several patients with diabetes have undergone needless pancreatic exploration and resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. When truly deprived of access to hypoglycemic agents, diabetic patients with factitious hypoglycemia become hyperglycemic.</p><p>The identification of factitious disease as a cause of brittle diabetes requires three factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinician who suspects the diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the brittle diabetic state in a controlled environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close patient follow-up to document manipulative behavior</p><p/><p>Careful studies of patients with brittle diabetes have shown that psychological problems play a major role in the swings in blood glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adult-patient-with-brittle-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adult patient with brittle diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of factitious hypoglycemia should be considered in every patient undergoing evaluation for a hypoglycemic disorder, especially when the hypoglycemia has a chaotic occurrence, ie, no relation at all to meals or fasting. All medications, including herbal preparations or other over-the-counter products, should be identified. The assistance of a pharmacist is desirable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In persons for whom insulin or an oral insulin secretagogue has not been prescribed, the diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia can usually be established by documenting the presence of hypoglycemia and by simultaneously measuring plasma insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea and meglitinides).</p><p>Performance of a 72-hour fast, which is primarily used to diagnose insulinoma, may be required in patients with factitious hypoglycemia should a spontaneous episode of hypoglycemia not be observed. Of course, the fast may be negative if the patient does not take the offending agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on '72-hour fast'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interpretation of the test results is the same as when the tests are done during a spontaneous episode of hypoglycemia or during a 72-hour fast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin secretagogues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factitious hypoglycemia caused by sulfonylureas or meglitinides biochemically mimics the insulinoma response since these drugs stimulate insulin secretion. Patients with insulinoma and insulin secretagogue-induced hypoglycemia can have plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin values above or within the normal overnight fasting range. These ranges, however, are too high for the low plasma glucose concentration. In such cases, the detection of sulfonylureas or meglitinides in the plasma confirms the diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Exogenous insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In individuals with factitious hypoglycemia caused by exogenous administration of insulin, plasma insulin values are high (often above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">microU/mL),</span> whereas plasma C-peptide and proinsulin values are low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>There are, however, caveats to the interpretation of plasma insulin values:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hypoglycemia caused by synthetic insulin analogs (eg, glargine, detemir, lispro, aspart), insulin concentrations may be low, depending upon the insulin assay used. Clinical suspicion should guide subsequent testing of the sample obtained at the time of hypoglycemia against a panel of antibodies to insulin capable of detecting various analogs. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Insulin measurements'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In autoimmune hypoglycemia, both the plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations can be very high, with plasma insulin levels often well above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microU/mL</span> (6000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span>. In addition to the difference in C-peptide concentration (high with autoimmune hypoglycemia and low with exogenous insulin), the presence of insulin antibodies in high titers can distinguish insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia from exogenous insulin administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 1</a>). The antibodies do not have to be measured during an episode of hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Anti-insulin antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some insulin assays detect only human insulin, whereas others detect both human insulin and synthetic insulin analogs (glargine, detemir, lispro, aspart) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In addition, some assays have been developed to specifically measure insulin analogs (eg, lispro, aspart) or animal insulin (porcine, beef) without any crossreactivity with human insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Assay specificity depends upon the selection of monoclonal antibody used for detection. Thus, it is important that the clinician knows which insulin assay is used and whether it measures human insulin, insulin analogs, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin secretagogue measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all hypoglycemic patients, except those with type 1 diabetes, plasma should be obtained during a hypoglycemic episode for the measurement of sulfonylureas and meglitinides (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nateglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nateglinide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repaglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">repaglinide</a>).</p><p>Many techniques for detection of first-generation sulfonylureas do not detect second-generation sulfonylureas or meglitinides. It is therefore important that the laboratory selected to make this measurement has a proven record with the assay and fastidious quality control procedures. The Department of Laboratory Medicine at the Mayo Clinic developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry <span class=\"nowrap\">(LC/MS/MS)</span> method that has proven to be highly sensitive for the detection of these compounds (sulfonylureas and meglitinides). Similar type assays are available in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays are also available for detecting surreptitious abuse of sulfonylureas or meglitinides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>The misdiagnosis of insulinoma or insulin secretagogue factitious hypoglycemia is doubly injurious, depriving the patient of a potentially curative procedure (if the diagnosis of insulinoma is missed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] or leading to unnecessary surgery (if the diagnosis of insulin secretagogue use is missed).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">C-peptide measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic patients, the distinction between an endogenous or exogenous source of insulin can be made by measuring plasma C-peptide in the sample used for the insulin determination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Isolated measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide are diagnostically useless. Interpretation of the value for any one of these substances is dependent upon the values of the other two. Insulin and C-peptide are secreted in an equimolar fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]; as a result, the plasma concentrations of these two peptides parallel each other in patients with endogenous hyperinsulinemia.</p><p>In contrast, the plasma concentrations of the two peptides are inversely related in patients with exogenous insulin factitious hypoglycemia: plasma insulin is high while C-peptide is appropriately suppressed, usually close to the lower limit of detection of the C-peptide assay. This observation applies to both nondiabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/15,18,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,43</a>] and to those with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/17,18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,22</a>]. Patients with type 1 diabetes are characteristically severely insulin deficient and have low or undetectable plasma concentrations of C-peptide. Although the C-peptide values in these patients cannot be further suppressed, confirmation that they are low during hypoglycemia eliminates any consideration of endogenous hyperinsulinism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/21,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-insulin antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the presence of anti-insulin antibodies in nondiabetic patients or patients with diabetes who had never been treated with insulin was taken as evidence favoring the surreptitious use of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the syndrome of autoimmune hypoglycemia in which insulin antibodies are spontaneously generated has complicated this interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/28,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,45</a>]. Patients with this disorder have high plasma titers of insulin antibodies and a history of autoimmune disease or exposure to sulfhydryl-containing drugs.

Human insulin generates antibodies in fewer patients and in lower titers (50 percent lower) than does purified porcine insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factitious-hypoglycemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The presence of anti-insulin antibodies can interfere with measurements of plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations.
