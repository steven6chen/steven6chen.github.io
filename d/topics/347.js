Abortive treatments are usually more effective if they are given early in the course of the headache; a large single dose tends to work better than repetitive small doses. Many oral agents are ineffective because of poor absorption secondary to migraine-induced gastric stasis.</p><p>General recommendations for the treatment of acute migraine include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educate migraine sufferers about their condition and its treatment and encourage them to participate in their own management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use migraine specific agents (eg, triptans, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dihydroergotamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dihydroergotamine</a>) in patients with more severe migraine and in those whose headaches respond poorly to NSAIDs or combination analgesics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Select a nonoral route of administration for patients whose migraines present early with significant nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider a self-administered rescue medication for patients with severe migraines that do not respond well to other treatments</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guard against medication overuse headache by educating patients about risk and using prophylactic medications in patients with frequent headaches (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>The early use of migraine-specific medications for severe attacks provided the best outcomes in a randomized, controlled trial of 835 adults with migraine that compared these strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A second group (step care across attacks) received initial treatment with aspirin (800 to 1000 mg) plus metoclopramide (10 mg); patients not responding in at least two of the first three attacks switched to zolmitriptan (2.5 mg) for the next three attacks. In a third group (stratified care), patients with mild headaches were treated with aspirin plus metoclopramide, while those with more severe headaches were treated with zolmitriptan. The latter two groups had significantly better outcomes than the first group as measured by headache response and disability time, although patients in the stratified group had the greatest number of adverse events.</p><p>The pharmacologic approach to migraine is directed mainly by the severity of the attacks, the presence of associated nausea and vomiting, the treatment setting (outpatient or medical care facility), and patient-specific factors, such as the presence of vascular risk factors and drug preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68879808\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild to moderate attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mild to moderate migraine attacks not associated with vomiting or severe nausea, simple analgesics (NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) or combination analgesics are first choice agents because they are effective, less expensive, and less likely to cause adverse effects than migraine-specific agents such as triptans or ergots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Pain freedom at two hours post-treatment was significantly greater with the TMS device compared with sham stimulation (39 versus 22 percent, absolute risk reduction 17 percent, 95% CI 3-31 percent). Furthermore, significance for a sustained pain-free response was maintained at both 24 and 48 hours. There were no serious adverse events related to use of the device.</p><p>The portable TMS device is available in the United Kingdom and selected centers in the United States, but more data are needed to confirm the benefit of this treatment for episodic migraine. The TMS device may prove to be useful as a second-line intervention for those who have episodic migraine with aura that does not respond to first-line therapy with triptans or other agents discussed above or who are unable to take these agents because of contraindications or intolerance. TMS should not be used to treat migraine for patients who have epilepsy, since there is theoretical concern that TMS could trigger seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134381582\"><span class=\"h1\">INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of novel drugs are under investigation for the treatment of migraine, including calcitonin-gene related peptide receptor antagonists and serotonin 1F receptor agonists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">CGRP receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic modulation of calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) activity offers the promise of future treatment options for acute migraine attacks.

There are no efficacy data that definitively support use of one triptan versus another; different pharmacologic properties and delivery routes may help guide the choice.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Factors predicting response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many oral agents are ineffective in migraine because of poor absorption secondary to migraine-induced gastric stasis.
