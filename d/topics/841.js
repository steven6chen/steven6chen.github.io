In this latter case a &quot;double set-up&quot; rapid sequence intubation, preferably with a video laryngoscope and surgical airway backup are reasonable alternatives. Failed attempts at intubation can lead to complete airway obstruction and fatality. Therefore, upper airway closure in the setting of anaphylaxis should be managed by the most proficient clinician available. This may require immediate collaboration between an emergency medicine specialist and an anesthesiologist, otolaryngologist, or intensivist with training and experience in the management of the difficult airway, but delay should not occur while seeking consultation.

At the onset of an anaphylactic episode, it is not possible to predict how severe it will become, how rapidly it will progress, and whether it will resolve promptly and completely or not, because the factors that determine the course of anaphylaxis in an individual patient are not fully understood.

The risk of recurrence has been estimated in several retrospective studies of different patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment/abstract/22,23,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,97,98</a>]. In a prospective study of nearly 300 children with anaphylaxis requiring acute medical care (predominantly caused by foods), the annual recurrence rate was 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Concomitant asthma and the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to treat the initial episode further increased the risk of recurrence. Thus, it is important to equip patients with epinephrine autoinjectors and arrange appropriate referrals in a timely manner after the initial event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4063727599\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Anaphylaxis appears to be most responsive to treatment in its early phases, before shock has developed, based on the observation that delayed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> injection is associated with fatalities. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Immediate management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management is summarized in rapid overview tables for adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58346 \">table 1</a>) and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74242 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Immediate management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> is life-saving in anaphylaxis. It should be injected as early as possible in the episode in order to prevent progression of symptoms and signs. <strong>There are no absolute contraindications to epinephrine use, and it is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis of any severity</strong>. We recommend epinephrine for patients with apparently mild symptoms and signs (eg, a few hives and mild wheezing) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), as well as for patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms and signs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Epinephrine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The route of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> administration depends upon the presenting symptoms. For patients who are <strong>not</strong> profoundly hypotensive or in shock or cardiorespiratory arrest, <strong>intramuscular (IM) injection into the mid-outer thigh</strong> as the initial route of administration is advised, in preference to subcutaneous administration or intravenous (IV) administration. (See <a href=\"#H1766658863\" class=\"local\">'Intramuscular epinephrine injection (preferred)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When an exact dose can be drawn up and administered, 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (maximum of 0.5 mg) should be administered in the mid-outer thigh every 5 to 15 minutes or more frequently if necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When an autoinjector is used, children weighing less than 25 kg should receive the 0.15 mg dose, and those weighing over 25 kg should receive the 0.3 mg dose administered to the outer thigh every 5 to 15 minutes or more frequently if necessary. Autoinjector use must be carefully considered in infants and children weighing under 7.5 kg. However, the benefits likely outweigh the risk if this is the only source of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive fluid shifts can occur in anaphylaxis, and all patients with orthostasis, hypotension, or incomplete response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should receive large volume fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Normotensive patients should receive normal saline to maintain venous access in case their status deteriorates. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental oxygen and bronchodilators should be administered to patients with respiratory signs or symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is indicated for patients with profound hypotension or symptoms and signs suggestive of impending shock (dizziness, incontinence of urine or stool) who do not respond to initial IM injections of epinephrine and fluid resuscitation. For these patients, we suggest that epinephrine be administered by continuous slow IV infusion rather than by intermittent IV bolus (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Slow IV infusion is less likely to cause extreme hypertension or ventricular arrhythmias. Epinephrine infusion should be accompanied by continuous electronic hemodynamic monitoring. Specific guidance for creating the proper epinephrine solutions is provided. (See <a href=\"#H464630712\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous epinephrine continuous infusion and indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients successfully treated for anaphylaxis should be discharged with a personalized written anaphylaxis emergency action plan, an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector, written information about anaphylaxis and its treatment, and a plan for further evaluation by an allergist. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Care upon resolution'</a> above and <a href=\"#H44\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be evaluated further to confirm the cause, as specific avoidance measures are useful in reducing the risk of recurrence.
