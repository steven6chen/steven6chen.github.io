Up to 10 percent of all patients and 15 percent of hospitalized patients report some type of penicillin allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Upon thorough evaluation, many of these patients are found <strong>not</strong> to be allergic and are able to safely receive penicillin. However, penicillins are among the leading causes of drug-induced anaphylaxis, including fatalities. Thus, a systematic approach to the evaluation of penicillin allergy is necessary.</p><p>This topic reviews immediate allergic reactions to penicillins, which are most often defined as reactions that develop within minutes to one hour of administration. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of immediate reactions to penicillins will be discussed here.

The classification and pathogenesis of drug allergies are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3592171\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate versus delayed reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended categorizing immunologic drug reactions based upon the timing of the appearance of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This system defines two broad categories of reactions: immediate and delayed. This approach is intended to distinguish immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated (type I reactions), which account for many immediate reactions, from other types, because IgE-mediated reactions carry the risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis if the patient is re-exposed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediate reactions</strong> classically begin within one hour of the last administered dose and may begin within minutes. However, some immediate reactions appear after one hour, particularly if the drug was administered orally or taken with food. For these reasons, some guidelines include reactions beginning up to six hours after the last administered dose in the immediate category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nevertheless, the period of one hour identifies most immediate reactions. When allergic sensitization first develops, the initial symptoms may appear during the latter days of treatment (ie, not following the first dose of the course) but usually within one hour of the last administered dose and then escalate rapidly with any successive doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed reactions</strong> appear after multiple doses of treatment, typically after days or weeks of administration. Most delayed reactions begin after six hours and typically after days of treatment. As an example, delayed reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> classically start on day 7 to 10 of treatment and may even begin one to three days after cessation of treatment. Delayed reactions are more common than immediate reactions. They may be caused by several different mechanisms, but they are not IgE-mediated. Delayed reactions to penicillins are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Delayed hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11061822\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin allergy can develop at any age. Some type of penicillin reaction is reported by 5 to 10 percent of patients, although in large scale studies of penicillin skin testing, more than 90 percent of these individuals are found not to have positive skin tests and are able to tolerate penicillins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. In addition, the prevalence of immediate reactions to penicillin appears to have declined in the United States over the last two decades based on the rate of positive penicillin skin tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Anaphylaxis, the most severe manifestation of immediate penicillin reactions, may be defined as a severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Multiple fatalities from penicillin-induced anaphylaxis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Penicillin-induced anaphylaxis occurs with an incidence of between one and four episodes per 10,000 administrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,15</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin</a> and penicillin were the leading cause of severe antibiotic-induced anaphylaxis in one large database, probably because these drugs are so commonly administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the United States, it has been estimated that 500 to 1000 deaths per year are due to penicillin-induced anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis, from all causes, is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>No studies have prospectively evaluated the rates at which patients become sensitized (ie, develop penicillin-specific immunoglobulin E [IgE]) during penicillin treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11062485\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of risk factors have been identified for the development of immediate reactions to penicillin and antibiotics in general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; Patients between the ages of 20 and 49 appear to be at greatest risk of having immediate allergic (particularly anaphylactic) reactions to penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This observation may reflect age-dependent differences in immune responses to medications or may be an artifact related to usage patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frequent, repeated exposure</strong> &ndash; Frequent, repeated courses of penicillins appear to favor the development of allergic sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is supported by the observation that patients with cystic fibrosis (who require frequent treatment with intravenous antibiotics) are particularly prone to developing IgE-mediated antibiotic allergies, although prospective studies are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Route of administration</strong> &ndash; Parenteral administration seems to have a higher rate of sensitization compared with oral administration and is more likely to result in anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The vast majority of anaphylactic deaths have occurred in patients treated with intravenous or intramuscular, rather than oral, penicillins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Dose may also be a factor in such cases, since parenteral doses are often higher than those administered orally. Topically-applied penicillin is highly sensitizing and has not been in clinical use for decades for that reason.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple antibiotic allergy syndrome</strong> &ndash; The term &quot;multiple antibiotic allergy syndrome&quot; may be assigned to individuals who have experienced allergic reactions (either IgE- or non-IgE-mediated) to two or more non-cross-reacting antibiotics. A number of studies support the theory that patients who develop an allergy to one medication are more likely to react to a second unrelated compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. The reasons why certain patients have a heightened propensity to generate allergic reactions to drugs have not been identified, but could include genetic as well as exposure factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary factors</strong> &ndash; While genetic factors may play a role in penicillin and other antibiotic allergies, first-degree relatives of patients with penicillin allergy do <strong>not</strong> need to avoid penicillins empirically. Evidence for genetic factors in the development of penicillin allergy includes an association between particular HLA-DRB genotypes and IgE-mediated penicillin allergy in Chinese populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Additional evidence for hereditary factors comes from retrospective, survey-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. For example, children of parents who reported an antibiotic allergy were 15 times more likely to be antibiotic-allergic (by history) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the results of survey-based studies are limited by a reliance on patient history (which is known to be a poor predictor of drug allergy) and by lack of confirmatory testing or provocative challenges.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other allergic diseases</strong> &ndash; Patients with other allergic diseases (such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, or food allergies) do <strong>not </strong>appear to be at higher risk for becoming sensitized (ie, developing drug-specific IgE) to penicillin compared with people without allergic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/8,11,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,30-32</a>]. However, once sensitized, patients with asthma (in particular) are at greater risk for serious reactions and anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Occupational exposure</strong> &ndash; Exposure to penicillins in occupational settings (health care, laboratory workers) can result in sensitization, although it is unclear how often this results in clinical allergy. Immediate reactions, as well as asthma, contact urticaria, and contact dermatitis are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136350979\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin allergy resolves with time in many (but not all) patients who successfully avoid penicillin. This is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1968145\" class=\"local\">'Time elapsed since the reaction'</a> below.)</p><p>Another clinical question that occasionally arises in patients who have been determined not to be allergic despite a history of a reaction in the past, is whether penicillin allergy can recur if the patient is given penicillins again. This appears to be rare, and it is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing#H346228419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;, section on 'Resensitization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965034\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many immediate reactions are type I, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions. This type of reaction usually presents with various combinations of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria (intensely pruritic, raised, red plaques that appear and resolve within hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72519 \">picture 1</a>))</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchospasm (wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, or repetitive dry cough)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal edema (throat tightness or change in voice quality)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distress (cramping, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension</p><p/><p>The full spectrum of signs and symptoms possible with immediate reactions, both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated, is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Some of the features of immediate reaction, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema, can also be seen in delayed reactions to penicillins. However, if a patient reports a pruritic rash or urticaria or angioedema, an evaluation for an immediate reaction is indicated. Mild, skin-limited reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> in young children are often not IgE-mediated. Studies of this population are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions#H279796926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Delayed hypersensitivity reactions&quot;, section on 'Delayed urticarial eruptions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions#H1503932997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Delayed hypersensitivity reactions&quot;, section on 'Studies in children'</a>.)</p><p>If a penicillin reaction is witnessed, it is extremely helpful to record the details of the reaction in the patient's medical record, including the time from the last administered dose to the first symptoms, the observed signs and symptoms, and severity. These details are invaluable to clinicians treating the patient in the future. In addition, if the patient develops a severe reaction that appears to be anaphylaxis, a serum tryptase (collected one to three hours of the onset of the reaction) may reveal an elevation in total tryptase, which indicates massive activation of mast cells and is very specific (although not sensitive) for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H4053318931\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965552\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type I reactions require the presence of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). A small percentage of patients form drug-specific IgE upon exposure to a medication, while most do not. Penicillin in the intact form is not very allergenic, but under physiologic conditions, penicillins spontaneously degrade to a number of reactive intermediates that covalently bind to carrier proteins in the tissue and serum. These complexes of breakdown products and proteins are multivalent and thus more allergenic and can trigger the formation of drug-specific IgE through the coordinated actions of B cells and T helper cells. These interactions, in conjunction with T cell-derived cytokines, enable B cells to mature and secrete drug-specific IgE molecules, which diffuse through the circulation and attach to the surface of mast cells and basophils throughout the body.</p><p>The production of drug-specific IgE and its binding to mast cells and basophils is called sensitization and is clinically asymptomatic. As with other forms of IgE-mediated allergy, having formed drug-specific IgE puts the patient at risk for an IgE-mediated drug reaction, but does not guarantee that one will occur. In other words, drug-specific IgE is necessary, but not sufficient, for an IgE-mediated reaction. The other factors that must be present for a reaction to occur are not known.</p><p>When a<strong> </strong>sensitized individual is given the penicillin again, the drug again degrades and couples to serum and tissue proteins. This time, if the <span class=\"nowrap\">drug/carrier</span> protein complexes interact with and cross-link enough drug-specific IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils, the cells can activate. Sudden and widespread activation of mast cells and basophils can result in release of an array of vasoactive mediators, which in turn, cause the signs and symptoms of an immediate reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347081681\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most allergic patients, the principal immune response is <strong>not</strong> directed against the penicillin molecule in its native state. Instead, the immune response is against new antigenic determinants that are formed once the penicillin molecule degrades and binds to serum and tissue proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>The allergenic components of penicillins are found either in the core ring structure that is common to all penicillins (as well as cephalosporins and carbapenems) or (much less commonly) within side chains (called R groups) that distinguish different penicillins from one another. The portion of the molecule to which the patient has made IgE antibodies determines patterns of cross-reactivity with other related drugs. A detailed understanding of the structure of these drugs is required to interpret skin test results and predict cross-reactivity patterns. This is reviewed briefly here and in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing#H27040356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;, section on 'Skin testing reagents and concentrations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965559\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergens arising from the beta-lactam core</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The beta-lactam ring of penicillins is inherently unstable, and after administration, it spontaneously degrades into intermediates that form complexes by binding to cell-bound or serum proteins. One such complex is penicilloyl, which is called the &quot;major determinant&quot; because most of the penicillin covalently links with lysine residues in common proteins. A synthetic preparation of the major determinant (penicilloyl polylysine) is commercially available for use in skin testing. The remaining parts of the penicillin molecule undergo a similar process and form other complexes. As a group, these are called the &quot;minor determinants,&quot; and only about 10 percent of allergic patients are believed to be reactive to these. One proallergen for the minor determinants is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> itself, which can be allergenic through multiple protein interactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing#H27040356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;, section on 'Skin testing reagents and concentrations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1965566\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergens arising from side chains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients form IgE antibodies that recognize the R-group side chains rather than the core ring structure.

This is initially taken by the generalist, who can sometimes exclude immediate allergy based on history alone. The generalist then decides if the patient should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation and how urgently this should occur. These initial steps in the evaluation are depicted in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100745\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100745 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>In most situations, the allergist will perform skin testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If skin testing is positive in a history-positive patient, then the allergy is confirmed (ie, evidence of continued skin test reactivity), and the patient must continue to avoid penicillins unless <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is given the penicillin using a desensitization protocol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If skin testing is negative, it is followed by challenge to assure (in a safe environment) that the drug is tolerated and can be used in the future.

However, findings of a study question the utility of the available in vitro immunoassays. In a prospective series of 150 consecutive patients with a history of penicillin allergy, both skin testing and in vitro ImmunoCAP testing were performed, followed by oral challenge if skin test was negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

There were six skin test-positive patients (none of whom were also ImmunoCAP-positive), who were not challenged.

However, desensitizations are often performed in hospitalized patients requiring parenteral medications, because it is in this setting that patients with few remaining options for therapy are usually encountered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1969545\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization should be considered in patients who are proven (by positive skin testing or in vitro tests) or are strongly suspected to have an immediate, IgE-mediated penicillin allergy <strong>and</strong> for whom there are no acceptable alternate antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11063544\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization should not be attempted in patients with histories of blistering reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), because even small doses of the drug may induce severe progressive reactions. Desensitization is also not appropriate for patients with histories of hemolytic anemia or interstitial nephritis, because these reactions depend upon immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and cannot be &quot;desensitized&quot; by this method.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1969552\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is <strong>strongly recommended that desensitizations be performed by allergy specialists</strong>, because experience is essential in managing breakthrough symptoms and adjusting the protocol appropriately. The main risk during a desensitization procedure is that of a recurrent immediate reaction. Most reactions are mild and less severe than the patient's initial reaction, although significant reactions, including anaphylaxis, do occur.</p><p>In experienced hands, desensitization is safe and effective. Desensitizations are usually performed in the hospital, and often in the intensive care setting because it is critical to have the staffing and equipment available to manage anaphylaxis. However, oral desensitization to penicillin has been performed by allergy specialists in the outpatient setting as well, with one-on-one nursing and intravenous access. Penicillin desensitization has also been safely performed in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. We know of no published fatalities resulting from failed penicillin desensitization procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-pregnancy#H2268642049\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Desensitization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622418804\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-desensitization care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of drug desensitization for immediate reactions are temporary. After the drug is cleared from the body, the patient's allergy returns and continued avoidance is essential. If a penicillin is needed again, it must be given by desensitization (if it is needed in the near future) or if years elapse before it is needed, the patient must be re-evaluated to determine if the allergy is still present. It is critical to ensure that the patient understands this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2893673399\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic reactions to penicillins may be categorized based on the time of onset of symptoms. Reactions that begin within minutes to one hour of administration are classified as &quot;immediate.&quot; Although there are exceptions, this definition is intended to capture the majority of type I, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of immediate reactions include flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypotension. An array of symptoms may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1965034\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The allergenic components of penicillins are found either in the core ring structure that is common to all penicillins (as well as cephalosporins and carbapenems) or (much less commonly) within side chains (called R groups) that distinguish different penicillins from one another. The portion of the molecule to which the patient has made IgE antibodies determines patterns of cross-reactivity with other related drugs. A detailed understanding of the structure of these drugs is required to interpret skin test results and predict cross-reactivity patterns. (See <a href=\"#H1965552\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of immediate allergic sensitivity to penicillin is based on clinical history, skin testing when available, and sometimes graded challenge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100745\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100745 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H11063066\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The time elapsed since the patient's last reaction is important in assessing the risk of a recurrent reaction, as patients with IgE-mediated allergy may lose the sensitivity over time if they are not re-exposed. Only 20 percent of patients with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy remain allergic after 10 years of avoidance. (See <a href=\"#H1968131\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Penicillin skin testing is the preferred method of evaluating patients with possible immediate reactions because it is rapid, sensitive, and associated with minimal patient discomfort, although referral is needed because this type of testing is usually performed by allergy specialists. (See <a href=\"#H347080234\" class=\"local\">'Penicillin skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In vitro tests such as immunoassays for penicillin-specific IgE or basophil activation tests (BATs) are inferior to skin testing and are of limited value. (See <a href=\"#H347080291\" class=\"local\">'In vitro testing and limitations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If skin testing is not available and an equivalent alternative antimicrobial does not exist, patients with a low likelihood of allergy based upon clinical history, time elapsed since the reaction, and possible in vitro testing, may be diagnosed via graded challenge. Patients who tolerate graded challenge prove that they are not acutely allergic. Challenges should be performed in a setting equipped with the staff and resources to treat possible allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H347080377\" class=\"local\">'Graded challenge (test dosing)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with past immediate reactions who are found to remain sensitive, either by skin testing or challenge, the options for future treatment include use of unrelated antibiotics (ie, avoidance of penicillins) or treatment with penicillins via desensitization. (See <a href=\"#H1969463\" class=\"local\">'Options for future treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lee CE, Zembower TR, Fotis MA, et al.
