The diagnosis is straightforward in many patients due to a history of contact with caterpillars or moths followed closely by the onset of symptoms. </p><p>Most sting and hypersensitivity reactions are mild and self-limited and can be managed with measures for symptomatic relief. In contrast, patients with lonomism often require inpatient supportive care and prompt medical intervention.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of lepidopterism will be reviewed here. Bites and stings from other insects are reviewed separately.

Because many reactions are self-limited and mild, and because many human-insect encounters occur in tropical areas with poor health care access, lepidopterism is probably underreported.&nbsp;</p><p>Most episodes of lepidopterism are isolated and sporadic; however, temporal, occupational, and geographic factors may influence risk for development. Several medically important species are periodically subject to dramatic variation in density, resulting in infestations of large numbers of caterpillars or moths and subsequent outbreaks of coincident cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Individuals who work in rural areas (eg, forestry workers, farmers, entomologists, and gardeners), particularly during warmer months, are at higher risk of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. Outbreaks of hypersensitivity reactions to Lepidoptera have also been reported in urban and suburban environments, particularly near parks or schools with heavily infested trees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. </p><p>In areas where processionary caterpillars (<em>Thaumetopoea</em> spp) are present, cutaneous reactions can be frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In a survey of 1224 adults in an endemic area for the pine processionary moth (<em>Thaumetopoea pityocampa</em>) in Spain, the estimated point prevalences of cutaneous reactions to this species were 12, 10, and 4 percent among inhabitants of rural, semi-urban, and urban areas, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

These caterpillars are covered in dense fur that hides pairs of highly venomous spines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112003\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112003 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p/><p>The content of caterpillar venom (with the exception of <em>Lonomia</em>) is poorly studied.

Typical symptoms include mild to moderate stinging or burning pain that is associated with welts, vesicles, or red papules and plaques at the site of envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Characteristically, the paired spines of <em>Megalopyge</em> (flannel moth) caterpillars cause a grid-like or &quot;tram-track&quot; pattern of hemorrhagic papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F113001\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113001 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>Pain usually persists for minutes to a few hours. Occasionally, pain is severe or incapacitating, particularly from stings of <em>Megalopyge</em> species. Stings from caterpillars of the southern flannel moth (<em>Megalopyge opercularis</em>, also called the asp or puss caterpillar) may result in severe radiating pain, swelling of the affected limb, and occasionally systemic symptoms such as headache, fever, adenopathy, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, or chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518278628\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is made based upon a history of contact with a stinging caterpillar and consistent clinical manifestations. Recognition of the classic &quot;tram-track&quot; pattern of hemorrhagic papules is helpful for diagnosis of <em>Megalopyge</em> stings.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for caterpillar stings includes envenomation by other insects, including bees and wasps, snakes, or other animal bites. In many cases, it is impossible to distinguish these entities without appropriate history.

Setae may help to protect the soft-bodied larvae against predators. Numerous families of Lepidoptera utilize this defensive technique, including common species such as the gypsy moth caterpillar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112004\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112004 \">picture 5</a>), wooly bear caterpillar, tussock moth caterpillars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112005 \">picture 6</a>), and processionary caterpillars. Exposure to setae on <em>Hylesia</em> moths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112006\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112006 \">picture 7</a>) also can cause a hypersensitivity reaction (&quot;Caripito itch&quot; or &quot;papillonite&quot;), with occurrences reported in Venezuela; French Guiana; Cozumel, Mexico; Brazil; Argentina; Uruguay; Guyana; and Peru. Contact with <em>Euproctis</em> moths in Singapore has caused similar symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Reactions typically occur after direct contact with caterpillars or moths. However, when offensive moths or caterpillars are found in high numbers, their setae can be transported by wind or other fomites (towels, clothing, etc), causing symptoms without known direct contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/6,10,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11,14</a>]. In particular, processionary caterpillar setae may last in soil, on tree bark, or embedded in silk cocoons spun by the caterpillar and cause reactions months after caterpillars are found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Setae from <em>Hylesia</em> species can be found on egg masses; abdominal setae on female <em>Hylesia</em> moths are transferred to eggs for protection.</p><p>The pathophysiology behind these reactions is poorly understood and may vary from species to species. In some cases, it is likely that symptoms result from a combination of mechanical irritation and a mixed type <span class=\"nowrap\">I/type</span> IV hypersensitivity reaction. The chitinous setae penetrate the skin and minute amounts of protein allergen are thus exposed to the immune system, resulting in allergic reactions. Processionary caterpillar setae are sharp and barbed and contain at least seven separate proteins capable of inducing an allergic response. An immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent immediate wheal formation from <em>T. pityocampa</em> (pine processionary caterpillar) extract prick testing has been repeatedly demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/8,9,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,25-27</a>]. Setae and setae extracts have also been shown to stimulate T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3952645106\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, symptoms are described as itchy papules, urticarial wheals, or a pruritic dermatitis that occurs within minutes or hours after contact and lasts for one to several days. Exposed areas such as the hands, feet, neck, and face are often affected preferentially (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112315%7EDERM%2F112316%7EDERM%2F112317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112315 graphicRef112316 graphicRef112317 \">picture 8A-C</a>). In some patients, reactions are severe and widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/2,3,5,6,8,10-12,26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,6,8,10-12,26,29,30</a>].

Contact with mucous membranes (eg, when a child puts a caterpillar in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> mouth or from airborne setae) may cause dysphagia, erythema, pain, edema, drooling, pruritus, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, and shortness of breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/2,8,10-12,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,10-12,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2530522495\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a caterpillar hypersensitivity reaction is typically straightforward, with onset of symptoms within a few hours of contact with caterpillars or moths, often confined to the area of contact. However, where infestation is heavy, environmental contamination with offensive setae may cause widespread symptoms even without direct contact. In this situation, a high index of suspicion is needed for diagnosis.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes other causes of allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and scabies. If symptoms are persistent, patch testing may be needed to evaluate for occult contact dermatitis. Examination for burrows and skin scraping can be used to exclude scabies infestation.

There are at least 11 species of <em>Lonomia</em>, and it is unknown whether contact with other species causes similar pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Expected laboratory findings include low or absent fibrinogen levels, low plasminogen levels, and low levels of factors V, VIII, and XIII. Profound reduction in factor XIII is common in <em>L. achelous</em> envenomation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39</a>]. Other laboratory abnormalities associated with lonomism include increased fibrinogen degradation products, increased thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and occasionally increased von Willebrand factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>].

Renal function may be reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Lonomism can resemble hereditary bleeding disorders, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or snakebite envenomation. Hereditary bleeding disorders usually can be identified by a history of recurrent bleeding, including hemarthrosis, epistaxis, and menorrhagia. DIC is due to an underlying disorder, such as malignancy, sepsis, trauma, or obstetrical complication. DIC may be differentiated by identification of the underlying disorder and by the presence of thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia, both of which are uncommon in lonomism. The venom of many snake species can cause consumptive coagulopathy very similar to lonomism.

Narcotics are rarely indicated, even after <em>Megalopyge</em> stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity reactions</strong> &ndash; A variety of interventions aimed at reducing symptoms have seemed helpful in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]; however, there are insufficient data to confirm efficacy. If symptom relief is needed, patients with urticarial reactions may benefit from oral antihistamines. Topical antipruritic agents (eg, agents containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramoxine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=camphor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">camphor</a>, or menthol) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a two-week course of a medium to high-potency topical corticosteroid may be tried for pruritus associated with other hypersensitivity eruptions. Patients with widespread or severe skin involvement can be given a short course of oral glucocorticoids (eg, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> taper given over 7 to 10 days). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lonomism</strong> &ndash; Treatment of lonomism typically requires inpatient supportive care and consultation with a hematologist. Rapid administration of an antilonomic serum developed in Brazil for envenomation by <em>L. obliqua </em>appears effective for reversing coagulation time and may reduce fatalities, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/32,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38</a>]. An analysis of data from a cohort of patients in southern Brazil with complications from contact with <em>L. obliqua</em> between 1989 and 2003 found fewer fatalities after antilonomic serum was introduced to treatment regimens. Among the 175 patients managed without antilonomic serum prior to 1995, seven (4 percent) died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In contrast, after 1995, when all patients were treated with antilonomic serum, none of 1892 patients died.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The antilonomic serum (heterologous immunoglobulin against <em>L. obliqua</em> venom) is given intravenously in a single treatment session. Limited data preclude definitive conclusions on the optimal administration. A Brazilian trial in which 44 patients who developed laboratory evidence of hemorrhagic syndrome (with or without clinical signs of hemorrhage) after contact with <em>L. obliqua</em> were randomly assigned to either 10.5 mg or 17.5 mg of antilonomic serum found similar laboratory and clinical outcomes for patients in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. No important complications occurred in either group, and all patients recovered completely. Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid complications are potential risks of this therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">No antivenom has been developed against <em>L. achelous</em>. Clinical experience supports treatment with antifibrinolytic therapy with aprotinin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminocaproic acid</a>, while blood replacement products (cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, whole blood) may cause worsening of symptoms and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2967998831\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoidance of areas with heavy infestation of caterpillars or moths known to cause hypersensitivity reactions may decrease risk for lepidopterism. If contact cannot be avoided for occupational or other reasons, gloves and appropriate clothing to minimize skin exposure can be worn. Clothing that may have come in contact with Lepidoptera or setae should be promptly removed after exposure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345911613\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;lepidopterism&quot; describes a group of reactions that occur secondary to contact with caterpillars, moths, or butterflies. The major types of reactions include sting reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and lonomism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112412\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112412 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3807411424\" class=\"local\">'Types of reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sting reactions can occur from contact with caterpillars bearing spines. Caterpillars of three families of moths are primarily responsible for sting reactions, Hemileucinae (silk moths), Limacodidae (slug moths), and Megalopygidae (flannel moths). Sting reactions typically cause pain that persists for hours. Occasionally, pain is severe. (See <a href=\"#H4018860321\" class=\"local\">'Sting reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypersensitivity reactions usually occur in response to contact with caterpillars or moths that bear numerous hair-like setae. Reactions may also occur from contact with dislodged setae in the environment. Patients typically present with itchy papules, urticarial wheals, or a pruritic dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F112315%7EDERM%2F112316%7EDERM%2F112317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112315 graphicRef112316 graphicRef112317 \">picture 8A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3727160234\" class=\"local\">'Hypersensitivity reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stings from <em>Lonomia achelous</em> and <em>Lonomia obliqua</em> caterpillars can result in lonomism, a potentially fatal disorder. Patients typically develop severe pain at the site of envenomation, followed by dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A hemorrhagic diathesis and renal failure can occur. (See <a href=\"#H947971738\" class=\"local\">'Lonomism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with lepidopterism do not require aggressive treatment. Visible spines and setae embedded in the skin should be removed. Analgesics can help relieve pain from stings. Oral antihistamines, topical antipruritic agents, and topical corticosteroids may help relieve pruritus associated with hypersensitivity reactions. (See <a href=\"#H3332399190\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lonomism usually require inpatient supportive care and prompt medical intervention. We suggest treatment of <em>L. obliqua</em> envenomation with antilonomic serum (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with <em>L. achelous</em> stings may benefit from treatment with antifibrinolytics.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lepidopterism-skin-disorders-secondary-to-caterpillars-and-moths/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
