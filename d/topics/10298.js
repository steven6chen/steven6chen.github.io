They can occur in several different anatomic portions of the atrial septum, and the location of the defect generally reflects the abnormality of embryogenesis that led to the anomaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52106 \">figure 1</a>). An atrial septal defect (ASD) can be isolated or can be associated with other congenital cardiac abnormalities. The sizes of ASDs are variable, and their functional consequences are related to the anatomic location of the defect, its size, the presence or absence of other cardiac anomalies, as well as systolic and diastolic function of the ventricles.</p><p>The management and outcomes of children with an isolated ASD will be reviewed here. The classification of ASDs, and the pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of isolated ASD in children are discussed separately.

Thus, in the absence of associated symptoms, early closure is not indicated for these defects. Defects of moderate (between 6 and 8 mm in diameter) and large (&gt;8 mm in diameter) secundum defects, and other forms of ASDs, are unlikely to close spontaneously. However, closure of even moderate and large isolated secundum ASDs is not recommended in asymptomatic patients before two years of age due to the possibility, however small, of spontaneous closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H18283612\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Spontaneous closure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535639991\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The given size of a defect is related to overall heart size, so that an ASD that is 6 mm in diameter would be insignificant in an adult, but would be of moderate size in a newborn. Nevertheless, for patients with a small ASD (&lt;6 mm in diameter), no large randomized trials have demonstrated a benefit of closure of small ASDs in asymptomatic patients. Without the justification of such data, we do not advocate closure of such defects in the general population in the absence of symptoms. The risk of paradoxical embolism through a small ASD or valve-competent patent foramen ovale is uncertain. The benefit of ASD closure in reducing the risk of embolism must be weighed against the short and long-term risks of the procedure for closure. These procedure risks are changing as closure techniques continue to improve with decreasing morbidity. Closure is recommended by many clinicians in older patients with a small ASD who have experienced embolic strokes or transient ischemic attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of patent foramen ovale (PFO) for secondary stroke prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with a persistent moderate or larger defect, left-to-right shunting usually increases with age if the defect is not corrected. In these patients, closure is recommended for patients who exhibit significant shunting, as discussed below. However, the indications for closure of asymptomatic ASDs that are not associated with right heart enlargement and do not have significant shunting are less clear. Evolving experience with percutaneous ASD closure may make a subset of such patients suitable candidates for closure. Since an increase in shunt volume can occur with moderate-sized ASDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], periodic follow-up of patients with such defects is clearly indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H18283618\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Persistent moderate to large ASDs'</a> and <a href=\"#H535641199\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116887621\"><span class=\"h3\">Size of the shunt and right ventricular load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main indication for ASD closure has been the presence of a shunt, which results in significant right heart overload. This typically occurs in patients with moderate to large ASDs. Although strong evidence is lacking, the general clinical standard for repair is a measured shunt with a ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow <span class=\"nowrap\">(Qp/Qs)</span> &gt;2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but other experts in the field have advocated lower thresholds of 1.7:1 and 1.5:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Although cardiac catheterization has been considered the gold standard for <span class=\"nowrap\">Qp/Qs</span> measurement, noninvasive phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in experienced hands appears to be at least as good as the standard Fick technique for measuring shunt flow with blood samples obtained at catheterization. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography is now routinely used in sites that have established an acceptable correlation between echocardiographic and catheterization laboratory or magnetic resonance estimates of shunt flow. Because echocardiography and MRI are noninvasive, these techniques easily permit serial monitoring. The technical aspects of measuring <span class=\"nowrap\">Qp/Qs</span> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and assessment of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;, section on 'Estimation of the Qp/Qs'</a>.)</p><p>If quantitative measures of shunt fraction are not available, echocardiographic evidence of substantial right heart enlargement, and qualitative color and spectral Doppler findings of a large amount of left-to-right shunting through the atrial septal defect can be sufficient to justify atrial septal defect closure. Findings that support ASD closure, but are not sufficient in isolation, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ausculatory finding of a tricuspid flow rumble by an experienced clinician</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased heart size and pulmonary vascularity on chest roentgenogram</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535640164\"><span class=\"h1\">CLOSURE PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Closure of an isolated secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) can be achieved by either a surgical or percutaneous transcatheter approach.</p><p>Prior to closure, a comprehensive noninvasive echocardiograph examination is essential to determine the size of the defect, exclude pulmonary hypertension, and detect any other cardiac anatomic defects such as anomalous pulmonary venous connections. Data from this study may help inform the choice of intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>Sinus venosus defects, coronary sinus defects, primum ASDs, and complex congenital lesions including partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection require surgical correction. In addition, infants with large secundum defects who present with heart failure may also need to undergo surgical correction. The decision on whether or not to refer a patient with symptomatic secundum atrial septal defect to catheter device closure or surgery is individualized based on specific defect anatomy and institutional expertise. Transcatheter secundum ASD closure can be highly successful in infants and small children, but appears to have higher complication rates than transcatheter closure of ASDs in older children in the four- to five-year age range, when elective closure is typically performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, ASD closure is not indicated in older patients with fixed severe pulmonary hypertension.

The traditional surgical approach for ASD repair has been through a median sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In some centers, surgeons are now employing minimally invasive approaches that substantially reduce incision size. However, these approaches are not necessarily appropriate for all ASDs. The applicability of a minimally invasive surgical approach will depend on specific patient ASD anatomy and institutional surgical expertise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-percutaneous-closure-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults#H336927359\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;, section on 'Minimally invasive surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical closure is usually performed using a pericardial or Dacron patch. Small defects are often closed by direct suturing. However, suture closure of large defects can lead to distortion of the atrium. Repair of sinus venosus defects requires placement of a patch to direct the right pulmonary venous return into the left atrium, and the systemic venous return into the right atrium.</p><p>Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can assess the adequacy of repair and detect residual flow across the surgical site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54350\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef54350 \">movie 1</a>).

Long-term morbidities such as stroke, heart failure, heart block, and pulmonary hypertension are also rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one study, symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 6 percent of patients at 15 years after surgery, and in an additional 2 percent in the next decade, a lower rate than in patients with untreated ASDs or after surgical correction in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In December 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health approved the Amplatzer Septal Occluder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52160\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52160 \">figure 2</a>) and the Cardio-Seal Septal Occlusion System for percutaneous closure of secundum ASDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In 2007, the FDA also approved the HELEX Septal Occluder for percutaneous closure of secundum ASDs; however, this device is not suitable for defects greater than 18 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

As a result, this approach has largely replaced surgery in some centers for the closure of small to moderate secundum ASDs that have appropriate anatomic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The applicability of percutaneous closure in an individual patient is highly dependent on specific secundum ASD anatomy and institutional expertise. Larger secundum defects are generally closed surgically, although defects over 30 mm have been successfully closed by the catheter technique. Percutaneous closure also requires an adequate rim of tissue around the defect to prevent obstruction of the coronary sinus, right pulmonary veins, vena cavae, or atrioventricular valves. The insertion of more than one device to close multiple ASDs is safe and effective if the patient is large enough (ideally &gt;20 kg), and the distance between the defects is adequate (at least 7 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Measurement of the size and location of the ASD by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can help select the appropriate device. In addition, TEE can be used to guide the procedure in real time, an approach that may minimize fluoroscopy time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Two- or even three-dimensional TEE is particularly helpful when multiple devices are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The development of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) has provided a modality for evaluating cardiac anatomy that may be particularly well-suited for use in the management of ASDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. ICE can provide guidance for device placement and facilitates proper device selection by providing an accurate assessment of the size and shape (typically elliptical) of the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>ICE has the following advantages compared with TEE: it does not require endotracheal intubation or general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>], it permits continuous monitoring during the procedure, and it may shorten the duration of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110819865\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periprocedural complications associated with transcatheter closure of an ASD include device embolization or malposition, and arrhythmias (usually atrial but can include sudden death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. This was illustrated by a review of 417 children and adults (mean age 27 &plusmn; 19 years) who underwent secundum ASD closure with the Amplatzer or Cardio-Seal device that reported a complication rate of 8.6 percent of patients (n = 34) during hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ten patients underwent elective surgical repair because of device malposition (three patients) or device embolization (seven patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining 24 patients had minor complications that included unsatisfactory device position or embolization that was managed percutaneously, arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, thrombus formation on the left atrial disc, right iliac vein dissection, groin hematoma, hemorrhage in the retropharynx, and sizing balloon rupture.</p><p/><p>Cardiac perforation, which can present as hemopericardium, pericardial effusion, cardiovascular collapse, or sudden death, is an uncommon complication of the Amplatzer septal occluder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Many secundum atrial septal defects or incompetent foramen ovales identified on echocardiograms obtained for nonspecific indications in early infancy will close spontaneously during later infancy or early childhood. The monitoring of these patients, as well as those patients with defects other than secundum who are diagnosed prenatally, is dependent on the size and type of their defect.

Openings with a tissue flap are defined as PFO, and those without a tissue flap are defined as secundum ASD. The absence of a tissue flap is usually associated with a &quot;T artifact&quot;, a hyperintense blunted edge at the margin of the defect in the atrial septum on echocardiography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other cardiologists use defect size or position in the atrial septum to differentiate between atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale. Caution should be employed when using absolute defect diameter for classification in premature infants, because the physiologic effect of defect size obviously varies with patient size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the lack of uniformity in subjective interpretations of echocardiograms, and because pediatric cardiology practice standards differ, primary care clinicians should seek pediatric cardiology advice regarding the necessity for follow-up when receiving an echocardiographic report identifying an ASD or a borderline classification such as <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;PFO/ASD&quot;</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the present time, there is no evidence that medical follow-up of asymptomatic patients with PFO has any benefit. Because of the high prevalence of PFO, medical follow-up of all PFOs would necessarily be burdensome on a population basis. Thus, if a defect is characterized as &quot;PFO&quot; on the echocardiographic report, follow-up should, in general, not be necessary. Many PFOs will spontaneously close during childhood and adolescence, and most of the PFOs that persist into adulthood never cause problems. We do not recommend causing anxiety in the parents of infants and young children regarding the relatively unusual pathologic manifestations associated with PFO, such as paradoxical embolus and decompression illness, which are typically seen much later in adulthood, and which are statistically unlikely to occur in any individual young pediatric patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is possible that future longitudinal population studies will reveal follow-up to be worthwhile in certain specific anatomical subtypes of PFO, such as those associated with a substantial aneurysm of the septum primum or a large Eustachian valve. However, definitive information in this regard is not yet available because of selection bias of the extant reports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child in whom a clinically significant ASD is detected should be followed by a pediatric cardiologist on an annual or biannual basis. Clinically significant atrial septal defects include all ASDs of 3 mm maximal diameter or greater in size, since experience has shown that secundum ASDs of 3 mm or larger can substantially increase in size with patient growth. The history and physical examination during follow-up evaluations should be focused on detecting any development of signs or symptoms of increased shunting. Indications of possibly increased shunting include failure to gain weight appropriately, having increased respiratory infections, and rarely, signs of heart failure such as hepatomegaly or auscultatory evidence of pulmonary congestion. Echocardiography is indicated when there is concern that the shunt may be increasing, or to confirm spontaneous closure. (See <a href=\"#H535639991\" class=\"local\">'Persistent defect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535641286\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria and timing for closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, closure is recommended for children who have right heart enlargement, pulmonary overcirculation, and evidence of substantial left-to-right shunting through an atrial septal defect. Although strong evidence is lacking, the general clinical standard for repair is a measured shunt with a ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow <span class=\"nowrap\">(Qp/Qs)</span> &gt;2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but other experts in the field have advocated lower thresholds of 1.7:1 and 1.5:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-isolated-atrial-septal-defects-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. If quantitative measures of shunt fraction are not available, echocardiographic evidence of substantial right heart enlargement, and qualitative color and spectral Doppler findings of a large amount of left-to-right shunting through the atrial septal defect can be sufficient to justify atrial septal defect closure. As noted above, we consider supporting clinical evidence for ASD closure including presence of right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram, auscultatory findings of a tricuspid flow rumble by experienced physical examiners, and increased heart size with increased pulmonary vascularity on chest roentgenogram.</p><p>For patients with a persistent ASD without a significant left-to-right shunt or symptoms directly attributable to the ASD, such as paradoxical embolism or platypnea-orthodeoxia (shortness of breath and hypoxemia when sitting or standing, which is relieved when lying down), there is <strong>no </strong>definitive evidence that ASD closure is beneficial. Most pathologic consequences of ASD, such as atrial arrhythmias and (rarely) pulmonary hypertension, are secondary to right heart volume overload or pulmonary overcirculation. No studies have shown that prospective closure of asymptomatic small atrial septal defects prevents paradoxical embolization, and the risk of endocarditis with isolated small ASDs appears to be negligible. Since all closure techniques have risk, closure of asymptomatic small ASDs does not appear to be warranted at this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535641357\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of intervention is dependent on the type of the ASD and if there are any other cardiac defects. Prior to selecting an intervention, a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation is performed to determine if there are any factors that help in determining the optimal choice of intervention. For example, although rare in children with ASDs, severe fixed pulmonary hypertension is a contraindication for surgical repair, and in these patients percutaneous closure may be more appropriate.</p><p>Percutaneous closure is only applicable to isolated secundum ASDs, and should not be used in patients with sinus venosus, primum or coronary sinus ASD, or in infants with large defects and heart failure. In our practice, we prefer percutaneous closure for patients with secundum ASDs with defects that are less than 30 mm in diameter and have a rim of tissue around the defect for effective closure without obstruction or impingement on adjacent cardiac structures. Although successful percutaneous closure can be performed in young infants, the complication rate appears to be higher in infants and young children, compared with older patients in the three- to five-year age range who weigh at least 15 kg. Furthermore, spontaneous closure of even large ASDs can occur in infants and young children. As a result, the benefits of closure in infants and young children (weight &lt;15 kg) must be weighed against the increased risk of complication and possibility of spontaneous closure. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous closure'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgical closure is reserved for all other patients or based on family preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535641439\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-procedure care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical evaluation subsequent to closure should assess for signs of embolic events, arrhythmia, and chest pain. Echocardiographic surveillance is essential to detect complications including residual shunting, pericardial effusion, ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressure, and in patients who underwent percutaneous device closure, device migration and thrombosis. Electrocardiographic monitoring is also performed to detect any evidence of atrial arrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309396044\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-percutaneous closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are typically treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clopidogrel</a>, or other anticoagulant agent subsequent to percutaneous ASD defect closure for six months to reduce the chance of thrombus formation on the ASD device before the device has become endothelialized.</p><p>In addition, temporary limitations on highly vigorous physical activity during the weeks immediately subsequent to ASD device implantation are usually advised. Specific recommendations on such temporary exercise limitations vary among interventional cardiologists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309396051\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-surgical closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the immediate postoperative period, pericardial, pleural effusions and postpericardiotomy syndrome can occur subsequent to surgical ASD repair.
