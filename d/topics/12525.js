The widespread use of effective ART starting in the mid-1990s has led to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of opportunistic infections as illustrated in the studies below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study of 2410 patients in Switzerland from 1995 to 1997, the incidence of any OI decreased from 15.1 per 100 person-years in the six months before initiating ART to 7.7 and 2.6 per 100 person-years in the first three and six months after starting ART, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Vaccine efficacy may be compromised in advanced disease; thus, some providers may choose to wait on certain immunizations until ART has been started and some degree of immune recovery has occurred. A detailed discussion of immunizations in HIV-infected patients is found elsewhere.

Such patients are usually those who are not receiving ART (eg, those unaware of their diagnosis, have recently started therapy, or who are prescribed ART but are not adherent to their treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These additional strategies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoiding Exposure</strong> &minus; For certain pathogens, patients can prevent infection by avoiding exposure. As an example, patients without evidence of prior exposure to <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> should avoid contact with cat feces (eg, changing litter) or eating undercooked meat. The risk of infection with other pathogens can also be reduced by appropriate precautions; such pathogens include <em>Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, <em>Cystoisospora,</em> Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster virus, and <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>.

When to initiate such therapy depends upon the CD4 count. (See <a href=\"#H458951808\" class=\"local\">'When to administer antimicrobial therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Antimicrobials are not generally recommended to prevent active infection with pathogens such as <em>Bartonella </em>spp<em>, Candida </em>spp<em>, Cryptosporidium</em>, or Cytomegalovirus, for one or more of the following reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Such pathogens are associated with a low incidence of disease. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are concerns that antimicrobial therapy can result in the development of drug-resistance. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antimicrobials can result in significant side effects and drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Instead, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of disease. (See <a href=\"#H355289189\" class=\"local\">'Early Detection'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In selected rare patients (eg, those with highly chaotic psychosocial situations) who are at extremely high risk for poor adherence, we may elect to prescribe only ART at first, and not risk distracting the patient with agents for OI prevention. Since ART is the most effective intervention to prevent OIs, clinicians should prioritize HIV ART. If preventive therapy is still needed once they start ART, it can still be initiated at a later time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458951808\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO ADMINISTER ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer antimicrobial therapy to certain HIV-infected patients with the goal of preventing a clinically significant opportunistic infection (OI). Such treatment is typically initiated as the individual&rsquo;s cell-mediated immunity (ie, CD4 cell count) declines. </p><p>Antimicrobial therapy can be used in several settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent infection in uninfected individuals (eg, primary prophylaxis for <em>P. jirovecii)</em>.

However, for certain patients with a CD4 count &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> especially those in resource-limited settings, screening for serum cryptococcal antigen and preemptive therapy for those who test positive may be useful to prevent symptomatic infection. The use of preemptive therapy is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Although MAC prophylaxis with a macrolide had been common practice for all patients with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> prior to the introduction of effective ART, our approach has changed since the risk of MAC infection is low in the setting of ART, the outcome of MAC disease does not differ among those who did or did not receive prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], and there are no clinical trial data on MAC prophylaxis in the era of effective ART. Furthermore, some patients may have asymptomatic infection with MAC that becomes evident after starting ART due to an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. In this setting, if single-drug therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> was used for prophylaxis, it might select for macrolide drug resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients#H3809570969\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Treatment failure'</a>.)</p><p>However, on rare occasion, there may be a temporary delay in initiating ART among those with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (eg, patient refusal). Unless there are concerns that the patient may have active MAC infection (eg, fevers, weight loss), MAC prophylaxis should be initiated and continued until ART is started. If there is concern for active infection, a mycobacterial blood culture should first be obtained, and prophylaxis should be delayed for 7 to 10 days, pending the results. A more detailed discussion of MAC prophylaxis is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients#H26535598\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Prevention of MAC disease'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355289189\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY DETECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> screened for evidence of disease, especially if severely immunocompromised. As an example, we do not administer suppressive therapy to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection to those who are seropositive because of cost, risk of resistance, and lack of proven survival benefit. Such patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of CMV disease, such as CMV retinitis (eg, increased floaters, decreased visual acuity). In addition, some experts recommend yearly ophthalmologic exams for all patients with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> to identify CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other infections that have ocular manifestations. However, this screening strategy for asymptomatic patients is typically not needed since most patients who start antiretroviral therapy (ART) will have prompt recovery of their CD4 cell count to &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.
