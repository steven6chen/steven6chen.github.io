Management of these patients demands a rapid multidisciplinary approach, including anesthesiology, medicine, obstetrics, neonatology, and sometimes cardiothoracic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Basic and advanced cardiac life support algorithms should be implemented; however, the physiological and anatomical changes of pregnancy require some modifications to these protocols. Randomized trials of approaches to management of pregnant women with cardiopulmonary arrest are lacking; therefore, recommendations for these modifications are based on data from small case series and small cohort studies involving patients with cardiac arrest during cesarean delivery, and expert opinion.</p><p>This topic will focus on management of cardiopulmonary arrest during pregnancy.

In the United States, data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) indicated that cardiac arrest complicated approximately 1 in 12,000 hospitalizations for delivery between 1998 and 2011, and the frequency remained stable over the interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Data for Canada between 2002 and 2015 was similar, cardiac arrest occurred in 1 in 12,500 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9057205\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac arrest may be related to conditions unique to pregnancy or etiologies found in the nongravid state (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70707 \">table 1</a>).

In pregnant women, delivery early in the resuscitation process is a key intervention for improving success rates. (Perimortem cesarean delivery can be defined as a cesarean delivery after cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]).

In pregnant women with uterine fundal height at or above the umbilicus, the uterus should be displaced to the patient&rsquo;s left during resuscitation to minimize aortocaval compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9057219\" class=\"local\">'Avoiding aortocaval compression'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178440987\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active airway management is the initial consideration. Key points are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygenate well with 100 percent oxygen by face mask to avoid desaturation (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid nonphysiologic respiratory alkalosis (normal pregnancy is associated with mild respiratory alkalosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilation volumes may need to be lower than in nonpregnant women if the uterus is very large</p><p/><p>Pregnant women are at increased risk of rapidly developing hypoxemia because of decreased functional residual capacity and increased oxygen consumption, as well as increased intrapulmonary shunting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Both intubation and bag mask ventilation can be more difficult in the late stages of pregnancy and back-up airway procedures, including cricothyrotomy, may be required in some cases. During pregnancy, the elevated diaphragm may result in the need for lower ventilation volumes and increased resistance to ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management of the pregnant patient at delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The increased risk of aspiration and narrowing of upper airways, particularly in the third trimester, require special consideration during pregnancy. Bag-mask ventilation with 100 percent oxygen (two-handed, &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min)</span> and suctioning of the airway are critical to perform before intubation in a pregnant woman. Intubation via direct or video laryngoscopy and 100 percent oxygen is performed using a smaller-sized endotracheal tube (0.5 mm to 1.0 mm less in internal diameter compared to that used for nonpregnant women). Endotracheal tube placement should be verified using capnography. Cricoid pressure during laryngoscopy, once universally recommended, is now controversial because of lack of evidence of benefit and its ability to make both intubation and placement of a supraglottic airway more difficult. If used, pressure must be applied correctly over the cricoid cartilage, and the operator should discontinue it in cases where laryngoscopic view of the glottis is inadequate (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>). Supraglottic airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway should be considered if unable to intubate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. No more than two attempts with either direct laryngoscopy or videolaryngoscopy before insertion of a supraglottic device are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Hyperventilation has adverse effects and should be avoided in any patient undergoing resuscitation. In pregnancy, maternal alkalosis can cause uterine vasoconstriction, which can lead to fetal hypoxia and acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H4318336\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway management while performing ACLS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178440993\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest compressions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-quality chest compressions are the cornerstone of the resuscitation process. The 2015 American Heart Association guideline on cardiac arrest in pregnancy&nbsp;recommends the same hand position for and performance of chest compressions in pregnant women and nonpregnant adults because of an absence of data supporting a different approach in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Previous guidelines suggested a more cephalad hand position in pregnancy to adjust for elevation of the diaphragm by the gravid uterus: However, an imaging study showed no significant vertical displacement of the heart in the third trimester of pregnancy relative to the nonpregnant state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Performance of excellent chest compressions'</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178440999\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous access should be established above the femoral region since drugs administered via the femoral vein may not reach the maternal heart until the fetus is delivered. Access to an antecubital vein with two 14-gauge catheters can be as effective as central line catheters for volume replacement, but do not allow hemodynamic monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the absence of intravenous access, rapid intraosseous access can be achieved in a few seconds using commercially available kits. If neither intravenous nor intraosseous access is possible, the endotracheal tube can be used to administer certain medications including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.

A hand is used to apply maximal leftward push to the right upper border of the uterus to achieve displacement of about 1.5 inches from the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Left lateral uterine displacement is necessary in the pregnant patient with fundal height at, or above, the umbilicus, to minimize aortocaval compression (supine hypotensive syndrome), optimize venous return (preload), and generate adequate stroke volume during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Our preference for manual uterine displacement is based on a randomized trial that compared manual uterine displacement versus operating room table tilt during cesarean delivery and demonstrated significantly fewer episodes of hypotension and a lower <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> requirement in the manual displacement group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, manual displacement of the uterus allows the patient&rsquo;s upper torso to remain supine, which enables application of maximum resuscitative force for effective chest compressions, improves airway and intravenous access, and improves access for defibrillation.</p><p>Other methods to achieve left lateral uterine displacement include: tilt of the operating room table or placement of pillows, a wood or foam resuscitation wedge (eg, Cardiff wedge), or rolled up towels or blankets under the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If a suitable wedge is not available, the patient can be tilted upon a rescuer (the rescuer sits on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> heels and uses <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> thighs as a wedge under the patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. If the patient is tilted, an angle of no more than 30 degrees is probably optimal. A study that used a calibrated force transducer to assess the maximum chest compression force generated at various angles of inclination in late pregnancy found that maximum resuscitative force (expressed as percent body weight) decreased from 67 percent in the supine position to 36 percent in the full lateral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Optimal compressive force was achieved at an angle of 27 degrees and was 57 percent (80 percent of the force generated in the supine position).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271109417\"><span class=\"h2\">Defibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of ventricular arrhythmias may require defibrillation during maternal resuscitation. The physiological changes of pregnancy, including increases in blood volume and decreases in functional residual capacity, do not appear to alter transthoracic impedance or transmyocardial current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Therefore, current energy requirements for adult defibrillation are appropriate for use in pregnant women (biphasic shock 120 to 200 Joules with subsequent increase in energy output if the first shock is ineffective) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Before delivering the countershock, remove fetal monitoring equipment to prevent electrocution injury to the patient or rescuers. This risk is theoretical and of greatest concern when the fetus has scalp electrodes.

If the prenatal record or a corroborating family member is not available, physical examination can aid in establishing the gestational age. Uterine size correlates with gestational age, but can be misleading in some situations, such as when there is a multiple gestation, large fibroids, severe oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, or maternal obesity. The formula for estimating gestational age by physical examination is: distance from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus (cm) = gestational age (weeks). The top of the uterine fundus is generally at the level of the umbilicus by 20 weeks of gestation in a singleton pregnancy. Ultrasound is a reliable method for gestational age assessment, but may not be possible due to time and logistical constraints during maternal assessment and resuscitation.

Therefore, fetal monitoring is not recommended during the resuscitation process. If CPR is successful and the mother becomes hemodynamically stable, fetal monitors can be applied to assess the status of the fetus that is at a potentially viable gestational age. Intervention (in utero resuscitation measures, delivery) for nonreassuring fetal status depends on maternal- and fetal-specific factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9057240\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery as part of the resuscitation process</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Heart Association and others recommend cesarean delivery if spontaneous circulation has not returned within four minutes of maternal cardiorespiratory collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27,28</a>]. Ideally, perimortem cesarean should be initiated within four minutes and delivery of the newborn should be completed within five minutes (known as the &ldquo;four-minute rule&rdquo; or &ldquo;the five-minute rule&rdquo;). Perimortem instrumental vaginal delivery is appropriate if it can be achieved within this timeframe. To achieve this timeframe, delivery needs to be performed at the location of the arrest, which is often not an operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/3,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29</a>].</p><p>The rationale for this approach is based on case reports, small case series, and experimental data showing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/15,30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30-36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irreversible brain damage can occur in nonpregnant individuals after four to six minutes of anoxia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women become anoxic sooner than nonpregnant women because of decreased functional residual capacity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the uterine fundus is at or above the umbilicus, ineffective resuscitation efforts may become effective when the uterus is no longer gravid and potentially causing aortocaval compression.

Blood flow during CPR is produced by mechanical compression of the heart between the sternum and the spine and phasic fluctuations in intrathoracic pressure. Despite appropriate use of leftward uterine displacement, the mechanical effects of the gravid uterus can decrease venous return from the inferior vena cava, obstruct blood flow through the abdominal aorta, and diminish thoracic compliance, all of which contribute to unsuccessful CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Without restoration of cardiac output, both mother and fetus are at risk for hypoxia and eventually anoxia, especially when interruption of normal cardiac and respiratory function persists beyond four minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although it may be counterintuitive to operate on a hemodynamically unstable patient, cesarean delivery may be life-saving for both mother and fetus in this situation. Delivery of the baby empties the uterus, relieving the aortocaval compression. This results in a 60 to 80 percent increase in cardiac output, thereby increasing the likelihood of maternal survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2349341435\"><span class=\"h3\">Evidence for the five-minute rule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there have been no controlled clinical trials in this area, a review of case reports of perimortem cesarean delivery from 1900 to 1985 suggested that normal neonatal neurological outcome was most likely when delivery was completed within five minutes of maternal cardiac arrest. In this series, 42 of 42 infants delivered within five minutes had a normal neurological outcome compared with seven of eight infants delivered within 6 to 10 minutes, six of seven infants delivered within 11 to 15 minutes, 0 of 1 infant delivered between 16 and 20 minutes, and one of three infants delivered within 21 to 25 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The authors&rsquo; subsequent evaluation of perimortem cesarean cases reported from 1985 to 2004 noted perimortem cesarean was associated with spontaneous return of maternal circulation or improvement in maternal hemodynamic status in 12 of 20 cases, particularly when the delivery was completed within five minutes of maternal arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No case of perimortem cesarean delivery resulted in deterioration of the maternal condition, although these case reports are highly subject to reporting bias. Similarly, neonatal outcomes were best when delivery was completed within five minutes; 9 of 12 infants delivered within this timeframe had a normal neurological outcome (neonatal outcome was not reported for three infants); two of six infants born from 6 to 15 minutes after maternal cardiac arrest had normal outcomes (one infant outcome was not reported), and four of seven infants delivered after 15 minutes of maternal arrest had normal outcomes. Additional features favoring infant survival include absence of sustained pre-arrest maternal hypoxia, minimal or no signs of fetal distress before maternal cardiac arrest, aggressive and effective resuscitative efforts for the mother, and neonatal intensive care unit on site of the emergency cesarean delivery.</p><p>Practically, the goal of delivering the infant within five minutes has been difficult to achieve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-arrest-in-pregnancy/abstract/4,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,44</a>].

This may be due to differences between the two groups in clinical risk factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differences in intensity of patient monitoring among various hospital units.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9057268\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The A through H mnemonic is useful as a reminder of the causes of cardiac arrest in pregnant women (see <a href=\"#H9057205\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A: Anesthetic complications, <span class=\"nowrap\">Accident/trauma</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B: Bleeding </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>C: Cardiac </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>D: Drugs </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>E: Embolic causes </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>F: Fever </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>G: General including hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>H: Hypertension </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key principles for resuscitation of pregnant women are (see <a href=\"#H9057212\" class=\"local\">'Key principles for resuscitation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Call a maternal code blue, which should include a multi-disciplinary team.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the uterus is above the umbilicus, displace it off aortocaval vessels. We suggest manually displacing the uterus laterally to the patient's left rather than tilting the entire patient (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A hand is used to apply maximal leftward push to the right upper border of the uterus to achieve displacement of about 1.5 inches from the midline. Leave the upper torso supine. (See <a href=\"#H9057219\" class=\"local\">'Avoiding aortocaval compression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assume a difficult airway. Bag-mask ventilation with 100 percent oxygen and suctioning of the airway are critical before intubation in a pregnant woman. Oxygenate well to avoid desaturation and avoid respiratory alkalosis; ventilation volumes may need to be lower than in nonpregnant women if the uterus is very large. (See <a href=\"#H178440987\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place hands for chest compression at the same location and perform compressions in the same way as in nonpregnant adults. (See <a href=\"#H178440993\" class=\"local\">'Chest compressions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not delay usual measures such as defibrillation and the administration of medications. Energy requirements for adult defibrillation are the same as in nonpregnant women. All medications at the same doses for treatment of cardiopulmonary arrest in the nonpregnant patient are used for the pregnant patient. (See <a href=\"#H2271109417\" class=\"local\">'Defibrillation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9057254\" class=\"local\">'Use of medications for CPR during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Designate a dedicated timer to notify the resuscitation team when four minutes have elapsed after the onset of a maternal cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"#H9057240\" class=\"local\">'Delivery as part of the resuscitation process'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is no return of spontaneous circulation with the usual resuscitation measures and the uterine fundus is at or beyond the umbilicus, we agree with AHA guidelines that recommend beginning perimortem cesarean (resuscitative hysterotomy) at four minutes and completing delivery of the newborn by five minutes following cardiac arrest (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In pregnant women, delivery early in the resuscitation process is a key intervention for improving success rates. Assisted vaginal delivery is appropriate if the neonate can be delivered within five minutes of maternal cardiorespiratory collapse. (See <a href=\"#H9057240\" class=\"local\">'Delivery as part of the resuscitation process'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perform delivery at the site of resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H9057247\" class=\"local\">'Delivery issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-arrest, induction of mild to moderate hypothermia (target temperature 32 to 34 degrees Celsius for 24 hours) is reasonable in women who are comatose or not following commands or showing purposeful movements following resuscitation. It is not used routinely because in undelivered patients it may not be safe for the fetus, and in postpartum patients it may impair coagulation and contribute to bleeding complications. (See <a href=\"#H13922186\" class=\"local\">'Postarrest care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac arrest in pregnant women is associated with high maternal and neonatal fatality rates. Survival of the mother and neonate depend on several factors, including the underlying etiology for the arrest, maternal location at the time of the arrest (out-of-hospital versus in-hospital), speed of resuscitative efforts, and the skills and resources of the healthcare providers.
