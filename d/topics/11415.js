A large international outbreak of fusarial keratitis between 2004 and 2006 was linked to use of a specific contact lens solution (ReNu with MoistureLoc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. The solution was not intrinsically contaminated. One study has suggested that in the setting of storage at high temperatures, the antimicrobial agent in the solution, alexidine dihydrochloride, permeates the walls of the plastic bottle, resulting in decreased concentrations in the solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The fungicidal action of the solution was diminished, allowing <em>Fusarium</em> that had been introduced by the wearer while caring for his or her lenses to grow and contaminate the contact lens and the lens case. The solution was recalled in the United States in 2006, and rates of contact lens&ndash;associated <em>Fusarium</em> keratitis have declined since then [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The incidence of fungal keratitis caused by <em>Fusarium</em> species is highly variable and depends largely upon the geographic location.

These variable rates are probably related to climate characteristics, with tropical and subtropical areas exhibiting the highest rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420413570\"><span class=\"h3\">Onychomycosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Fusarium</em> species have been reported as agents of onychomycosis with increasing frequency among immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>] with variable rates reported from different regions.

The principal modes of infection are airborne or via direct inoculation at various sites (skin and others) of <em>Fusarium</em>-contaminated material, including water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57202 \">table 2</a>). Airborne infection results from the inhalation of fusarial conidia that in some cases have been associated with aerosolization of conidia from a water source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, preexisting skin breakdown or onychomycosis may facilitate direct introduction of <em>Fusarium</em> spp. An increase in cases of invasive fusariosis with a cutaneous portal of entry has been reported in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Onychomycosis and intertrigo were the predominant primary lesions. A subsequent study from the same group showed that in hematologic patients at high risk of developing invasive fusariosis, the presence of such lesions growing <em>Fusarium</em> spp at the time of admission increased the risk for the subsequent occurrence of invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H524570275\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with compromised immune function are at increased risk for invasive fusariosis, particularly in the setting of prolonged and profound neutropenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe T cell immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

However, in a multicenter study conducted between 2007 and 2009 in Brazil, invasive fusariosis was the second most common cause of invasive fungal disease among patients with AML (3.8 percent) and the most common cause among allogeneic HCT recipients (5.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Smoking also appears to be a risk factor in patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Invasive fusariosis also occurs with an increased frequency among allogeneic HCT recipients in whom a trimodal distribution of infection has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The first peak occurs during the first 30 days following transplantation and is associated with neutropenia. Severe T cell immunodeficiency (but not neutropenia) is the major risk factor for fusariosis that develops after engraftment and which occurs at a median of 70 days after HCT, commonly in the setting of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and therapy with glucocorticoids. The third peak is observed &gt;1 year after HCT during treatment for extensive chronic GVHD. In one study, risk factors for invasive fusariosis during the early phase following allogeneic HCT included receipt of antithymocyte globulin, hyperglycemia, and AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-fusarium-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].
