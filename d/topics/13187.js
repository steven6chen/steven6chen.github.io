The optimal position may require a compromise between the best position for surgical access and the position the patient can tolerate. The chosen position may result in physiologic changes and can result in soft tissue injury (eg, nerve damage, pressure-induced injury or ulceration, or compartment syndrome).</p><p>This topic will discuss the basic principles for positioning and specific concerns for a variety of positions. Postoperative visual loss, which may be related to patient positioning, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-visual-loss-after-anesthesia-for-nonocular-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative visual loss after anesthesia for nonocular surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3391373196\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3032668888\"><span class=\"h2\">Trial positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When possible, the position during surgery should be one that would be comfortable with the patient fully awake. Patients should be questioned about limited range of motion and their ability to lie comfortably in the expected position. If questions arise, the patient should be placed in the anticipated position as a trial before sedation or induction of anesthesia.</p><p>If the operating table will be tilted either top to bottom, side to side, or moved into the sitting position (eg, during breast reconstruction) during surgery, the anticipated position should be practiced before skin preparation and draping, to make sure supports and straps are secure and that the patient tolerates the position physiologically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3348886797\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All positions used for surgery can cause cardiovascular and pulmonary changes. Both general and neuraxial anesthesia can affect the normal compensatory mechanisms that maintain cardiovascular stability and can cause changes in ventilation and perfusion that can result in hypoxemia. In addition, compression of tissue or vascular structures related to positioning can cause regional ischemia. The physiologic effects of specific positions are discussed individually. (See <a href=\"#H2738577481\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of supine position'</a> below and <a href=\"#H402644297\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of Trendelenburg positioning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2535301564\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of reverse Trendelenburg position'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1264650924\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of lithotomy positioning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1657721279\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of lateral decubitus positioning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H155734263\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of prone positioning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H400335488\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of sitting position'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2466152097\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative peripheral nerve injury can result in temporary or permanent sensory or motor deficits, paresthesias, or pain, and in some cases, these injuries are related to patient positioning. General considerations for perioperative nerve injuries are discussed here. Nerve injuries related to specific positions are discussed in subsequent sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2472091543\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve injury after anesthesia is a rare event, and the true incidence is unknown. Related literature consists mostly of case reports, retrospective reviews, and malpractice claims data. A review of over 380,000 surgical cases in one institution, using quality assurance, closed claims, and billing code databases, reported an incidence of perioperative nerve injury unrelated to surgery of 0.03 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Peripheral nerve injuries are an important medical legal issue. In the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claim Database, nerve injury accounted for 22 percent of malpractice injury claims between 1990 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, malpractice claims for nerve injury included those related to peripheral nerve blocks, neuraxial anesthesia, surgical trauma, and preexisting conditions. In many cases, the etiology of nerve injury was undetermined.</p><p>Peripheral nerve injury is a complex phenomenon that may occur during any type of anesthesia. Theoretically, patients who are awake or lightly sedated without regional anesthesia should be at lower risk of position-related nerve injury since they would be able to move an uncomfortable extremity. However, upper extremity nerve injury has been reported during neuraxial anesthesia and during monitored anesthesia care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154811101\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms for perioperative nerve injury are incompletely understood and may involve compression, ischemia, or stretch of nerves related to positioning but may also be related to preexisting patient factors (eg, preexisting subclinical neuropathy, diabetes, hypertension, body habitus), perioperative inflammation, or as yet undetermined factors.

The task force that created this document based their recommendations on observational studies, case reports, and expert opinion; recommendations are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111465 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H989439938\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and tissue injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immobilization places patients at risk for skin and underlying tissue injury during anesthesia, particularly during longer surgical procedures.

The incidence of these injuries in surgical patients varies widely by clinical setting, and is reported at between 10 and 37 percent during the hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2796547289\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple perioperative risk factors have been identified for development of perioperative pressure injuries, based on retrospective reviews. Risk factors include high preoperative Braden scale score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68532 \">table 2</a>), extremes of body mass index (BMI), older age, total surgery time, hypotension and vasopressor administration, diabetes, and high ASA risk score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. These risk factors overlap with the risk factors for intraoperative nerve injury.</p><p>However, risk factors specifically related to intraoperative management may be different. In a retrospective, observational cohort study, the electronic anesthesia and medical records of approximately 2700 critically ill surgical patients were reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Pressure injury occurred in 10.7 percent of patients and was associated with intraoperative blood product administration but not with operative case length, hypotension, or use of vasopressors. In another study, 208 patients who had surgery lasting more than four hours were prospectively followed for the development of pressure ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Effective preventive measures for pressure ulcers were not used, and 21 percent of patients developed pressure ulcers; 53 percent occurred on the heels, and 16 percent occurred in the sacral area.</p><p>Epidural analgesia has rarely been reported to lead to serious heel ulcers, even in young and fit patients without other risk factors, both in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Motor block associated with overly dense epidural block may restrict lower extremity movement, and sensory block can prevent discomfort related to pressure. For this and other reasons, the lowest effective doses of epidural drugs should be used, patients should be reminded to move their legs, and all care providers should routinely examine pressure points for signs of tissue damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475576096\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure redistribution is the most important factor in preventing pressure-induced injuries and may be accomplished by appropriate use of pressure-reducing devices and surfaces, frequent repositioning of the patient's head and limbs as possible, and proper patient positioning. Tissue pressures are greatest over bony prominences where weight-bearing points come in contact with external surfaces (eg, heels, occiput, sacrum, iliac crests, ischial tuberosity), and these sites should be padded or free. In addition, plastic connectors in intravenous tubing, stopcocks, and the wires and connectors of monitoring devices are potential points of pressure injury. All of these devices should be padded where they may press against skin, especially when extremities are wrapped or tucked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-risk-assessment-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76125456\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>In the operating room, a variety of padding materials are used to disperse pressure with the goal of avoiding tissue damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112451 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112452 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112450 \">figure 3</a>). It is not clear whether any particular type of padding material is better than others for prevention of tissue injury. High specification reactive or viscoelastic foam (ie, memory foam) and gel <span class=\"nowrap\">pads/supports</span> should be used, rather than standard pads or firm supports (eg, blankets or towels). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H784110401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Support surfaces'</a>.)</p><p>Egg crate foam may not be as effective as other padding materials, because it compresses over time and under heavy body parts. For short periods of time and under lighter body parts, foam may be as effective as gel or visco-elastic material.</p><p>Multilayer soft silicone foam dressing, such as Mepilex border sacral dressings (M&ouml;Inlycke Health Care), have been shown to reduce pressure ulcers in the critical care setting when placed in particularly susceptible locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Based on the type of surgery and necessary position, specific bony prominences may be at risk. We often place foam dressings on these particular bony prominences, such as the iliac crests during prone spine surgery.</p><p>For prevention of heel ulcers, elevating the leg so that the heel does not contact the mattress is the most effective preventive measure for bedridden patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and may be applicable in anesthetized patients as well. This can be accomplished with pillows placed beneath the knees. (See <a href=\"#H3472149443\" class=\"local\">'Particular concerns with the supine position'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1380594751\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative visual loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative visual loss, usually due to posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, occurs most commonly after spine surgery in the prone position but may also occur after other prolonged procedures, including those performed in the head down position (eg, robotic gynecologic and urologic procedures). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-visual-loss-after-anesthesia-for-nonocular-surgery#H94404125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative visual loss after anesthesia for nonocular surgery&quot;, section on 'Postoperative posterior ION'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630052605\"><span class=\"h2\">Operating tables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Movement of the operating room table while the patient is on it should be avoided. If the table must be moved, the patient should be secured and surrounded by operating room personnel on all sides to avoid having the patient shift or fall. The surgical table weight limits should be strictly followed; weight limit specifications are usually much lower if the table is tilted side to side or top to bottom. In addition, weight limits are lower if the patient is placed on the table in reverse orientation (ie, head placed at the foot of the table) because the patient's weight is no longer centered over the base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111332\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111332 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2973240759\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the supine (or dorsal decubitus) position, one or both arms may be abducted out to the side on arm boards or tucked next to the patient's body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112650\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112650 \">figure 5</a>). When the arms are adducted, they may be placed on padded arm supports or tucked using the lift sheet that goes under the patient. (See <a href=\"#H3472149443\" class=\"local\">'Particular concerns with the supine position'</a> below.)</p><p>A true horizontal supine position may place strain on the back, does not put the hips and knees in a neutral position, and may be poorly tolerated by awake patients. Therefore, the hips and knees should be flexed slightly by placing a pillow under the knees or configuring the operating table into a slight beach chair position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2738577481\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic effects of supine position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are minimal horizontal gradients in the vascular system in the supine position. Heart rate (HR) and peripheral vascular resistance are generally lower in the supine position compared with the sitting and prone positions. If the legs are elevated, venous return to the heart and cardiac output increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The supine position affects pulmonary physiology, primarily related to cranial displacement of the diaphragm by abdominal contents. Changing body position from upright to supine reduces functional residual capacity by 0.8 to 1 L (ie, from approximately 3.5 L to 2.5 L) and induction of anesthesia causes another decrease by 0.4 to 0.5 L [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A reduction in lung compliance, airway closure, and atelectasis can result. In addition, ventilation perfusion mismatch may occur during mechanical ventilation. Perfusion increases in dependent lung regions, while ventilation is more evenly distributed. Such changes are usually well tolerated by healthy patients but may be problematic for patients with obesity, pulmonary disease, and older patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults#H3186383247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung protective ventilation during anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults#H1824624174\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary effects of general anesthesia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H3691699838\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Ventilation management'</a>.)</p><p>Patients in advanced stages of pregnancy, or with a large mobile abdominal mass, may be at risk for aortocaval compression and hypotension in the supine position and may benefit from leftward tilt with a wedge under the right hip. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery#H474795097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative positioning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4057248013\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve injuries associated with supine positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arms should be positioned to minimize the chance of brachial plexus and ulnar nerve injuries, recognizing that the majority of perioperative nerve injuries occur despite what is considered optimal positioning. Guidelines for arm positioning are based on anatomical considerations, expert opinion, and equivocal evidence, which mostly consists of case reports and small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. We agree with generally accepted recommendations that the arms should be abducted less than 90 degrees, to avoid stretching the brachial plexus across the head of the humerus in the axilla.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ulnar nerve</strong> &ndash; The optimal position for the forearm with the arm abducted is unclear, though the goal should be to eliminate or minimize pressure on the ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove at the elbow. This may be accomplished with supination or a neutral arm position and should be individualized based on patient anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one study of awake volunteers, both supination and the neutral position of the forearm resulted in less pressure over the ulnar nerve than pronation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Arms adducted along the patient's side are usually placed in a neutral position, with the palm facing the patient. Similar to positioning with the arms abducted, no particular forearm position has been shown to reduce nerve injury. When the arms are abducted, the padded arm board should support the upper arm at the same level as the operating table mattress, to avoid impingement at the edge of the mattress. The forearm should be slightly flexed to avoid hyperextension at the elbow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110789 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radial nerve</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The radial nerve is rarely injured but is theoretically at risk for compression as it runs in the spiral groove of the humerus in the posterior upper arm, between the heads of the triceps muscle. Arm board padding should be even with the operating table mattress, without a step that could compress the nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110789 \">figure 6</a>). In addition, intravenous poles and devices attached to the operating table should be positioned away from the patient's upper arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachial plexus</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Brachial plexus injury has been associated with median sternotomy for cardiac surgery, particularly after asymmetric sternal retraction for dissection of the internal mammary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The injuries are usually to the lower roots of the brachial plexus, which may be stretched when sternal retraction rotates the first rib. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-complications-of-cardiac-surgery#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic complications of cardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Upper extremity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies of the effect of arm positioning during sternal retraction on the incidence of brachial plexus injury have yielded conflicting results, and data are insufficient to recommend a particular arm position. Some studies have found that the hands up position (ie, arms adducted 90 degrees, elbows flexed) reduces brachial plexus injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], compared with arms at the side, and others have found no difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,26</a>]. Patients positioned with arms at the side may be at increased risk of ulnar nerve compression and injury.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3472149443\"><span class=\"h2\">Particular concerns with the supine position</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure points</strong> &ndash; In the supine position, bony prominences in contact with the operating table mattress, arm boards, and head supports are at risk for skin pressure damage and should be adequately padded. Prolonged pressure on the occiput can cause alopecia, which may be permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and the heels and sacrum are at risk for pressure sores, especially during longer procedures. Protective measures include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pillows can be placed under the lower legs to elevate the heels, or special heel protectors may be used. The feet should be supported without pressure on the Achilles tendon and without the knee hyperextended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The head should be supported in a foam or gel donut shaped pad, to eliminate pressure on the occiput (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112452 \">figure 2</a>). When possible, intermittent slight repositioning of the head during anesthesia may relieve pressure on specific areas of the occiput and reduce the risk of alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In healthy, un-anesthetized patients, heart rate (HR) and sympathetic tone increase to maintain blood pressure, but these compensatory mechanisms may be blunted during general anesthesia.

Thus, the lateral lower leg should be either free or padded when stirrups are used. Superficial peroneal nerve dysfunction has also been associated with lithotomy positioning and results in sensory neuropathy without a motor deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Hip flexion beyond 90 degrees has been shown to stretch the inguinal ligaments, and since the lateral femoral cutaneous and obturator nerves pass directly through these ligaments, this extreme angle should be avoided. A cadaver study showed stretch of the obturator nerve with hip flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sciatic nerve</strong> &ndash; The sciatic nerve can be stretched at the level of the hip or knee or may be compressed distally in the popliteal fossa. The degree of hip flexion or abduction, or knee extension, that may cause sciatic nerve injury has not been determined. As a general rule, the position of the hips and knees during anesthesia should be limited to those that are comfortable preoperatively.

Thus, safe position of the hands should always be confirmed prior to moving, removing, or replacing the foot of the table.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compartment syndrome</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Compartment syndrome without an apparent cause is a rare occurrence after surgery and anesthesia and may be more likely when the patient is in the lithotomy position compared with supine. Compartment syndrome can occur in any surgical position and may affect both lower and upper extremities, though most case reports after anesthesia occurred in a lower extremity in patients in lithotomy. A retrospective review of approximately 575,000 anesthetics reported 13 cases of compartment syndrome; 1 of 8720 cases occurred in lithotomy position, compared with 1 of 92,441 cases in the supine position and 1 of 9700 patients in lateral decubitus position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In that review, compartment syndrome was associated with longer surgical procedures (ie, &gt;2 to 3 hours).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The cause of potentially position-related compartment syndrome is unknown, and the pathophysiology of acute compartment syndrome is complex. Ultimately, tissue perfusion and muscle oxygenation are compromised when tissue pressure approaches MAP.

Possible mechanisms for compartment syndrome in this setting include the weight of the extremity on supports, reduced perfusion pressure with the limb elevated, and position-related reduction of the capacity of the affected compartment. Calf pressures in the well leg may be increased by obesity and the use of calf support rather than heel support, and pressures increase over time during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. For patients who have surgery in the hemilithotomy position, we avoid intraoperative hypotension and hypovolemia in order to maintain perfusion of the well leg. We discuss alternative positioning with the surgeon for obese patients and for procedures that are likely to go beyond two hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Back pain</strong> &ndash; The lithotomy position may aggravate radicular pain in patients with a preexisting herniated lumbar disk. This position can also cause back pain in patients without preexisting back problems by removing the normal lordotic curve. In patients with known back or lower extremity radicular pain, the position should be rehearsed with the patient awake to allow modifications, though back or radicular pain may still occur.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2645459452\"><span class=\"h1\">LATERAL DECUBITUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lateral decubitus position may be used for surgery on the thorax, retroperitoneal structures, or hip. The patient lies with the operative side up, with anterior and posterior supports (eg, blanket or gel rolls, or a bean bag support) to prevent rolling to the supine or prone position during surgery. The legs are slightly flexed, with pillows or foam padding between them. A pad or roll is placed under the chest wall, to alleviate pressure on the neurovascular structures in the axilla. The down arm is padded, and the up arm is supported on pillows or any of a number of arm supports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106621 \">figure 16</a>).</p><p>When the operating table is flexed in the lateral decubitus position, with or without a kidney rest (eg, for thoracotomy or retroperitoneal surgery), the point of flexion should be beneath the iliac crest to minimize compression of the dependent lung and the inferior vena cava.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1657721279\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic effects of lateral decubitus positioning</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular effects</strong> &ndash; In the flexed lateral decubitus position, blood may pool in the dependent lower extremities, causing reduced venous return to the central circulation and hypotension. In addition, the inferior venous cava can be partially or completely obstructed by marked flexion at the hips. In one study of 12 patients who underwent nephrectomy, the change from the lateral to flexed lateral (ie, operating table flexed 30 degrees, with kidney rest elevated at iliac crest) resulted in significant reductions in blood pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressures, cardiac index, and stroke volume, with an increased in systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Wrapping the legs in compressive elastic or using sequential compressive devices may decrease this change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary effects</strong> &ndash; The lateral decubitus position can result in ventilation perfusion mismatch in anesthetized patients. When anesthetized, mechanically ventilated patients are turned from the supine to lateral position, perfusion of the dependent lung usually increases, while ventilation of the dependent lung decreases, due to reduced functional residual capacity and compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. At the same time, ventilation increases and perfusion decreases in the nondependent lung. The resultant ventilation perfusion mismatch can cause hypoxemia in patients with reduced pulmonary reserve, and a high fraction of inspired oxygen may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2993592731\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve injuries associated with the lateral decubitus position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The brachial plexus is at risk for injury in the lateral decubitus position if a chest pad or roll is not properly placed. Though this device is often called the axillary roll, it should not be placed in the axilla. Rather, the chest should be supported caudal to the axilla, to free the axillary structures from compression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106621 \">figure 16</a>). If a deflatable bean bag is used to support the patient, the upper edge should similarly be below the level of the axilla. The radial pulse should be monitored in the dependent arm (eg, by placing pulse oximeter on a finger on the down arm), as an indication of vascular patency (and, presumably, lack of pressure on the brachial plexus).</p><p>The brachial plexus and other nerves that arise from cervical nerve roots may be stretched and injured if the neck is flexed laterally. The head should be supported in a neutral position continuously during the positioning process, to avoid such injuries. The table should be flexed slowly, with the head supported, and padding added as necessary to keep the neck in a neutral position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The dependent arm should be placed on a padded arm board, such that the upper arm is abducted no more than 90 degrees to the torso, to avoid stretch of the brachial plexus. The upper portion of the nondependent arm should be parallel to the dependent arm and should be supported on pillows, blankets, or on an arm cradle. Perfusion of the arms should be monitored with palpation of pulses, a blood pressure cuff, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> continuous pulse oximetry.</p><p>If the upper arm needs to be abducted more than 90 degrees (eg, during thoracotomy), the time in this position should be minimized. The fibular head of the down leg should be padded to avoid peroneal injury. The saphenous nerve is at risk for injury, as it courses along the medial femoral condyle, and should be padded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3387515387\"><span class=\"h2\">Particular concerns with lateral decubitus position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is anesthetized and the airway secured in the supine position and then turned to the lateral position. The turning process must be coordinated among operating room care providers, to prevent patient injury and dislodgement of the airway device, intravenous catheters, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monitoring devices. The head should be positioned on a foam or gel support, without pressure on the eyes, and with the ears flat to the head.

If the arms are positioned with the hands up, arms should not be overextended, to avoid stretching or compressing the neurovascular bundles in the axilla, although there are no available data to support a recommendation for the maximal degree of extension at the shoulder joint. The patient's range of motion at the shoulder joint should be tested preoperatively to determine the safe degree of extension.</p><p>Chest rolls should not compress the axillary structures.

The goals are to avoid patient injury, prevent dislodgement of the airway device, intravenous and monitoring catheters (eg, arterial catheter), and to minimize physiologic effects during the turn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For general anesthesia, after induction of and intubation, the endotracheal tube should be well secured, the eyes should be closed and taped, a soft bite block or blocks placed, and a nasal or oral temperature probe placed. If the patient's head is to be supported on a foam headrest, the headrest is placed over the patient's face while supine, making sure that the eyes and nose are free in the respective openings in the device, and turned in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112450 \">figure 3</a>). Before turning prone, both the operating table and stretcher should be locked and positioned as closely together as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In anticipation of the turn, we administer 100 percent oxygen to prevent desaturation while ventilation is interrupted. Intravenous tubing and arterial line transducer tubing should be positioned along the patient's side to avoid dislodgement while turning. Monitoring cables may be disconnected for the turn but should be replaced as soon as possible. We maintain either pulse oximetry or invasive blood pressure monitoring throughout the turn and positioning whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The breathing circuit should be disconnected at the last possible moment prior to turning, when all involved individuals are in place and ready. During the turn, the patient's neck should be kept in a neutral position. The arm over which the patient rolls should be along the patient's side to prevent injury. After the turn, the endotracheal tube should be reconnected and adequate ventilation confirmed, and monitors should be reconnected as quickly as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We keep the stretcher in the operating room after turning prone until it is clear that the patient has tolerated the turn and the airway is secure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Torso support</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Firm rolls or bolsters that extend from the clavicle to the iliac crests should be placed laterally, to minimize pressure on the abdomen and thorax and the associated physiologic changes. (See <a href=\"#H155734263\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of prone positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of support devices are available for use in prone positioning. The Wilson frame is one such device, which tends to keep the head below the level of the heart and is associated with development of postoperative visual loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F100534\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100534 \">figure 19</a>).

Some require placing skull pins to hold the head, while others allow the choice of a head cradle with foam or gel inserts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should be positioned with the head at or above the level of the heart in the prone position, to avoid venous congestion of the face. The breasts, iliac crests, and genitalia should be positioned to avoid compression and padded as appropriate. If a Foley catheter is placed, it should hang free after positioning without traction on the genitalia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neck position</strong> &ndash; The neck should be placed in a neutral position, without excessive flexion or extension relative to the torso, or in the natural position for patients with neck deformities. This may require changing the height of the torso or head support, adding or removing padding under the face pillow, or changing the height or angle of the Mayfield apparatus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient's ability to rotate the neck should be tested preoperatively if the head will be turned. Lateral rotation of the head and neck can stretch the roots of the cervical plexus and the neurovascular bundle at the head of the humerus and can compress the nerves and vessels between the clavicle and first rib. Severe head rotation can also obstruct the carotid and vertebral arteries and jugular veins and has rarely led to cerebral infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protecting the face</strong> &ndash; There are multiple pillows designed with cutouts for the eyes, nose, and mouth. The head is supported on the bony prominences of the face (ie, the forehead and the chin). The horseshoe headrest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F100127\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100127 \">picture 4</a>) should be avoided because of close proximity to the eyes and multiple reports of central retinal artery occlusion with its use.

The head can be elevated to a varying degree, and many shoulder surgeons request 20 degrees of elevation, rather than the 45 degrees that was historically used. </p><p>The head is fixed in skull pins for neurosurgical procedures and supported with tape or a face support for shoulder surgery. The arms are supported on padded arm boards or arm supports. Advantages for the surgeon include improved surgical exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] and possibly reduced blood loss during neurosurgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and access to the shoulder with improved mobility of the joint, and less blood in the surgical field for orthopedic surgeries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H400335488\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic effects of sitting position</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiovascular effects</strong> &ndash; Cardiovascular changes are the most important physiologic effects of the sitting position. Venous pooling in the lower extremities, along with the vasodilation and myocardial depression that accompany general anesthesia, can produce a decrease in cardiac preload, stroke volume, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral perfusion pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Hemodynamic changes can be mitigated by intravenous fluid administration, positioning with the hips flexed and the legs elevated, compression stockings, and gradual, incremental head elevation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerebral perfusion</strong> &ndash; A number of cases of stroke, ischemic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and death have been reported in patients who had shoulder surgery in the beach chair position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

The incidence of more minor neurologic injury is also unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Efforts to prevent neurologic injury in the beach chair position have focused on the maintenance of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. The effects of the sitting position on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation are complex and are not completely understood. As the head is raised above the heart in unanesthetized patients, cerebral perfusion pressure decreases by approximately 15 percent, and systemic vascular resistance increases by 50 to 80 percent to compensate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. General anesthesia usually blunts such compensatory mechanisms, and cerebral hypoperfusion can result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/29,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,58</a>]. Hypocapnia associated with mechanical ventilation results in cerebral vasoconstriction and may further reduce cerebral perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H336791146\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cerebral autoregulation</strong> &ndash; It has been traditionally thought that cerebral autoregulation should maintain cerebral blood flow constant between MAP from 50 to 150 mmHg. However, there is wide individual variation in the range of autoregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], among surgical patients in general, and in patients in the beach chair position in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In some patients (eg, patients with chronic hypertension, older patients) the set point for autoregulation is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Thus, a MAP significantly higher than 50 mmHg may be required to prevent cerebral ischemia in the sitting position, and without definitive evidence to support a specific goal blood pressure, we maintain a MAP &gt;70 mmHg for patients in this position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;, section on 'Autoregulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cerebral oxygenation</strong> &ndash; Cerebral oxygen desaturation events may be more common in patients in the beach chair position compared with other positions for surgery. Several studies have reported a high incidence of cerebral desaturation, measured by near infrared spectroscopy, in patients placed in the beach chair position for shoulder surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. In one study, cerebral oxygen saturation (SctO2) was measured in 140 patients who underwent shoulder surgery, half in the beach chair position and half in the lateral decubitus position. Cerebral desaturation events, defined as &ge;20 percent decrease from baseline or absolute value &le;55 percent) occurred in 80 percent of patients in the beach chair position compared with 0 percent in the patients in lateral decubitus position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. There were no difference is hemodynamic variables.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Management of ventilation during anesthesia is known to affect cerebral blood flow and may affect cerebral oxygenation in the beach chair position. In one study including 56 anesthetized patients in the beach chair position, increasing end tidal carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from 30 to 45 mmHg, combined with increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen from 0.3 to 1.0, resulted in an increase in regional cerebral oxygenation from 68 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The clinical implications of cerebral desaturation events is unclear, and cerebral desaturation events have not correlated with neurologic injury. Further study is required before recommending the routine measurement of cerebral oximetry for patients in the beach chair position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Goal blood pressure</strong> &ndash; Definitive, evidence-based guidelines for management of blood pressure, with the goal of maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion in the sitting position, have not been established. This issue is particularly important when surgeons request induced hypotension to improve surgical conditions. We suggest correcting MAP measurements for the hydrostatic difference between the blood pressure cuff and the brain for patients in the sitting position, and we aggressively treat blood pressure values below 80 percent of the preoperative resting values, while maintaining a MAP &gt;70 mmHg. We aim for the patient's baseline blood pressure for older patients, hypertensive patients, and others at risk for cerebrovascular disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">It is widely accepted that blood pressure should be measured at the level of the brain (ie, the transducer zeroed at the external auditory meatus) when intraarterial pressure monitoring is used and that noninvasive blood pressure should be corrected for the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the cuff and the brain. This would mean that for every 1 cm difference between the cuff and the auditory meatus, MAP would be 0.77 mmHg lower at the brain than measured by the cuff (ie, 1 mmHg for every 1.25 cm). Using this calculation, a patient in the beach chair position with the external auditory meatus 30 cm above the midpoint of the blood pressure cuff, MAP at the brain would be unacceptably low, at approximately 47 mmHg, with a MAP of 70 mmHg as measured by the cuff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Effect of anesthetic technique</strong> &ndash; Cerebral desaturation events may be less likely during regional anesthesia in the beach chair position compared with general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. In one observation study, cerebral desaturation (ie, SctO2 decrease &gt;20 percent from baseline) occurred in 58 percent of patients who had general anesthesia in the beach chair position, compared with no desaturation events if regional anesthesia was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The reasons for less cerebral desaturation with regional anesthesia are unclear but may include better preservation of blood pressure and higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) during regional anesthesia. Cerebral desaturation with general anesthesia may be unrelated to effects on blood flow. In one study, cerebral blood flow was measured by carotid Doppler in 40 patients randomly assigned to general or regional anesthesia for shoulder surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. MAP was maintained at &gt;70 mmHg, and there was no difference in cerebral blood flow between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We prefer to use regional anesthesia when possible for shoulder surgery in the beach chair position.

Pressure redistribution is the most important factor in preventing pressure induced injury and may be accomplished by the use of pressure-reducing surfaces and padding, particularly over bony prominences. (See <a href=\"#H989439938\" class=\"local\">'Skin and tissue injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the supine position, we suggest that the arms should be abducted &le;90 degrees and should be placed in a neutral or supinated without pressure on the ulnar groove at the elbow (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4057248013\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injuries associated with supine positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The arms, sacrum, and occiput should be positioned and padded with gel or viscoelastic material to avoid pressure-induced injury for patients in any of the supine positions (ie, supine, Trendelenburg, reverse Trendelenburg, lithotomy). Heels should be supported such that there is no contact with the operating table mattress. (See <a href=\"#H3472149443\" class=\"local\">'Particular concerns with the supine position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Trendelenburg position causes increased intracranial pressure and increased intraocular pressure. Prolonged steep Trendelenburg can cause edema of the face and airway structures and can cause airway obstruction after extubation. (See <a href=\"#H402644297\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of Trendelenburg positioning'</a> above and <a href=\"#H872265684\" class=\"local\">'Airway concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We do not use shoulder supports for patients in the Trendelenburg position, to avoid injury to the brachial plexus. If they are used, shoulder supports should be placed laterally, at the acromioclavicular joint. (See <a href=\"#H4057248013\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injuries associated with supine positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the reverse Trendelenburg position, cross table straps may be insufficient to prevent patient movement, and a padded foot board may be required. The cardiovascular effects of extreme reverse Trendelenburg positioning may be similar to the effects of the sitting position. (See <a href=\"#H2535301564\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of reverse Trendelenburg position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the lithotomy position, the peroneal nerve, saphenous nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, and sciatic nerves are at risk for injury from compression or stretch. The legs should be positioned without hyperextension or flexion, and bony prominences should be padded. The legs should be raised into position simultaneously by two attendants and taken out of the lithotomy position in the same way. (See <a href=\"#H354091948\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injuries associated with lithotomy position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compartment syndrome has rarely occurred during anesthesia and is more common in the lithotomy position. Compartment syndrome may occur in the nonoperative leg when placed in the hemilithotomy position on the fracture table. For patients in the hemilithotomy position, we avoid hypotension and hypovolemia, and we discuss alternate positioning with the surgeon for obese patients and for procedures that are expected to go beyond two hours. (See <a href=\"#H3062511799\" class=\"local\">'Particular concerns with lithotomy position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the lateral decubitus position, the patient should be supported with rolls or bolsters to prevent rolling into the supine or prone position. The chest support (ie, axillary roll) should be placed <strong>caudal</strong> to the axilla to avoid compression of neurovascular structures. The head should be supported in a neutral position, and the dependent arm should be abducted &le;90 degrees. (See <a href=\"#H2993592731\" class=\"local\">'Nerve injuries associated with the lateral decubitus position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the flexed lateral decubitus position, the table should be flexed at the iliac crest, rather than at the flank, to minimize compression of the vena cave and thoracic structures. (See <a href=\"#H1657721279\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of lateral decubitus positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The turning process for the prone position should be coordinated among the care providers in the operating room. The goals are to avoid patient injury; prevent dislodgement of the airway device, intravenous catheters, and monitoring catheters; and to minimize physiologic effects during the turn. (See <a href=\"#H582426954\" class=\"local\">'Particular concerns with the prone position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The torso should be supported on firm rolls or bolsters that extend from the clavicle to the iliac crests, placed laterally to avoid abdominal compression. Breasts and genitalia should not be compressed, and the neck should be in a neutral position. The eyes and nose should be free from pressure and should be checked regularly during surgery. The head should be positioned at or above the level of the heart. Rare cases of postoperative visual loss have occurred in patients in the prone position. (See <a href=\"#H1380594751\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative visual loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H582426954\" class=\"local\">'Particular concerns with the prone position'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-visual-loss-after-anesthesia-for-nonocular-surgery#H571004335\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative visual loss after anesthesia for nonocular surgery&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular effects are the most important physiologic changes associated with the sitting position. Venous pooling in the lower extremities, along with the vasodilation and myocardial depression due to general anesthesia, can produce a decrease in cardiac preload, stroke volume, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). (See <a href=\"#H400335488\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic effects of sitting position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rare cases of stroke, ischemic brain injury, and spinal cord injury have been reported in patients who underwent shoulder surgery in the beach chair position. Cerebral perfusion and oxygenation should be maintained, to minimize the risk of such injuries. We suggest the following strategy for patients who have shoulder surgery in the beach chair position:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Correct blood pressure measurement for the hydrostatic difference between the blood pressure cuff and the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For every 1 cm difference between the cuff and the auditory meatus, MAP would be 0.77 mmHg lower at the brain than measured by the cuff (ie, 1 mmHg for every 1.25 cm).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">When invasive blood pressure monitoring is used, the transducer should be zeroed at the level of the auditory meatus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintain MAP within 20 percent of baseline preoperative resting value and &ge;70 mmHg (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer to use regional anesthesia when possible for patients who have shoulder surgery in the beach chair position, rather than general anesthesia.</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Welch MB, Brummett CM, Welch TD, et al.
