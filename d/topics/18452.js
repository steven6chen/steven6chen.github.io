Some immunizations are safe to give during pregnancy, while others should be given at least one month before becoming pregnant. Some immunizations are recommended for all women during pregnancy, while others may be recommended for women who are at high risk of becoming infected during pregnancy, but are not recommended for pregnant women at low risk of infection.</p><p>Immunizations for nonpregnant adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINES RECOMMENDED BEFORE PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women planning pregnancy should have received all routine vaccinations as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-children-and-adolescents-overview#H645243885\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview&quot;, section on 'Routine schedule'</a>.)</p><p>The measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (varicella) vaccines are particularly important for women of childbearing age who are susceptible to these infections and who may become pregnant because these vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy, and infection occurring in nonimmune pregnant women can adversely affect pregnancy outcome. Most American women of childbearing age are immune to these infections because of routine vaccinations given during childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148297418\"><span class=\"h2\">Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider can determine if you are immune to these infections by performing a blood test. If you are not immune, you should have the MMR vaccine at least one month before becoming pregnant. Contracting a measles, mumps, or rubella (German measles) infection in early pregnancy can cause miscarriage. Rubella infection in early pregnancy can also cause severe birth defects, including deafness and defects involving the eyes, heart, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brain. Maternal infection in the second half of pregnancy is unlikely to cause these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Varicella (chickenpox)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Becoming infected with chickenpox (varicella) during pregnancy, especially early pregnancy, increases the risk of birth defects. Chickenpox anytime in pregnancy can cause serious complications for the pregnant woman, such as pneumonia.</p><p>If you have never had chickenpox or the varicella vaccine, your health care provider can determine if you are immune by performing a blood test. If you are not immune, you should have the varicella vaccine at least one month before becoming pregnant.</p><p>If you are not immune to varicella and are exposed to someone with chickenpox while pregnant, contact your health care provider as soon as possible. There is a treatment called varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG) that can help to reduce the risk of becoming infected with chickenpox. VariZIG can be given within 10 days of exposure, but should be given as soon as possible. </p><p>Shingles is much less contagious than chickenpox and usually requires very close contact or direct exposure to open skin lesions for transmission to occur. If you are not immune to varicella and have been exposed to someone with shingles, you should call your health care provider and <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> will decide whether treatment with VariZIG is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster virus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Human papillomavirus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for nonpregnant girls and women 9 to 26 years of age. Administration of the HPV vaccine during pregnancy is not recommended, although evidence suggests it is safe if pregnant women receive it inadvertently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525731036\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINES RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WOMEN IN EVERY PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza (flu)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women are at especially high risk of developing complications of the flu. Vaccination against the seasonal flu is recommended for <strong>all</strong> women who are or will be pregnant during influenza season. Influenza vaccine injection (flu shot) during pregnancy has no known harmful effects on the unborn baby, and can help protect the baby from influenza in the first six months after birth, before the baby is eligible for the flu vaccine. The nasal spray influenza vaccine should be avoided because it is made from a live virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is recommended for pregnant women in each pregnancy, and should be given as early as possible between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, to help protect the newborn from pertussis infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINES RECOMMENDED FOR SELECTED PREGNANT WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women who are at high risk of certain infections due to travel or other circumstance should consider additional vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause severe illness in pregnant women and can be passed to the fetus. The vaccine carries no known risks to the developing fetus.</p><p>The hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for pregnant women who are at risk for developing the illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis A (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis B is a serious infection that causes inflammation of the liver. A series of three hepatitis B vaccines is now routinely given during childhood, although many adults have not been vaccinated. The vaccine carries no known risks to the developing fetus.</p><p>The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for pregnant women who are at high risk for acquiring hepatitis B during pregnancy (eg, unimmunized women who live with someone infected with hepatitis B), and also for women who started the immunization series before becoming pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Poliomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poliomyelitis (polio) is caused by a virus that can lead to permanent paralysis. Polio has been eliminated from the Americas and most other developed countries, but a number of other countries are still affected by large polio outbreaks. Pregnant women should avoid travel, if possible, to areas where polio is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A vaccine is available to prevent polio. However, polio vaccination is not usually recommended during pregnancy due to a lack of information about the vaccine's safety. If travel to an area where polio is prevalent is not avoidable, you should be immunized with the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poliovirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumococcus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumococci are bacteria that are the leading cause of pneumonia and a number of other infections, including otitis media (ear infection) and meningitis. Women at high risk for pneumococcal infections should be given the pneumococcal vaccine.</p><p>Ideally, the vaccine should be given before pregnancy. However, the pneumococcus vaccine appears to be safe when given in the second and third trimesters (there is not enough information about the safety of the vaccine during the first trimester). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Yellow fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. It is associated with liver and kidney damage and hemorrhage, and often leads to death. The disease occurs in tropical regions of South America and sub-Saharan Africa; these areas should be avoided during pregnancy, if possible.</p><p>If travel is not avoidable and the risk of yellow fever is high, immunization with a live virus vaccine may be considered. You should consult an infectious disease specialist if yellow fever vaccination is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccines against a number of other infections are available, including cholera, meningococcus, plague, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, typhoid, smallpox, and Haemophilus influenzae B. A health care provider can determine the risk of exposure to these illnesses and the need for immunization during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Zoster vaccine should not be administered to pregnant women as it is a live vaccine. Although it is indicated for patients &ge;50 years of age, which is past the age of natural childbearing, childbearing with use of assisted reproductive techniques occurs in this age group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=5592\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
