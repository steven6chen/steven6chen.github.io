The likelihood that a specific complication will arise for a given patient is determined by the nature of the procedure, the anesthetic techniques used, the patient's comorbidities, and preoperative medical assessment and optimization.</p><p>This topic serves as an overview for post-anesthetic care and the most common problems encountered in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Preoperative evaluation and preventive strategies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2497599768\"><span class=\"h1\">PHASES IN THE POST-ANESTHESIA CARE UNIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common practice for most patients who receive general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care to be monitored in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) prior to discharge from the hospital or transfer to a ward bed. The exception is critically ill patients and those who are intubated, who may bypass the PACU and be recovered directly in an intensive care unit (ICU). In most PACUs, medical oversight of patients is the responsibility of the anesthesiology service. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4198864902\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial handoff</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial handoff from the anesthesia care team and other intraoperative personnel (eg, circulating nurse and surgeon) to personnel in the PACU is typically standardized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110928\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110928 \">table 1</a>). This handoff includes review of pertinent medical history, allergies, the surgical procedure performed; total dose and last timing for opioids, muscle relaxants, and antibiotics; total fluids administered including colloids and blood products; critical intraoperative laboratory values if these were obtained (eg, hemoglobin or hematocrit, glucose and potassium levels, last activated whole blood clotting time [ACT] if heparin was administered), airway management and any difficulties; untoward intraoperative events; prophylactic medications previously administered for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); the plan for postoperative analgesia; and discussion of disposition after PACU discharge (eg, to home, a hospital ward, or an ICU bed). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-handoffs#H376248968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient handoffs&quot;, section on 'The handoff process'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-handoffs#H376248983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient handoffs&quot;, section on 'Strategies for effective handoffs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2860377297\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase I and II care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PACU care is typically divided into two phases. Phase I emphasizes ensuring the patient's full recovery from anesthesia and return of vital signs to near baseline. Phase II recovery focuses on preparing patients for hospital discharge, including education regarding the surgeon's postoperative instructions and any prescribed discharge medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1517658997\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT, MONITORING, AND CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2827314194\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment and care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway patency, respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), the electrocardiogram (ECG), mental status, temperature, and the presence of pain, nausea, or vomiting are assessed upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Neuromuscular function is also assessed by physical examination; a peripheral nerve stimulator may be employed for patients who remain intubated and received a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) intraoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu#H3859137208\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory problems in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)&quot;, section on 'Neuromuscular blocking agents'</a>.) Intake and output (eg, fluid administration, urine output, bleeding, wound drainage) are calculated shortly after arrival in the PACU to evaluate postoperative hydration status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-fluid-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative fluid management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Supplemental oxygen is administered to patients who received sedation or general anesthesia to avoid or treat hypoxemia in the PACU (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F60610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60610 \">table 2</a>). Standard care also includes assessments and immediate treatment of postoperative pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a>), nausea or vomiting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>), and temperature abnormalities (see <a href=\"#H816154108\" class=\"local\">'Hypothermia or hyperthermia'</a> below). Specific wound or dressing management ordered by the surgical team may be necessary after certain procedures (eg, ice packs, continuous bladder irrigation). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4275949016\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment after neuraxial block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to standard assessments, the degree of analgesic efficacy and gradual return of motor and sensory function are documented in patients who have received a neuraxial block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795596143\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Monitoring the patient who has received neuraxial analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>Suspected complications of a neuraxial anesthetic, in particular spinal-epidural hematoma (SEH), may require urgent assessment and treatment (see <a href=\"#H2346585878\" class=\"local\">'Spinal epidural hematoma'</a> below). Other possible complications include transient neurologic symptoms, postdural puncture headache, backache, and urinary retention; these are discussed in detail in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neuraxial-anesthesia#H2261645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neuraxial anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects and complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H788021902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1500379284\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial assessment and stabilization, RR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR, and ECG are monitored continuously, while airway patency, BP, mental status, neuromuscular function, and temperature are frequently reassessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are no evidence-based guidelines regarding frequency of vital sign monitoring in the PACU. Vital signs are typically obtained every five minutes for the first 15 minutes, then every 15 minutes for the duration of the Phase I period. Typically, HR and BP are maintained within approximately 20 percent of baseline values for the individual patient, while RR and SpO<sub>2</sub> are maintained as close to baseline levels as possible. </p><p>During Phase II recovery, vital signs are typically obtained every 30 to 60 minutes. For patients remaining in the PACU due to logistical reasons after discharge criteria have been met (eg, lack of inpatient bed availability or a ride home), vital signs are obtained only when indicated or at the same frequency employed in the hospital unit to which the patient will be transferred.</p><p>A record is maintained to document vital signs and other assessments, as well as medications administered throughout the patient's PACU stay, similar to record-keeping in the operating room. Whether documentation is completed with a paper record or electronic medical record is institution-dependent. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1271068\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective review involving 18,473 patients noted that the most common problem in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is postoperative nausea and vomiting (9.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other complications involved the upper airway (6.9 percent) or cardiovascular system (eg, hypotension [2.7 percent], dysrhythmias [1.4 percent], hypertension [1.1 percent], major cardiac events [0.6 percent]). In a review of 419 PACU incident reports from the Australian Incident Monitoring Study (AIMS), 44 percent were upper airway or respiratory complications, while 24 percent were cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Neurologic complications (eg, delayed emergence, emergence delirium, vision loss, spinal epidural hematoma after neuraxial anesthesia) were less common in both reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1324456782\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE NAUSEA AND VOMITING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the most commonly treated problem in the immediate postoperative period. Control of PONV is a necessary criterion for discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), regardless of whether the patient is going home or to a hospital ward. Risk factors, preventive strategies, and treatment of PONV are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1275230\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of bronchospasm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaphylaxis in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is the same as management in the operating room (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F107933\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107933 \">table 3</a>).

These conditions are typically temporary and gradually resolve over 30 to 60 minutes. In rare cases, the cause is a serious neurologic or medical condition requiring urgent intervention. Management of delayed emergence and delirium in the PACU is addressed separately.

Typically, the patient complains of the sensation of a foreign body in the affected eye. Causes, diagnosis and management of corneal abrasion are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-visual-loss-after-anesthesia-for-nonocular-surgery#H94404077\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative visual loss after anesthesia for nonocular surgery&quot;, section on 'Corneal abrasion'</a>.)</p><p>Although rare, a patient may awaken from anesthesia with partial or complete loss of vision (with or without pain), prompting the need for urgent ophthalmologic consultation. Causes that require immediate treatment include ischemic optic neuropathy, cerebral visual loss, or retinal artery occlusion, as well as less common causes such as acute angle-closure glaucoma, retrobulbar hematoma, or pituitary apoplexy. Causes, diagnosis and management of postoperative vision loss are discussed separately.

Patients who have received medications affecting hemostasis (eg, anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents), particularly those having vascular surgery, are at highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication#H550476494\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication&quot;, section on 'Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH)'</a>.) Risk is very low in obstetric patients. </p><p>Since epidural catheters are often placed just prior to induction of anesthesia, presence of an epidural hematoma may not become apparent until the effects of anesthetics and sedatives have worn off. The most common presenting symptoms for neurologically significant SEH are progressive motor block, sensory block, or bowel and bladder dysfunction; back pain is a less common presenting complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>If an epidural hematoma is suspected, emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed (or computed tomography [CT] scan if MRI is contraindicated). If SEH is detected, urgent consultation with the neurosurgery or orthopedic spine surgery service is necessary for possible decompressive laminectomy since neurologic recovery is more likely if decompression occurs within eight hours of symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication#H703631320\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication&quot;, section on 'Prevention of neurologic damage from spinal hematoma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816154108\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOTHERMIA OR HYPERTHERMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative temperature derangements are common; thus, temperature is measured during initial assessment upon arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Both hypothermia and hyperthermia have negative consequences in the immediate postoperative period, and either may cause shivering <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thermal discomfort. These problems are promptly treated, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-temperature-management#H1029603522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative temperature management&quot;, section on 'Postoperative temperature derangements'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154735179\"><span class=\"h1\">INABILITY TO VOID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is common following anesthesia. The incidence varies widely, ranging from 5 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the absence of urologic pathology, postoperative inability to void is usually transient, but may be prolonged in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative urinary retention in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-complications-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair#H84861277\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of complications of inguinal and femoral hernia repair&quot;, section on 'Urinary retention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194770753\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for POUR are patient-specific, procedure-specific, and anesthetic-specific.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient</strong> <strong>factors</strong> &ndash; Older age, male gender, history of preexisting urinary retention, neurologic disease (eg, cerebral palsy, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis), or prior pelvic surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Procedural factors</strong> &ndash; Anorectal surgery, joint arthroplasty, hernia repair, or incontinence surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anesthetic factors</strong> &ndash; Excessive fluid administration, selected medications (eg, opioids, anticholinergic agents, beta-blockers, sympathomimetics), prolonged duration of anesthesia, and type of anesthesia (with neuraxial anesthesia being more likely to cause POUR compared with general anesthesia).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194770760\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are unable to void in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) may or may not complain of bladder fullness or lower abdominal discomfort, and physical examination is not sufficiently sensitive to detect bladder volume before the development of overdistention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, bladder volume is measured directly either with ultrasound or by draining the bladder, which requires catheterization. We prefer bladder ultrasound because this noninvasive technique will usually confirm the diagnosis. This technique is employed in any patient with risk factors for POUR who remains unable to void four hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. If &gt;600 mL is measured on ultrasound, or if the patient has discomfort with suspected inaccuracy of the ultrasound measurement (eg, due to body habitus, tissue edema, prior surgery with scarring), a one-time bladder catheterization is performed while the patient is still in the PACU. The volume of urine drained in the first 10 to 15 minutes after bladder catheterization should be noted and recorded. If volume exceeds 400 mL in a patient who will be admitted as a hospital inpatient, the catheter may be left in place. Clean intermittent catheterization is another option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention#H19833970\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;, section on 'Acute management'</a>.) </p><p>The bladder catheter is typically removed before discharge home in an ambulatory patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In some cases, ambulatory patients who have &lt;600 mL of urine measured with bladder ultrasound may be discharged home before spontaneously voiding. However, all patients who were unable to spontaneously void prior to discharge are instructed to seek medical assistance if they are still unable to void eight hours after discharge.

Several scoring systems have been developed, both for the Phase I and Phase II PACU periods (see <a href=\"#H2497599768\" class=\"local\">'Phases in the post-anesthesia care unit'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. For example, the Postanesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS) is based on vital signs, activity level, nausea or vomiting, pain, surgical bleeding, and intake and output; criteria for discharge to home typically include a PADSS score &ge;9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A commonly used modification of the PADSS system is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F100381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100381 \">table 4</a>). Another example is the Aldrete score, which includes five elements (activity, respiration, circulation, consciousness, oxygen saturation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The Modified Aldrete system includes five additional elements that are particularly useful during the Phase II recovery period prior to discharge to home (dressing, pain, ambulation, feeding, urine output) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Additional considerations may be applicable for some inpatients.

Ideally, each patient should be assessed by an anesthesiologist prior to discharge, with documentation of any exceptions to standard discharge criteria. Fully trained nurses should be available to care for all postoperative patients until the time of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4207344440\"><span class=\"h2\">Fast-track discharge criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A &quot;fast track&quot; pathway for discharge from the PACU is appropriate for some ambulatory surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Patients who are &quot;fast-tracked&quot; bypass Phase I recovery and proceed directly from the operating room to Phase II recovery. The main benefits of this approach are shorter times to patient discharge and increased PACU productivity. Most fast-track protocols involve the use of preemptive analgesia and intraoperative use of short-acting anesthetic drugs and techniques. Careful patient selection is needed to ensure that a fast-track pathway does not increase risk of postoperative morbidity. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2440716335\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-ANESTHETIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) require that a post-anesthetic evaluation be completed and documented by a qualified anesthesia provider (eg, an anesthesiologist or a certified registered nurse anesthetist or anesthesiology assistant operating under the supervision of an anesthesiologist) no more than 48 hours after all surgeries or procedures requiring anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4198864902\" class=\"local\">'Initial handoff'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway patency, respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), the electrocardiogram (ECG), mental status, neuromuscular function, temperature, pain, and nausea or vomiting are assessed upon arrival in the PACU. After initial assessment, RR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, HR, and the ECG are monitored continuously, while the other parameters are assessed frequently. A record is maintained to document these assessments and medications administered during the PACU stay. (See <a href=\"#H1517658997\" class=\"local\">'Assessment, monitoring, and care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have received a neuraxial block, the degree of analgesic efficacy and gradual return of motor and sensory function are documented. Suspected complications of a neuraxial anesthetic, in particular spinal-epidural hematoma (SEH), may require urgent assessment and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H4275949016\" class=\"local\">'Assessment after neuraxial block'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2346585878\" class=\"local\">'Spinal epidural hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more postoperative problems occurs in nearly 25 percent of patients in the PACU, with postoperative nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting being the most common problem. (See <a href=\"#H1271068\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1324456782\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative nausea and vomiting'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory and cardiovascular complications are also common and should be promptly detected and treated.

Both hypothermia or hyperthermia have negative consequences in the immediate postoperative period and either may cause shivering <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thermal discomfort.

(See <a href=\"#H816154108\" class=\"local\">'Hypothermia or hyperthermia'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to void is common following anesthesia. Patients with risk factors for urinary retention should undergo assessment of urinary volume with bladder ultrasound to determine if one-time catheterization is needed prior to PACU discharge.
