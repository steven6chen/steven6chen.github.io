In many cases, this means that pain continues even after the injury or condition that first caused it has been treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30614073\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes chronic pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of chronic pain is not always clear. Sometimes it is caused by an ongoing medical problem, such as arthritis or diabetic neuropathy (a form of nerve damage from diabetes). But doctors cannot always find the cause of chronic pain.</p><p>In some cases, people with chronic pain must accept that their pain will never be explained. This does not mean that they have to accept their pain. It just means that they have to work with their healthcare team to address the pain, even if they don't know its cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30614088\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chronic pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom of chronic pain is, of course, pain. But the pain can affect the body in different ways. Some people have aches deep inside their muscle or bone. Some people have stabbing or shooting pain, often with tingling or numbness. And others have dull, throbbing pain.</p><p>People who have chronic pain might have a hard time doing their usual activities, such as bathing or dressing. This can lead to depression and anxiety, and it can cause problems with sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30614103\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you first start having pain, your doctor might do tests to figure out the cause. You might get:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for infection or signs of inflammation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays or other imaging tests to check for bone fractures, joint damage, cancer, or other changes in your body that could cause pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve tests to check whether the nerves are working normally</p><p/><p>However, tests cannot always show the cause of pain. Scientists think that in some people, the pain signals in the brain stop working normally. The signals get &quot;stuck&quot; in the on position, even when the source of pain is gone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30614118\"><span class=\"h1\">How is chronic pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for chronic pain include both medicines and activities. No single treatment works for everyone. Your doctor or nurse will help you find the right mix of treatments for you. Treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve pain, improve sleep, or improve mood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to learn exercises and stretches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Working with a counselor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections (shots) of numbing or pain-relieving medicines into the spine or area with pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acupuncture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices that affect nerve signals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p>To find the best treatment for you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be open to trying new treatments and combinations of treatments. Sometimes you have to try a few different options before you find one that works best.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Set realistic goals for your treatment. Even if you can't completely get rid of your pain, you might be able to control it enough so that you can do the things you want to do.</p><p/><p>If your doctor suggests a medicine that seems out of place, keep an open mind. Sometimes, doctors treat pain with medicines made to treat other medical problems. For example, doctors can use medicines for depression to treat pain because they work on areas of the brain that process pain. Doctors can also use medicines for seizures to treat pain, because they help with overactive nerves.</p><p>Keep in mind, too, that many people need a team to help manage their care. A treatment team usually includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doctors or specialists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physical therapist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Someone trained in mental health (such as a social worker or counselor)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30614133\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some things to try include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a heating pad or a cold pack on the painful area. Check with your doctor before trying this to make sure it is OK for your individual condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practice relaxing. You can learn methods to relax your body, such as doing deep breathing exercises. Ask your doctor or nurse about these methods. Relaxing the mind can help with how the body feels pain. People can learn to quiet their pain or make it less bothersome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay as active as possible. Walking, swimming, tai chi (a kind of martial art), or biking can all help ease muscle and joint pain. If you are not active, your pain might get worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly. Make small increases in the intensity and amount of time you spend exercising. If exercising increases your pain, talk with your doctor. He or she might recommend a program that can help you get more active.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you feel depressed, talk to your doctor or nurse about it. Chronic pain and depression often go together, and each can make the other worse. Getting treatment for your depression can make it easier to cope with your pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30614148\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternative-medicine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alternative medicine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fibromyalgia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neuropathic pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioids-for-short-term-treatment-of-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Opioids for short-term treatment of pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
