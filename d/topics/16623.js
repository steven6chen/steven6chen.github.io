Diffuse gastric cancer represents approximately 5 percent of all invasive gastric cancers. An inherited form of DGC, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) can be caused by mutations in the E-cadherin (<em>CDH1</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] or the alpha-E-catenin (<em>CTNNA1</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Since the lifetime risk of developing gastric cancer for <em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers from HDGC families is very high (70 percent for men and 56 percent for women), prophylactic total gastrectomy is often recommended for them at an early age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. </p><p>The surgical management of HDGC will be reviewed here. The genetics and pathogenesis of HDGC, as well as issues related to screening for HDGC and surveillance for breast and other cancers in <em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Diffuse type cancers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356068545\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR PROPHYLACTIC TOTAL GASTRECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients from a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) family who have tested positive for a pathogenic germline <em>CDH1</em> mutation, we recommend a prophylactic total gastrectomy to reduce the risk of developing invasive gastric cancer. For patients with a <em>CDH1</em> mutation but who are not from an HDGC family, we recommend individualized evaluation at an experienced center before prophylactic total gastrectomy is offered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356071554\"><span class=\"h2\">CDH1 mutation carriers from HDGC families</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic patients with a family history of HDGC and <em>CDH1</em> mutations have a high probability of developing signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach that cannot be diagnosed on endoscopy. When symptoms arise, the diagnosis can be made by endoscopy, but such patients may already have metastases and decreased survival. Thus, surveillance endoscopy is of limited value, and prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended for patients with family history of HDGC and <em>CDH1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The lifetime cumulative risk for clinically significant gastric cancer in individuals from these families is 70 percent for men (95% CI 59 to 80 percent) and 56 percent for women (95% CI 44 to 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients who develop symptoms have a poor prognosis, with only 10 percent having resectable diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and for those who undergo surgery with curative intent, the five-year survival rate does not exceed 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Given that there are no reliable screening tests that allow an early diagnosis of invasive gastric adenocarcinoma, prophylactic total gastrectomy and reconstruction are generally recommended for asymptomatic patients who have a pathogenic mutation of the <em>CDH1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. </p><p><em>CTNNA1</em> mutations may also result in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, confirmatory studies and penetrance data are lacking; therefore, it is unknown whether or not prophylactic gastrectomy should be performed in <em>CTNNA1</em> gene carriers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432842\"><span class=\"h2\">CDH1 mutation carriers not from HDGC families</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical genetic testing for cancer risk assessment using multigene panels has become widespread over the past decade. With the inclusion of <em>CDH1</em> on many multigene cancer panels, primarily because of its role as a high-penetrance breast cancer risk allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], individuals may be identified as having a <em>CDH1</em> mutation who do not have a personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer. These patients need to be evaluated individually by centers with experience before a prophylactic total gastrectomy can be offered, as the recommendations for prophylactic gastrectomy are based upon data generated from high-penetrant HDGC families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer#H438912698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Management of CDH1 mutation carriers without typical HDGC syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF PROPHYLACTIC TOTAL GASTRECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic gastrectomy is often advised between age 20 and 30. However, patients recommended for prophylactic gastrectomy may refuse or wish to postpone surgery. For patients who wish to delay prophylactic total gastrectomy, age, fertility considerations, family phenotypes (especially the age of onset of clinical cancer in probands), and preexisting nutritional disorders should also be taken into account. The estimated risk of neoplastic disease and the anticipated reduction in risk that is achieved through surgical intervention should be weighed against the negative outcomes of surgery, including complications associated with total gastrectomy and gastrointestinal reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356070220\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient age, especially at both extremes, should be a consideration in any discussion of prophylactic total gastrectomy. As with other inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes, the age at which a prophylactic procedure is recommended should be based upon the presence of a known pathogenic mutation and the age of onset of disease in the pedigree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The potential physical and psychological ramifications of a total gastrectomy should be balanced with the penetrance pattern of a particular kindred. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356071181\"><span class=\"h3\">Young patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic gastrectomy is often advised between age 20 and 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although the mean age of onset of diffuse gastric cancer documented in the literature is approximately 38, there are certain kindreds in which the mean age of onset is much younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Early prophylactic total gastrectomy may be justified in such kindreds due to the observation that disease tends to develop at a younger age in successive generations of affected individuals, a phenomenon referred to as genetic anticipation. Some suggest timing total gastrectomy in <em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers at an age that is five years younger than that of the youngest family member who developed gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>As more pedigrees are evaluated, young individuals and their families may want to discuss prophylactic surgery. We have recommended that gastrectomy be considered in the early 20s in male mutation carriers and that female mutation carriers should be advised of the possible dietary ramifications of prophylactic total gastrectomy on future fertility. (See <a href=\"#H356070338\" class=\"local\">'Women of childbearing age'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356071187\"><span class=\"h3\">Old patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients are less likely to benefit from a prophylactic gastrectomy than younger patients because of a shorter life expectancy and a higher perioperative risk. </p><p>Although the upper age limit for performing prophylactic gastrectomy is not well defined, patients who are older than 75 years should not undergo such a procedure, as their mortality from the procedure outweighs their mortality from gastric cancer. </p><p>Decisions about prophylactic gastrectomy in middle-aged and older patients who are younger than 75 years should be individualized based upon their comorbidities and the age of gastric cancer onset in their respective kindred. If the onset of disease in the family is early, older patients may live out their natural life expectancy without ever developing gastric cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433650\"><span class=\"h2\">Eating disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As patients can be expected to lose 10 to 15 percent of their body weight following total gastrectomy, those with eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa are at high risk of developing physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychological complications after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Thus, the potential risk of gastric cancer must be weighed against the severity of eating disorders before a prophylactic gastrectomy is carried out.</p><p>We do not perform total gastrectomy in patients who are frankly malnourished, actively losing weight, or who have a body mass index less than 18 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. In addition, for any patient with a known or suspected eating disorder, we pursue psychiatric assessment and close collaboration with an established multidisciplinary eating disorder treatment team to give the patient the best chance of achieving long-term healthy weight control. (See <a href=\"#H356069524\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional evaluation and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356070338\"><span class=\"h2\">Women of childbearing age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total gastrectomy is known to cause weight loss, and low body weight is a known risk factor for female infertility (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Low body weight'</a>). Nevertheless, gastric surgery does not preclude the ability to have future pregnancy. At least three pregnancies following prophylactic total gastrectomy have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. All three delivered normal infants at term. In addition, over 150 pregnancies after gastrectomy for various other indications have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p>Thus, for women of childbearing age, the risk of infertility must be balanced against the risk of developing a likely fatal cancer. For those women who become pregnant after gastric surgery, appropriate monitoring and supplementation for nutritional deficiencies are required to avoid maternal anemia and fetal malformation (eg, neural tube defects from folate deficiency).

HDGC should be suspected, prompting genetic testing of the patient and family members, in any case of diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in a patient under the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Specific criteria for genetic testing for <em>CDH1</em> mutations in patients with suspected HDGC are addressed elsewhere. Patients are only offered surgery when they test positive for one of the known pathogenic mutations in the <em>CDH1</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H356071554\" class=\"local\">'CDH1 mutation carriers from HDGC families'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Genetic counseling and testing'</a>.)</p><p>Female members of the kindred should be made aware that the risk for breast cancer is increased. Women with <em>CDH1</em> germline mutations have a 42 percent risk of developing lobular breast cancer by age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most guidelines suggest that mutation carriers be managed as are other women with high-risk inherited conditions such as <em>BRCA</em> mutations.

Micronutrients most commonly depleted after total gastrectomy include several water-soluble vitamins (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>), fat-soluble vitamins (eg, vitamins A, D, E, and K), and trace minerals, including iron and calcium.

Dietary and medical therapies are usually effective in dealing with most postgastrectomy syndromes. Surgical reintervention is rarely needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postgastrectomy-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postgastrectomy complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important for the patients to be aware that recovery from prophylactic total gastrectomy and return to a new &quot;normal&quot; eating pattern may take up to one year, during which time they are expected to lose 10 to 15 percent of their body weight. It is advisable that patients speak with others who have undergone this operation and who will be able to act as a source of support during recovery from the operation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110033098\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative imaging and endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative preparation for prophylactic total gastrectomy includes abdominal imaging, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy to ensure there is not an undiagnosed malignancy, as this would markedly change the operative approach.

Patients with a family history of HDGC who have biopsy-proven invasive gastric cancer should be managed according to guidelines set for regular, nonhereditary gastric cancer patients and undergo a therapeutic (as opposed to prophylactic) total gastrectomy with appropriate levels of lymph node dissection. The indications for and techniques of gastrectomy in patients with proven gastric cancer are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For all patients in whom total gastrectomy is anticipated, the gastroesophageal junction should be carefully examined by upper endoscopy, and any hiatal herniation should also be noted. A shortened esophagus will alter the surgical approach and may require extension of the incision into the thorax. If magnifying endoscopy methodology (eg, narrow band imaging, chromoendoscopy) is available, it can be used as a part of the endoscopic evaluation, but with the patient's knowledge that it is not a sensitive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Before gastrointestinal reconstruction, frozen section should be obtained of the proximal margin to confirm there is no residual gastric mucosa, which increases the risk for future malignancy. In a review of 29 prophylactic gastrectomies, three patients required reintervention due to incomplete removal of proximal gastric mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H356072238\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic total gastrectomy in otherwise asymptomatic patients may be an ideal situation for the laparoscopic approach, since perigastric lymph node harvest is not necessarily needed in the absence of invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Extent of lymph node dissection'</a> below).

Some surgeons do not perform a formal lymph node dissection, taking only those lymph nodes that are harvested during the course of gastric resection. This approach may be reasonable because the majority of these patients will have no more than pT1a cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a>), from which no lymph node metastases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, other surgeons advocate a D1 (perigastric) lymph node dissection with prophylactic gastrectomy just in case T1b or higher-stage disease is found on final pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Eighty-five percent of patients reported their quality of life to be as expected or better than expected when asked in long-term follow-up; a further 20 percent of patients reported that they had no expectations of a certain quality of life going into the procedure, leaving only 10 percent of patients reporting a worse quality of life than they had anticipated going into the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36588505\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WHO REFUSE SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients at risk for hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma who wish to delay prophylactic total gastrectomy, the only alternative is close endoscopic surveillance. The suggested endoscopic protocol, based on limited data, calls for annual white-light high-definition endoscopic examination with multiple (&gt;30) biopsies taken from representative areas of the antrum, transitional zone, body, fundus, and cardia of the stomach, evaluating for intramucosal signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/12,31,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31,44</a>]. However, patients must be fully educated about the shortcomings of this approach. The theoretical number of biopsies necessary to discover one focus of SRCC was estimated at 1768 (range 50 to 5832) at a 90 percent detection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Further, multiple mucosal biopsies have failed to identify SRCC that lies beneath an intact mucosal lining in many <em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers undergoing prophylactic total gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/5,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-9</a>].

Reasons for refusing surgery included fears over future childbearing, current physical health status, financial burden, and ability to deal with other life demands during convalescence. In that study, most patients who declined surgery would definitely consider it in the future. Given this information, we suggest periodically revisiting the option of surgery with patients who initially declined it, as they may reconsider when life circumstances permit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2237969247\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients who test positive for one of the pathogenic <em>CDH1</em> mutations, <strong>and</strong> who have a family history of HDGC, we recommend prophylactic total gastrectomy rather than endoscopic surveillance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The role of prophylactic gastrectomy for patients with a pathogenic <em>CDH1</em> mutation but <strong>no</strong> family history of HDGC is uncertain. Those patients should be evaluated and counseled individually at centers of experience. (See <a href=\"#H356068545\" class=\"local\">'Indications for prophylactic total gastrectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer#H438912698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Management of CDH1 mutation carriers without typical HDGC syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers with biopsy-proven cancer should be evaluated and treated in the same way as patients with nonhereditary gastric cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing of prophylactic total gastrectomy for patients at risk of developing HDGC is between age 20 and 30. However, a patient's age, fertility considerations, family phenotype (especially the age of onset of clinical cancer in probands), and preexisting nutritional disorders should also be taken into account when making a decision for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Timing of prophylactic total gastrectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging and endoscopy are carried out to exclude occult malignancy. Upper endoscopy is also used to assess the location of the gastroesophageal junction to determine the best surgical approach. (See <a href=\"#H110033098\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative imaging and endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During prophylactic total gastrectomy, the surgeon must ensure that the entire stomach is removed. The proximal (esophageal) margin must be checked by frozen section to ensure that it is free from any residual gastric tissue. (See <a href=\"#H433422\" class=\"local\">'Margins of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients undergoing prophylactic total gastrectomy, either no formal lymph node dissection, or a D1 (perigastric) lymph node dissection could be performed. We perform a conservative nodal sampling of perigastric nodes while preserving the omentum. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Extent of lymph node dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following total gastrectomy in patients undergoing prophylactic gastrectomy, gastrointestinal reconstruction is not standardized. Jejunal pouch reconstruction may provide quality-of-life benefits and is our preferred method of reconstruction following prophylactic total gastrectomy for HDGC.
