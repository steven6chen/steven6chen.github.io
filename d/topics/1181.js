Because of the difficulty in obtaining uncontaminated voided midstream urine specimens, quantitative thresholds have been established to distinguish bladder bacteriuria from urethral contamination. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as isolation of a specified quantitative count of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection. The quantitative thresholds are different for voided clean catch specimens and catheterized specimens.</p><p>The presence of pyuria (&ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">leukocytes/mm<sup>3</sup></span> of uncentrifuged urine) is not sufficient for diagnosis of bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of urine samples from asymptomatic elderly women; 60 percent of samples with pyuria had no bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Voided clean catch specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria for clean catch specimens including number of specimens and minimum quantitative bacteria counts are outlined for women and men below.

A bacterial count of &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> in a catheterized specimen was confirmed by a repeat catheterized specimen in &gt;95 percent of cases. On the other hand, &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> documented in an initial voided urine specimen was confirmed in a second voided specimen in 80 percent of cases. Two consecutive positive cultures predicted a third positive culture with 95 percent confidence. Therefore, two consecutive voided specimens were needed to predict bladder bacteriuria with the same degree of accuracy as a single urine specimen obtained through a catheter.</p><p>Other studies have used a more permissive definition of a single positive urine specimen with &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In general, external contamination during voiding among men is an extremely unlikely cause of significant bacteriuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are fewer data on microbiologic criteria for diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria in men.

In young healthy women, asymptomatic bacteriuria is transient; it rarely lasts longer than a few weeks.</p><p>Prevalence among diabetic women is 8 to 14 percent and is usually correlated with duration and presence of long term complications of diabetes, rather than with metabolic parameters of diabetes control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For example, attachment of bacteria via fimbrial adhesins is thought to be important for the establishment and persistence of symptomatic infection. Some bacterial strains with reduced capability for fimbriae expression appear to have the capacity for relatively rapid growth that thus allows them to cause asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, strains implicated in asymptomatic bacteriuria may be less virulent and therefore may not necessarily be true pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. For example, <em>Escherichia coli</em> strains recovered from spinal cord injury patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria demonstrate diminished capacity for red blood cell hemagglutination and hemolysis than strains implicated in symptomatic urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Even if they persist, such strains are unlikely to progress to serious infection. Based on this notion, some investigators have suggested that colonization with &quot;uroprotective&quot; strains of <em>E. coli</em> may be protective against infection with more invasive uropathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

A study of children with asymptomatic bacteriuria demonstrated lower levels of neutrophil Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression compared to age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In mice, TLR4 controls the mucosal response to <em>E. coli</em> and inactivation of TLR4 can lead to a carrier state that resembles asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In a meta-analysis of nine trials that included women and men from outpatient, geriatric, and nursing home settings, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic UTI (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.51-2.43), complications (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.35-1.74), or death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.70-1.41) compared with no treatment or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, antibiotics did increase the incidence of any adverse event. Avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is also important for reducing development of antibiotic resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The following sections discuss the data supporting not treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in the following populations: nonpregnant premenopausal women, men, diabetic patients, the elderly, or patients with spinal cord injury or indwelling urethral catheters, and patients undergoing joint arthroplasty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpregnant premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no role for screening for or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in premenopausal, nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/4,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,32,33</a>]. Although women with asymptomatic bacteriuria are at increased risk for symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], treatment does not reduce the frequency of symptomatic infection or recurrent asymptomatic bacteriuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/12,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,32</a>]. Although antibiotics initially sterilize the urine in almost all patients, bacteriuria recurs in approximately one-half by one year such that the prevalence is similar to that in untreated women at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, asymptomatic bacteriuria is not associated with long-term adverse outcomes such as chronic kidney disease or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/12,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,34</a>]. </p><p>In fact, in healthy premenopausal, nonpregnant women who experience frequent recurrent symptomatic UTIs, antibiotic therapy for episodes of asymptomatic bacteriuria not only is unnecessary but may also be harmful. In a trial of such women who were found to have asymptomatic bacteriuria with a uropathogen, a greater proportion of the participants randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for the bacteriuria experienced a subsequent symptomatic UTI over the following year compared with the women who did not receive antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Interpretation of these results may be limited by the lack of blinding and a placebo control, the unexpected pathogen profile, with <em>E. coli</em> accounting for only a third of cases, and the unusually low rate of study dropout in either group. Nevertheless, if these findings are confirmed by additional studies, they support the concept that asymptomatic bacterial colonization can protect against superinfection with more virulent strains and should not be treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Even women on immunosuppressive agents do not appear to be at greater risk of adverse outcomes from untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria. In a study of 260 women with rheumatologic disease, of whom 94 percent were taking an immunosuppressive agent, asymptomatic bacteriuria was identified in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. After a median of 12 months of follow-up, the rates of symptomatic UTI among those with and without asymptomatic bacteriuria at baseline were not statistically different (17 versus 12 percent), and no woman with asymptomatic bacteriuria developed sepsis or pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14186984\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, men should not be screened for <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated for asymptomatic bacteriuria. However, there are a few circumstances in which screening may be reasonable. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is warranted prior to transurethral resection of the prostate or other urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated because of the risk of post-procedure bacteremia and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the United States&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2424798\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients undergoing joint arthroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal approach to the evaluation of asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to hip or knee arthroplasty is uncertain, and there are no data from large trials to inform this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Given the lack of a clear association between joint infections and bacteriuria in multiple studies and the difference in the typical pathogen profiles of these infections, we favor not routinely performing urinalysis or culture in patients without urinary symptoms prior to or following joint arthroplasty. If a patient is found to have perioperative bacteriuria in the confirmed absence of urinary symptoms, we favor not treating with antibiotics for the same reasons.</p><p>Most observational studies do not demonstrate a clear association between perioperative bacteriuria and subsequent development of prosthetic joint infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. In a prospective, multicenter study of nearly 2500 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, screening identified asymptomatic bacteriuria (&ge;10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in the absence of signs or symptoms of UTI) in 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In the year following surgery, there were 43 prosthetic joint infections (1.7 percent). Although patients with preoperative asymptomatic bacteriuria were more likely to have a prosthetic joint infection than those without (4.3 versus 1.4 percent infection rate, odds ratio 3.23, 95% CI 1.67-6.27), treatment of the bacteriuria, which was at the discretion of the clinician, was not associated with a decreased risk of infection. Moreover, the organisms isolated from the urine were not the same as those from the surgical site infection in any patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria. These results complement those of other large observational studies that did not demonstrate an association between bacteriuria or symptomatic UTI and prosthetic joint infection and also noted that organisms isolated from the urine are not the same as those causing surgical site infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>]. Other small studies evaluating patients with asymptomatic preoperative bacteriuria who proceeded to surgery (with preoperative or postoperative antibiotic therapy) failed to find any instances of subsequent joint infections attributable to the urinary pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. </p><p>Other studies have suggested an association between postoperative UTI and prosthetic joint infections, but these are mainly limited to small case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. In one large retrospective study, post-arthroplasty UTI was independently associated with a subsequent surgical site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, the criteria for UTI diagnosis used in the study were not specified, and there was no evaluation of a microbiological link between the uropathogens and those causing the joint infections. </p><p>Some experts have advocated screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients undergoing joint arthroplasty because of the biological plausibility of subsequent surgical site infection and the relative ease of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. We believe that further data are warranted before such a recommendation can be made. The very low infection risk of total joint arthroplasty, the disparity of flora between bacteriuria and surgical site infection, and the delays as well as the small but real risks related to screening and treating bacteriuria do not support universal screening. </p><p>In contrast, evaluation and treatment is indicated in pre- and postoperative patients who have symptomatic UTI.
