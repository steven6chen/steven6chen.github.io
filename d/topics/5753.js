Normally, ear wax helps to protect the insides of the ears and prevents injury or infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74771 \">figure 1</a>). But having too much ear wax can cause symptoms such as pain and trouble hearing. The medical term for ear wax is &quot;cerumen.&quot;</p><p>Young children and older adults are more likely than others to have ear wax impaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9686275\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes ear wax impaction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different things can cause ear wax impaction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that affect the ear &ndash; Some health problems can affect the shape of the inside of the ear, and make it hard for wax to move out. For example, skin problems that cause skin cells to shed a lot can lead to wax build-up in the ears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A narrow ear canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 2</a>) &ndash; In some people, the ear canals are narrower than in others. These people might be more likely to have ear wax impaction. A person's ear canal can become narrower after an ear injury or after severe or multiple ear infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in ear wax and lining due to aging &ndash; As people get older, their ear wax gets harder and thicker. This makes it difficult for the wax to move out of the ear as it should.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad ear-cleaning habits &ndash; Some people try to clean their ears using cotton swabs (Q-Tips) or other tools. This can actually push the wax deeper into the ear instead of getting it out. Over time, this can cause ear wax impaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making too much ear wax &ndash; Some people make more ear wax than others. This can happen when water gets trapped in the ear, or when the ear is injured. But some people have a lot of ear wax for no obvious reason.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9686290\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of ear wax impaction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing a ringing noise in the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like the ear is blocked or plugged</p><p/><p>These symptoms can happen in one or both ears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9686305\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you or your child has any of these symptoms, see a doctor or nurse. He or she can check the insides of the ears to figure out if the symptoms are caused by ear wax impaction or another problem, such as an ear infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9686320\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I clean my (or my child's) ears at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. The insides of the ears do not usually need to be cleaned. Sticking things into the ears can push the wax in deeper and cause impaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9686335\"><span class=\"h1\">How is ear wax impaction treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several treatments to remove impacted ear wax. Doctors and nurses offer these treatments only to people who have bothersome symptoms. They do not recommend treatments for removing ear wax in people who have no symptoms, even if their ears are impacted.</p><p>In some cases, doctors and nurses will remove ear wax in people whose ears are impacted and who aren't able to let others know if they have symptoms or not. This can include young children, and people who are confused or have trouble speaking, including some older adults.</p><p>There are several different ways to remove ear wax:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear drops &ndash; Special ear drops can soften ear wax and help it to drain out. Ear drops are <strong>not</strong> usually safe for people with an ear infection or damage to the eardrum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinsing &ndash; In some cases, a doctor or nurse can remove impacted ear wax by squirting water (or a special liquid) into the ear to rinse it out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special tools &ndash; A doctor or nurse might use a special tool to remove ear wax. There are different types of tools that can do this safely. These include small sticks, hooks, and spoons. There are also tools that use suction to pull the wax out.</p><p/><p>&quot;Ear candling&quot; involves lighting one end of a hollow candle, and putting the other end in the ear. Ear candling is <strong>not</strong> recommended for ear wax removal. It does not work well and can cause injuries or burns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9686350\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=outer-ear-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Outer ear infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-hearing-loss-presbycusis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-including-swimmers-ear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
