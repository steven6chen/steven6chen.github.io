Over the past two decades propofol has also been used extensively for procedural sedation in sedation units, emergency departments and radiology suites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. The decision to use propofol and whether it is used with other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>) should depend on the duration and the nature of the procedure being performed. </p><p>Practitioners who choose to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> alone or in combination with other medications for brief procedural sedation outside of the operating room must vigilantly adhere to protocols that include careful monitoring with capnography as well as pulse oximetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Use must be consistent with hospital guidelines and protocols, local regulations, and the practitioner's privilege delineation. In some regions, propofol is <strong>only</strong> approved for use by anesthesiologists or others with specialized pediatric procedural sedation training. Otherwise, propofol use for sedation in children may be considered unapproved. Clinicians should check local recommendations. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing and administration</strong> &ndash; When used for prolonged sedation (eg, during magnetic resonance imaging), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> is often given as a continuous infusion. Although the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended starting dose is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute, a typical effective starting dose of 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute is frequently used by experienced practitioners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. The infusion dose is then gradually increased as needed to achieve adequate sedation up to a maximum dose of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For brief procedures, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> may also be administered as a continuous infusion or as an initial intravenous (IV) bolus dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in infants and children between six months and two years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When propofol is combined with other agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a>), the initial bolus dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is suggested. Repeated doses of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of IV propofol may be given every three to five minutes up to a maximum total dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> as needed to achieve the desired effect. Relative to a continuous infusion, bolus dosing of propofol increases the risk of exceeding the desired level of sedation and is associated with a higher likelihood of respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially when combined with opioid medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypovolemic patients should receive intravenous fluids to correct volume status prior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> sedation. For children with reduced cardiac output, attempts should be made to improve cardiac performance prior to sedation and dosing should be minimized. In these patients, propofol sedation should only be provided by clinicians with significant experience sedating children with heart disease </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propofol</a> causes pain during IV administration that can be reduced by IV pretreatment with 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> injected into the vein with a tourniquet applied for one minute or by administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> or an opioid prior to propofol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pain is also lessened by injecting into an antecubital rather than a hand vein. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benefits</strong> &ndash; Compared to other commonly used agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> has the fastest onset of action and one of the shortest recovery times (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83512 \">table 1</a>). Propofol reduces intracranial pressure, making it a good choice in hemodynamically stable patients with head trauma. Studies indicate high efficacy for successful completion of diagnostic imaging and, when combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>, a variety of painful procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adverse effects</strong> &ndash; Because of the rapid onset of action and high potency of the drug, it can rapidly achieve a greater depth of sedation than intended, including general anesthesia, especially when given in bolus doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adverse effects requiring routine intervention by appropriately trained providers occur in approximately 2 to 5 percent of children undergoing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> sedation and include respiratory depression, apnea, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6,11,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,18-20</a>]. Respiratory arrest requiring endotracheal intubation, pulmonary aspiration, and cardiorespiratory arrest have all been described but occur rarely when sedation is performed by well-trained physicians as part of an organized sedation service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a systematic review of 20 trials and 40 observational studies of approximately 17,000 children undergoing sedation outside of the operating room, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> was associated with the following adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory events</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Apnea &ndash; 2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Laryngospasm &ndash; 0.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Oxygen desaturation &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Unplanned intubation 0.02 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotension &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bradycardia &ndash; 0.1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a separate study of almost 50,000 pediatric sedations outside of the operating room, rates of adverse events for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> per 10,000 sedations were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Airway obstruction &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">432/10,000</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oxygen desaturation (&lt;90 percent for &gt;30 seconds) &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">154/10,000</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Change in heart rate, blood pressure, or respiratory rate &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">61/10,000</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apnea &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">31/10,000</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laryngospasm &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">21/10,000</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">This study also documented four cases of aspiration and two cardiac arrests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although evidence is limited, the addition of an opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> sedation appears to increase the risk of respiratory events. As an example, in a trial that included 59 children undergoing fracture reduction with propofol and fentanyl, oxygen desaturation occurred and requirement for respiratory maneuvers were reported in 31 percent and 25 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraindications and precautions</strong> &ndash; Formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> contain egg lecithin, egg yolk phospholipids, and soybean oil.

Unlike most sedatives, it causes minimal respiratory depression. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dexmedetomidine for sedation of adults prior to or during surgical or other procedures. As a relatively new agent for pediatric procedural sedation, the experience with the drug is still limited, and its scope of use is evolving. In healthy children, dexmedetomidine has been found to be generally safe and effective for nonpainful procedures (eg, neuroimaging) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].
