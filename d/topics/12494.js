It may consist of alternating phases of a slow drift in one direction with a corrective quick &quot;jerk&quot; in the opposite direction, or of slow, sinusoidal, &quot;pendular&quot; oscillations to and fro. Jerk nystagmus is more common than pendular nystagmus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jerk-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jerk nystagmus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pendular-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pendular nystagmus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nystagmus can be continuous or paroxysmal, or evoked by certain maneuvers such as specific gaze or head positions. Nystagmus associated with some pathologies may only be seen transiently with hyperventilation or coughing and sneezing.</p><p>An overview of nystagmus, its treatment, and the vestibular physiology relevant to nystagmus and vertigo is presented here. The approach to vertigo is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF NYSTAGMUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major types of nystagmus are jerk nystagmus and pendular nystagmus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Jerk nystagmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jerk nystagmus is subdivided by trajectory and the conditions under which it occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72446\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72446 \">table 1</a>). Some forms are always present, even when the eyes are in the primary position. Nystagmus in the primary position is classified according to trajectory:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>downbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>upbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>horizontal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>torsional</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>mixed</p><p/><p>The direction named is the direction of the fast phase.</p><p>Other forms emerge only under specific conditions such as peripheral gaze (gaze-evoked) and certain head positions (positional). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jerk-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jerk nystagmus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most acquired jerk nystagmus are the result of an asymmetry in vestibular inputs, in either the central or peripheral nervous system. Understanding the diagnostic value of the trajectory of jerk nystagmus requires some knowledge of the physiology of the semicircular canals (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pendular nystagmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pendular nystagmus has a sinusoidal oscillation without fast phases. The waveform of pendular nystagmus may occur in any direction; it can be torsional, horizontal, vertical, or a combination of these, resulting in circular, oblique, or elliptical trajectories. It can be different in the two eyes, sometimes even monocular. A video demonstrating pendular nystagmus is available at <a href=\"http://www.neuroophthalmology.ca/case-of-the-month/eye-movements/monocular-blurry-vision-in-multiple-sclerosis&amp;token=AzLga2FCMn8uYY/ydj+QZo+fb21YySLQxuwEZFX9u2JIpw+bqh6U+3VxOSD340Ud2ab7WPU89YhNsKcWWVJz4zbswONua/HZi5X3rb7iblBlobMOKISGJIFc0GAvjYFe&amp;TOPIC_ID=5109\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.neuroophthalmology.ca/case-of-the-month/eye-movements/monocular-blurry-vision-in-multiple-sclerosis</a>. </p><p>The diagnosis of pendular nystagmus is an exercise in pattern recognition, since pendular nystagmus is subdivided into a number of types recognized mainly by very specific trajectories. These are described in detail separately.

These slabs have a significant amount of inertia. Any linear acceleration of the head (eg, gravity) causes the head to move relative to the otoconia, resulting in a bending of the hair cells and a change in neuronal activity.</p><p>The semicircular canals detect angular accelerations (turns, or rotations) of the head. Each canal contains fluid and a gelatinous structure called the ampulla, in which hair cells are embedded. Rotation of the head causes the canal to move relative to the fluid within it, thereby generating a force against the ampulla that bends the hair cells. An increase or decrease from the baseline firing rate occurs depending upon the direction of rotation.</p><p>There are six canals arranged along three cardinal planes on each side. The two horizontal canals lie in one plane, not quite horizontal but tilted downward 30 degrees. The vertical (anterior and posterior) canals are all at approximately right angles to the horizontal plane, but positioned in two planes 45 degrees from the sagittal plane. Thus, each plane has a pair of canals, the anterior canal of one side paired with the posterior canal of the other side.</p><p>The vestibular system uses these pairs of canals in a &quot;push-pull&quot; reciprocal fashion. An angular movement of the head along one of these planes will maximally activate one canal and maximally inhibit its counterpart. Thus, the normal resting firing rate of the nerve from one canal increases while that of its counterpart decreases. The net change in both directions is summed algebraically by the brain to reveal the change in head position. This information is transmitted to the ocular motor nuclei, causing the eyes to move smoothly an equal and opposite amount to the head turn (the vestibuloocular reflex), enabling the eyes to remain stationary in space despite the head movement.</p><p>The directions that excite each canal are given by a simple rule: &quot;a canal is excited by head motion towards the canal, in the appropriate plane.&quot; Thus, the right horizontal canal is excited by right head <strong>turns</strong>, the right posterior canal is excited by right head <strong>tilts</strong> or &quot;posterior&quot; head tilts (neck extension), and the left anterior canal is excited by left head tilts or &quot;anterior&quot; head tilts (neck flexion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vestibuloocular responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vestibuloocular reflex keeps the line of sight stable in space while the head is moving. Thus, it uses information about head rotation to drive the eyes an equal amount in the opposite direction. To accomplish this, each semicircular canal has excitatory projections to a pair of extraocular muscles, one in each eye, and inhibitory projections to an antagonistic pair. The muscles maximally activated by a canal are approximately aligned with the plane of that canal.</p><p>To understand the effects of such activation requires knowledge of the direction of pull of each extraocular muscle. The horizontal recti are simple: the lateral recti abduct and the medial recti adduct the eye. The vertical recti and obliques are more complex: they all have primary, secondary, and tertiary actions upon the globe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71408\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71408 \">table 2</a>). It is useful to think of the line of pull of these muscles as approximately aligned with the planes of the vertical semicircular canals. While the line of pull remains roughly constant, the effect of the pull upon the eye in part depends upon whether the eye is abducted or adducted at the time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction of the superior rectus elevates the eye, especially when it is in the abducted position. When the eye is adducted, however, this strong primary action of the muscle is less and there is also more of an intorsional motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction of the inferior rectus leads to the opposite pattern: depression of the eye in abduction with some extorsion in adduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction of the superior oblique causes mainly intorsion of the eye, as it pulls the top of the eye towards the pulley at the anteromedial corner of the roof of the orbit. This is maximal in abduction. When the eye is adducted, however, the pull of the top of the eye toward the pulley now causes depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction of the inferior oblique, whose origin is at the anteromedial corner of the floor of the orbit, leads to the opposite pattern, extorsion of the eye in abduction, with elevation in adduction.</p><p/><p>With these data it is easy to see which pair of muscles is activated (or inhibited) by each semicircular canal to keep the line of sight steady with head turns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61830 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Generation of nystagmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the planes of action and ocular activations of the semicircular canals and their push-pull relationship with opposing canals on the other side is essential to understanding how jerk nystagmus is generated. With a lesion of the right horizontal canal, for example, there is a loss of tonic leftward vestibular input since there is always a baseline level of activity. The unopposed rightward &quot;push&quot; from the intact left horizontal canal creates a slow rightward drift of the eyes, the &quot;slow phase,&quot; which is eventually counteracted by a leftward fast phase. Thus, loss of the right horizontal canal creates left-beating nystagmus.</p><p>Similarly, loss of the right anterior canal creates a nystagmus that is a mix of upbeat and counterclockwise torsional fast phases, and loss of the right posterior canal creates a <span class=\"nowrap\">downbeat/counterclockwise</span> torsional nystagmus. If all three canals on the right side are lost, the upbeat and downbeat components cancel each other out, but the counterclockwise torsional effect add together and summate with the left-beating horizontal nystagmus to create a mixed horizontal-torsional nystagmus. This is the typical finding with &quot;peripheral nystagmus,&quot; that is, nystagmus from acute unilateral damage to the labyrinth or vestibular nerve.</p><p>This also explains why pure vertical nystagmus is rarely if ever generated by peripheral vestibular disease. To obtain pure downbeat nystagmus, a lesion would have to affect the two posterior canals, summating the resulting loss of upward slow drifts, canceling the opposing torsional drifts, and sparing all other canals. The odds are against such a selective yet bilateral lesion of the labyrinth. The same holds for pure upbeat nystagmus. On the other hand, the central vestibular pathways in the brainstem are organized so that such deficits are possible.</p><p>Pure torsional nystagmus conceivably could result from a lesion that affected both the anterior and posterior canal on one side, sparing the horizontal canal. However, the regional blood supply and nerve subdivisions of the labyrinth segregate the anterior canal and horizontal canal from the posterior canal. Clinical studies suggest that vestibular neuronitis, for example, is a partial defect whose nystagmus suggests either a combination of horizontal and anterior canal dysfunction, or almost pure horizontal canal loss. Thus, partial lesions of the periphery are unlikely to cause pure torsional nystagmus. Pure horizontal nystagmus, however, could be either central or peripheral.</p><p>Some nystagmus is the result of hyperfunction of a canal rather than hypofunction of one labyrinth. The classic example is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Movement of debris in the posterior canal leads to abnormal activation, generating slow downward and torsional drifts, and therefore a mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">upbeat/torsional</span> nystagmus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertigo is the primary symptom associated with nystagmus and is most prominent with acute unilateral peripheral vestibular disease. Other symptoms associated with nystagmus include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oscillopsia &mdash; Oscillopsia is a to-and-fro illusion of environmental motion. Depending upon the nystagmus, this may be continuous, intermittent, or gaze-evoked. This contrasts with the oscillopsia from bilateral vestibular hypofunction, which only occurs when the head is moving, as when walking or riding in a car.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurred vision &mdash; Blurred vision occurs because the retinal image is smeared by stimulus motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal head positions &mdash; Patients who find that their oscillopsia or blurred vision is least troublesome in certain gaze positions that minimize nystagmus may assume abnormal head positions.</p><p/><p>Some patients with nystagmus are asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rhythmic nature and slow speeds of nystagmus distinguish it from a number of other abnormal involuntary eye movements.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saccadic intrusions are irregular bursts of rapid eye movements, almost always indicating a problem of the midline cerebellum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults#H17305672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cerebellar ataxia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical and anatomic correlations'</a>.) <br/><br/>These movements include opsoclonus, ocular flutter, square wave jerks, and macrosaccadic oscillations. Voluntary nystagmus is a misnomer; it too is a type of saccadic intrusion, which most resembles ocular flutter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular bobbing and its variants have slow drifts and fast phases but are much more irregular than nystagmus. They occur in comatose and locked-in individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Eye movements'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locked-in-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locked-in syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oculogyric crises are irregular prolonged deviations of the eyes, usually up and lateral, that lack rhythmicity and slow phases. They are most frequently encountered with phenothiazine intoxication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of dystonia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMATIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to nystagmus therapy involves three basic considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the type of nystagmus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there treatable underlying causes?

Patients without these symptoms do not require symptomatic treatment.</p><p>There are four main types of symptomatic nystagmus therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin injections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prism lenses and optical solutions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate medication use depends upon the type of nystagmus. This is discussed separately in individual topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pendular-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pendular nystagmus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jerk-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jerk nystagmus&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Botulinum injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Botulinum injections into muscle or the intraconal space have been used to weaken the extraocular muscles and diminish the amplitude of nystagmus. These improve vision, oscillopsia, and nystagmus somewhat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], but they also weaken normal eye movements. In some reports the most telling detail is that patients have declined to repeat the experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Prism lenses and optical solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prism lenses and optical solutions may be useful in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If patients have a position of gaze in which nystagmus is minimal, prisms can be used so that the eyes are in this &quot;null position&quot; when the patient is trying to look directly ahead. Oscillopsia is thereby minimized for this most frequent gaze position, but gaze to the side will still bring on symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If convergence dampens nystagmus, the patient can wear prisms that make the eyes more convergent while fixating in the distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High hyperopic glasses can be combined with high myopic contact lenses to create a situation in which the retinal image does not shift with eye movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This is useful for reading, but the field of view narrows to a tunnel, and the desirable effects of normal eye movements are impaired in that they do not shift or steady gaze normally. Thus, the system cannot be worn while walking around. Most patients find the device cumbersome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact lenses can dampen congenital nystagmus for unknown reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgery tries to shift the attachment of the muscles so that the muscle tensions appropriate to a gaze position where nystagmus was minimal or absent now place the eyes in center gaze. In essence, this is similar to the strategy of prism therapy and, as with prisms, oscillopsia will still be present in lateral gaze. Surgery has been used mainly with congenital nystagmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], where it has been reported to improve visual acuity in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Four-muscle tenotomy and reattachment is not aimed at shifting the null point, but at reducing proprioceptive feedback to an ocular motor control loop: it has been reported to broaden the null point and improve visual acuity in congenital nystagmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nystagmus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7761320\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nystagmus is a rhythmic regular oscillation of the eyes.
