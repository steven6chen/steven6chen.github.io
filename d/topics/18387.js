The ACE inhibitor is usually initiated prior to beta blocker therapy, with titration to a moderate dose. The beta blocker is then titrated to the maximum dose, followed by uptitration of the ACE inhibitor to the maximum recommended and tolerated dose. The approach to pharmacologic therapy of HFrEF is discussed in detail elsewhere.

In the screening phase of the SOLVD trial, for example, a test dose of 2.5 mg of enalapril twice daily produced symptomatic hypotension in 2.2 percent of almost 7500 patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV HF; cessation of therapy for hypotension was required in only 0.5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>If initial therapy is tolerated, the dose is then gradually increased (after maximization of beta blockers) to a maintenance dose of 10 mg twice daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a>, 50 mg three times daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>, or up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinapril</a> unless side effects occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1-3,5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,25</a>].

One suggestion is to check serum electrolytes and renal function at one week and at one month following increases in ACE inhibitor dose and then periodically (eg, every three to six months), depending on the patient's stability and baseline renal function. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3463359001\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of ACE inhibitors include hypotension, worsening renal function (discussed below), hyperkalemia, cough, and angioedema.

Worsening renal function as evidenced by increases in serum creatinine is observed in approximately 10 to 35 percent of patients with HFrEF after initiation of an ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The major mechanism is a preferential reduction in resistance at the efferent glomerular arteriole, which will lower the intraglomerular pressure that is the primary driving force to glomerular filtration. However, some patients have no change in serum creatinine, and approximately 10 to 25 percent have a reduction in serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

In another report, in which 34 of 104 HF patients developed a decline in GFR on ACE inhibitor therapy, the serum creatinine returned to pretreatment values with a reduction in diuretic dose and liberalization of salt intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
