EGPA is classified as a vasculitis of the small and medium sized arteries, although the vasculitis is often not apparent in the initial phases of the disease.</p><p>The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. EGPA, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with EGPA.</p><p>The diagnosis of EGPA is typically suspected based on the clinical findings (ie, eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1500/microL,</span> asthma, and allergic rhinitis). A positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test is present in 40 to 60 percent, but is neither sensitive nor specific. The diagnosis is generally confirmed by a biopsy of an affected tissue, such as lung, skin, or peripheral nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76251 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of EGPA will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING VASCULITIS SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two scoring systems have been developed to assess vasculitis disease activity in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss) and other vasculitides: the &quot;five-factor score&quot; (FFS) and the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS). These scoring systems are used to guide initial therapy.</p><p>The FFS, initially devised in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], was revised in 2011 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50118\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50118 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &gt;65</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac insufficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal involvement </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal insufficiency (stabilized peak plasma creatinine concentration &gt;1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1450 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) manifestations (presence is associated with a better prognosis) </p><p/><p>The presence of each factor is given one point. The FFS score ranges from 0 to 2: a score of 0 is given when none of the factors are present, a score of 1 for one factor, and a score of 2 for two or more factors. This scoring system has also been correlated with prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The BVAS is a research tool that is seldom used in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It has largely been applied to patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and microscopic polyangiitis, but has also been used in EGPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. The score includes both general symptoms (arthralgia, arthritis, and fever) and involvement of eight major organ systems (skin, mucous membranes, <span class=\"nowrap\">ear/nose/throat,</span> cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, nervous system) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At each site, persistent symptoms or manifestations (eg, sensorineural deafness, pulmonary nodule, alveolar hemorrhage) are given one point and new or worse symptoms are given two points. The score ranges from 0 (complete remission) to a maximum of 68. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Assessment of disease activity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATING THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary therapy for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss) is systemic glucocorticoids. An additional immunosuppressive agent is typically added in patients with more advanced or refractory disease and in those whose disease flares with tapering of systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Choosing among these agents is largely dependent on the disease severity and response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Assessing vasculitis severity'</a> above.)</p><p>Asthma is additionally managed according to current guidelines, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of severe asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Adjusting controller therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Hypertension should be managed in a standard fashion, but is sometimes difficult to control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>].

For patients with evidence of systemic vasculitis, treatment is initiated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or the equivalent) at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The higher dose is used for patients with more severe vasculitis (eg, impending respiratory failure, cardiac involvement, glomerulonephritis, neuropathy). With acute multiorgan disease, intravenous glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 g daily for three days) is used for initial therapy, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy as noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with EGPA achieve a remission with glucocorticoid therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of 72 patients without poor-prognosis factors (ie, no cardiac, renal, or central nervous system involvement) followed for five years or longer, 93 percent achieved a remission with glucocorticoid therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, patients with involvement of the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, or central nervous system will usually require additional immunosuppressive therapy as described below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cyclophosphamide'</a> below.)</p><p>Once disease manifestations have come under control, the glucocorticoid dose is gradually tapered over approximately 12 to 18 months, as tolerated. A portion of patients will need long-term low dose oral glucocorticoid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or less). In the study of 72 patients described above, almost 80 percent of those who achieved a remission required long-term low-dose glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In EGPA, late relapses of systemic vasculitis after a successful response to treatment are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The decision to add cyclophosphamide is based on the severity of disease in terms of number of organ systems involved and degree of impairment.

In addition, in a series of patients with a FFS of 1, a lower mortality was noted among those who were treated with cyclophosphamide compared with a separate group in which only some of the patients received cyclophosphamide (7 versus 26 percent mortality, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative regimen for patients with an FFS of 1, but milder, nonorgan-threatening disease, would be initial treatment with glucocorticoids plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>]. The use of an alternative induction regimen was evaluated in a study of 100 patients with early systemic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitides (including EGPA) that compared glucocorticoids plus methotrexate with glucocorticoids plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-eosinophilic-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-churg-strauss/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Insufficient data are available for EGPA to make a clear recommendation regarding this choice. Extrapolating from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), outcomes with daily and monthly regimens were similar; a slightly greater risk of bladder toxicity with the daily regimen and a slightly greater risk of relapse with the monthly regimen have been noted.

When used to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis, typically a six month regimen is used.
