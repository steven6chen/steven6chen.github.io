Individuals with these lesions require individualized assessment by an expert in adult congenital heart disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete heart block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete heart block can be congenital or acquired. The congenital form, sometimes called the neonatal lupus syndrome, is presumed to result from trans-placental passage of maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-La/SSB</span> antibodies. Approximately 50 percent of patients with congenital complete heart block are female and anticipate survival into childbearing age. Asymptomatic young women with congenital complete heart block and no pacemaker generally experience uneventful pregnancies, provided that the QRS duration is not prolonged (ie, the escape rhythm is junctional and not infranodal) and ventricular function is normal, which is usually the case. However, syncopal episodes occasionally first occur during gestation and the heart and circulation may not respond adequately to the acute circulatory demands of labor and delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Ebstein's anomaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to pregnancy in women with Ebstein's anomaly are discussed separately.

The double discordance &quot;corrects&quot; the circulation because systemic venous blood moves from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery, but via a morphologic left ventricle; pulmonary venous blood moves from the left atrium to the aorta via a morphologic right ventricle. The long-term functional durability of a morphologic right ventricle in the subaortic systemic location is problematic, and high-degree heart block occurs at a rate of approximately 2 percent per year. Clinical manifestations and disease course are heterogeneous. Nearly all patients with L-TGA have associated anomalies such as systemic atrioventricular valve abnormality in 90 percent, VSD in most, and pulmonic stenosis (often subvalvular) in 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The vulnerability of the morphologic subaortic right ventricle to hemodynamic overload, atrioventricular valve regurgitation, the development of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and the risk of heart block make pregnancy problematic. However, a literature review of studies published between 1985 and 2007 found the following complication rates during completed pregnancies (&gt;20 weeks gestation) among women with L-TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With respect to the mother, arrhythmias occurred in 3 of 84 pregnancies, heart failure in 6 of 84 pregnancies, and cardiovascular events in 2 of 84 pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With respect to the fetus, preterm delivery occurred in 7 of 78 pregnancies, fetal mortality in 1 of 78 pregnancies, perinatal mortality in 0 of 78 pregnancies, and recurrent congenital heart disease (of any type) in 1 of 28 pregnancies.</p><p/><p>Data are not yet available regarding the degree of RV dysfunction that imposes a higher pregnancy risk in this patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">D-Transposition of the great arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with complete transposition of the great arteries are reaching reproductive age because of operative intervention initially involving atrial switch repairs, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Gestational risks after Mustard or Senning repairs are related chiefly to the functional status of the subaortic morphologic right ventricle, to the level of pulmonary arterial pressure, and to conduction and rhythm abnormalities.</p><p>Since 1982, the arterial switch operation (Jatene) has been used increasingly to repair D-TGA in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

Thirty-eight percent of the babies were born premature and 38 percent were small for gestational age. A review of this and other observational data suggested that the hemodynamic stress of pregnancy may have adverse late effects on the heart, including worsening functional class and atrioventricular valve regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study examined cardiac events during 17 pregnancies in nine women who had undergone an arterial switch operation; six women had clinically important valve or ventricular lesions before the index pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In the majority of cases, the ventricular compartment has features of a morphologic left ventricle, and incorporates at its base a rudimentary outlet chamber that gives rise to the aorta, whereas the pulmonary trunk originates from the main ventricular compartment. Unrepaired adult patients may have anatomy unsuitable for palliation, or were not felt to be repairable in childhood. </p><p>Patients who reach adulthood have either pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary vascular disease that permits adequate, but not excessive pulmonary blood flow. There are a few reports of successful pregnancies with single ventricle and pulmonary stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>], but pulmonary vascular disease carries the expected high gestational risk associated with Eisenmenger syndrome.

In patients with tricuspid atresia, systemic venous return cannot reach the right ventricle directly because of an imperforate right atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve. Instead, systemic venous return traverses the atrial septum from a morphologic right atrium into a morphologic left atrium, and mixes with pulmonary venous return before crossing a solitary left atrioventricular (mitral) valve that connects the left atrium to the left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In the usual form of tricuspid atresia, there is ventriculo-great arterial concordance (non-transposed).

The Fontan operation, a palliative procedure performed for patients with single ventricle, creates an atrial-dependent or caval-dependent circulation in series without a subpulmonary ventricle. A nearly twofold increase in cardiac index can be achieved with isotonic exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>The implication of these hemodynamic observations is that women who have undergone successful Fontan repairs and who have satisfactory systemic ventricular function and normal sinus rhythm may have adequate hemodynamic reserve to accommodate the physiologic burden of pregnancy. However, high rates of spontaneous abortion and preterm deliveries have been observed. These event rates suggest that the alteration in placental blood flow caused by Fontan physiology is not well tolerated by the fetus. </p><p>Data are limited on pregnancy outcomes after a Fontan operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-specific-lesions/abstract/6,25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25,28</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General maternal and fetal risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reparative surgery has substantially increased the number of females with congenital heart disease who reach childbearing age. Successful operation before gestation is pivotal in reducing maternal and fetal risks. The risks of pregnancy after surgery are determined chiefly by the presence, type, and degree of cardiac and vascular residua and sequelae.
