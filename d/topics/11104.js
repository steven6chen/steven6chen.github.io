A few decades later, the organism (originally called <em>Vibrio</em>) was reported as an occasional cause of illness in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 1973, a new genus, <em>Campylobacter</em>, was designated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It was not until the 1980s that the full impact of <em>Campylobacter</em> infections on human health began to be appreciated; they are now known to be a leading cause of acute diarrhea and systemic illness worldwide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-infectious-diarrhea-and-other-foodborne-illnesses-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute infectious diarrhea and other foodborne illnesses in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>Campylobacter</em> spp are common commensals in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, especially poultry; thus, animal-to-human transmission of infections occurs frequently. The microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection will be reviewed here. The clinical features and treatment of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Campylobacter infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Campylobacters belong to a distinct group of specialized gram-negative bacteria designated rRNA superfamily VI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Apart from the genus <em>Campylobacter</em>, the group also contains <em>Arcobacter</em> and <em>Helicobacter</em>. Arcobacters are closely related to campylobacters, and some cause intestinal infection in humans. <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> is well known as a cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, but there are other <em>Helicobacter</em> species that cause infection of the human gut. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection with less common Campylobacter species and related bacteria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A feature common to all these bacteria is that they are adapted to colonize the surface of the mucous membranes of the alimentary and reproductive tracts. This adaptation is reflected in their morphology. The combination of spiral shape and long polar flagella leads to rapid motility that enables the organisms to &quot;corkscrew&quot; their way through mucus with a facility denied to conventional bacteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62173 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Most members of this group are microaerophilic, or partially anaerobic, and most undergo transformation into coccoid forms when exposed to adverse conditions, especially oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These appear to be degenerative forms, but some believe they are potentially dormant forms capable of long survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although some campylobacters can survive in cold water for several weeks, even months, they are not necessarily in coccal form. In general, these bacteria are fragile and easily destroyed by heat, desiccation, acidity, irradiation, and disinfectants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Campylobacter species</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many <em>Campylobacter</em> spp (&quot;atypical&quot; campylobacters) have now been recognized to cause human disease, as these organisms have been isolated from stool samples using filtration and antibiotic-free culture medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Eighteen species of <em>Campylobacter</em> are currently recognized and new species are being discovered with regularity. Most have been isolated at some time from humans. However, the most important species to cause human disease are <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> and <em>Campylobacter coli</em>, the principal causes of <em>Campylobacter </em>enteritis. The remainder of this topic review will be devoted to infection with these two species.</p><p><em>C. jejuni</em> has two subspecies: <em>C. jejuni</em> subsp <em>jejuni</em> and <em>C. jejuni</em> subsp <em>doylei</em>. The latter is a less common and a more fastidious organism than the former. For the sake of brevity, we will refer to <em>C. jejuni</em> subsp <em>jejuni</em> simply as <em>C. jejuni</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection in the laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard method for detecting campylobacters in clinical specimens is by culture. However, it is possible to make a presumptive identification by the microscopic examination of fresh stools of patients who are in the acute phase of diarrheal illness (eg, using dark-field, phase-contrast, or stained smears). This is less sensitive than culture (50 compared to 94 percent) and is not practiced routinely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Gram's stain is even less sensitive. <em>C. jejuni</em> appears as faint, gram-negative curved rods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78674\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78674 \">picture 2</a>). Direct microscopy of stool specimens may also reveal the presence of red blood cells or neutrophils, which are present in 75 percent of patients with <em>Campylobacter </em>enteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The culture of <em>Campylobacter</em> spp is optimally performed using selective media and incubation in a gas mixture of 5 to 10 percent oxygen, 1 to 10 percent carbon dioxide, and ideally some hydrogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69842 \">picture 3</a>). The optimum incubation temperature for <em>C. jejuni</em> and <em>C. coli</em> is 42 to 43&ordm;C; as a result, the term &quot;thermophilic&quot; campylobacters is sometimes applied to these species. In laboratories with limited facilities, successful results can be obtained by incubation in a candle extinction jar, provided that the plates are incubated at this higher temperature.</p><p>Growth is usually visible after overnight incubation, but two days are needed before a negative report can be issued. The policy in many laboratories is to incubate for the full two days before opening the sealed containers.</p><p>Direct plating on solid media is adequate for the culture of diarrheal stools, because campylobacters are present in large numbers. However, enrichment culture in a selective broth is recommended when the stool is not fresh or for formed stools from suspected carriers. Enrichment culture is essential for food and environmental samples, which may also require special pretreatment to correct for &quot;cold shock&quot; or other bacterial injury; this requires a laboratory with special expertise.</p><p>The identification of <em>Campylobacter</em> colonies is simple. The bacteria have a characteristic appearance under the microscope, which, together with analysis for oxidase and catalase production, is all that is needed for diagnosis. From a clinical standpoint, it is not necessary to speciate the bacteria into <em>C. jejuni</em> or <em>C. coli</em>, since the diseases they cause are indistinguishable; in most regions, 90 to 95 percent of infections are due to <em>C. jejuni</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, there are occasions when speciation and strain typing are required for epidemiologic purposes.</p><p>Strain typing is a task best performed at specialized reference laboratories. Serologic typing is the most widely used method. Two systems are in general use: the Penner scheme based upon heat-stable lipopolysaccharide 'O' antigens (over 90 serogroups); and the Lior scheme based upon heat-labile surface protein antigens (112 serogroups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of a limited set of antisera from each scheme gives good discrimination, which can be enhanced by the addition of biotyping <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phage typing.</p><p>Genotyping methods (eg, ribotyping), are capable of excellent discrimination, but are not standardized and none are universally accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other methods for the direct detection of <em>Campylobacter</em> in clinical specimens, such as DNA probes and amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been successful in research studies, and may be more sensitive than traditional cultures for the detection of and typing of these organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The whole genome sequences for eight <em>Campylobacter</em> species have been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other culture-independent diagnostic tests, such as stool antigen tests, are convenient and have become increasingly popular. However, because their sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for <em>Campylobacter</em> is quite variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], stool cultures remain the gold standard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bacterial and host factors responsible for the pathogenesis of and susceptibility to <em>Campylobacter</em> infection are just beginning to be identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors contribute to the ability of <em>Campylobacter</em> to produce illness including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of organisms ingested</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virulence of the infecting strain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host immunity</p><p/><p>Volunteer studies established that the infective dose could be as low as 500 bacteria, although, a higher dose (9000 bacteria) was needed to produce illness in 50 percent of the subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Campylobacters are sensitive to stomach acidity; as a result, underlying conditions or medications that reduce or buffer gastric acidity predispose to infection. Patients who use proton pump inhibitors are more susceptible to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The dilution and washing action of water and the buffering action of milk might well explain the inordinate size of some waterborne and milk borne outbreaks of <em>Campylobacter </em>enteritis (see below).</p><p>The mechanisms by which campylobacters are able to attach and invade the intestinal epithelium are complex and are facilitated by the presence of flagella, high molecular weight plasmids, superficial adhesins, and chemotactic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/19,22-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22-29</a>]. <em>Campylobacter</em> possess fimbriae-like filaments that enable the organism to attach to intestinal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The bacteria's flagellae promote the motility and chemotaxis needed for <em>C. jejuni</em> to colonize the intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The flagellar export apparatus is involved in the secretion of a number of proteins that affect invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Interestingly, unlike <em>Salmonella</em> and other enteric bacterial pathogens, the flagellins of <em>Campylobacter</em> do not elicit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, suggesting that flagellins may be important in the organism&rsquo;s ability to evade innate immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Intact flagellar synthesis genes are required for maximal <em>C. jejuni</em> invasiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A high-molecular-weight plasmid also enhances the invasive capabilities of <em>C. jejuni</em> virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/25,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,35</a>]. The plasmid, pVir, has been identified in some clinical <em>Campylobacter</em> isolates and was significantly associated with bloody stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. <em>C. jejuni</em> may adhere to epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], which favors gut colonization. Following attachment, several other bacterial surface proteins (eg, PEB1, CadF) help the organisms to colonize and then invade the intestinal epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Other important adhesins include JIpA, a surface exposed lipoprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and CadF, which mediates adhesion by binding to fibronectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Low-level production of enterotoxin has been observed in vitro, but production cannot be demonstrated in vivo and the enterotoxin does not appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of <em>Campylobacter</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/29,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,40</a>]. All <em>C. jejuni</em> isolates possess a gene coding for cytolethal distending toxin that may affect cell cycle kinetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]; however, not all isolates produce this toxin and its role in disease is not known. Some have postulated that this toxin may play a role in suppressing innate immunity by inducing death of macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Course of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an incubation period of about three days (range one to seven days), infection is established in the jejunum, ileum, and often the colon and rectum. A higher inoculum of bacteria is typically associated with a shorter incubation period and more severe illness. The histologic picture is that of acute mucosal inflammation with edema, cellular infiltration of the lamina propria, and crypt abscess formation. These findings are indistinguishable from those seen in salmonellosis and shigellosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Campylobacter infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Host immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humoral immune mechanisms likely play an important role in protection against infection with <em>Campylobacter</em>. Serum antibodies (eg, IgA, IgG, and IgM) peak two to four weeks postinfection and then decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Further support for the importance of a humoral immune mechanism in containing campylobacter infection is the observation that patients with hypogammaglobulinemia experience particularly severe and prolonged <em>Campylobacter</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The role of cellular immune mechanisms in containing <em>Campylobacter</em> infections is unclear. However, the observation that HIV-infected persons have more severe and persistent disease, and develop extraintestinal <em>Campylobacter</em> infections, suggest that cell-mediated immunity may confer some protection against these infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Campylobacter</em> enteritis is a leading cause of acute diarrhea worldwide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Campylobacters are found worldwide, including arctic, temperate, and tropical climates. </p><p>In the United States, the incidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> is assessed through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), which has collected data on nine major foodborne pathogens from selected sites since 1996. Throughout the course of the surveillance program, the incidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> has waxed and waned, but it has remained one of the two most frequently reported pathogens. In 2016, the incidence of culture-confirmed <em>Campylobacter</em> infections was estimated at 11.8 infections per 100,000 persons, which is lower than in the prior years but comparable to the rate in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Within the United States, there is considerable variation in the incidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> infections between states, with infections being more common in western states; for example, the infection rate in California is triple that in Tennessee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. </p><p>In Europe and Israel, the incidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> infections has increased over the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Burden of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deaths due to <em>Campylobacter</em> infection are rare in the United States, estimates are that 50 to 150 deaths annually, are at least in part, attributable to <em>Campylobacter</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The total cost of health care and lost productivity for <em>Campylobacter</em> enteritis in the United States is estimated at $1.5 to $8.0 billion annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Demography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age distribution of <em>Campylobacter </em>enteritis in industrialized countries is different from that of other enteric infections. Like most other infections, there is a high incidence in early childhood but, unlike others, there is a pronounced secondary peak in young adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56850 \">figure 1</a>) with a mild male predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/10,51,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,51,55</a>]. The reasons for this peak are unknown. Adults tend to be more severely affected than children, while infants usually tolerate the infection well.</p><p>A different pattern is seen in resource-limited settings where infection is hyperendemic. High transmission rates mean that children become repeatedly infected early in life. Initial infections are often associated with diarrhea, but as immunity is gained, subsequent infections are increasingly likely to be asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Thus, the disease is virtually unknown in older children and adults. In one series of children from Bangladesh and Thailand, IgG antibodies to surface protein antigens of <em>C. jejuni</em> rose early in childhood and then gradually fell; in comparison, IgA antibodies increased progressively through childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>In temperate zones, <em>Campylobacter</em> enteritis has a remarkably constant seasonal pattern characterized by a sharp rise of incidence in early summer, a peak in midsummer, and then a steady decline to base levels in winter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77639\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77639 \">figure 2</a>). A slight secondary peak is sometimes evident in late fall. The reasons for this seasonal pattern are unknown. The seasonal variations in the incidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection are not observed in tropical climates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources and transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. jejuni</em> and <em>C. coli</em> are carried by a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, notably birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]; <em>C. coli</em> is particularly associated with pigs. The bacteria are shed widely and can be found in almost any natural water, fresh or saline, in which they can survive for many weeks at temperatures below 15&ordm;C. Water can be a direct source of human infection, though food contamination from food-producing animals is a more significant problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Any raw meat can be contaminated with campylobacters. It is almost impossible to prevent contamination of carcasses from gut contents at slaughter. With large animals (eg, cattle, sheep, pigs), the use of air-blast chilling causes surface drying and substantially reduces the number of organisms. Thus, red meats, except offal, are seldom heavily contaminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p>Contamination of poultry occurs more frequently. Broiler chicken flocks can become heavily colonized, and the bacteria are spread liberally when the carcasses undergo mass processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. As a result, approximately 60 percent of retail broiler carcasses and their juices are contaminated with campylobacters, often with counts as high as 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> per chicken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. According to one study approximately 48 percent of <em>Campylobacter</em> infections are attributable to transmission via poultry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/64-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-68</a>]. Chickens are also a major source of quinolone-resistant <em>Campylobacter</em> infections, an effect that is related to quinolone use in poultry feeds in both the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

A typical example of cross contamination would be the cutting up of bread or salad on an unwashed board that had just been used to handle raw chicken.</p><p>In a substantial proportion of <em>Campylobacter</em> cases the source of infection is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/64,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,71</a>].

Community outbreaks are uncommon, probably because campylobacters are unable to multiply in food like Salmonellae. Important exceptions are outbreaks caused by the distribution of contaminated water or milk, which have infected as many as 3000 people at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/72-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-76</a>]. The following findings are noted in outbreaks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In waterborne outbreaks, the water has been unchlorinated or there has been a fault in the chlorination or distribution system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/72-74,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74,77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In milk borne outbreaks, the consumed milk has been raw or there has been a failure in the pasteurization process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/75,76,78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76,78-81</a>]. It is almost impossible to prevent milk becoming fecally contaminated even in the best run milking parlors. As a result, compulsory pasteurization of all milk sold to the public is the only remedy.</p><p/><p>Infection can also be acquired directly from animals or their carcasses. Direct transmission of this sort is usually occupational (eg, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, poultry processors), but domestic infection can also arise from contact with a pet, usually a puppy or kitten with <em>Campylobacter</em> diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/71,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,82,83</a>].</p><p>Person-to-person infectivity is generally low, although caretakers for children in diapers or incontinent individuals are at risk for transmission. Sexual transmission, presumably through fecal-oral contact, has also been reported. As an example, in one study of a prolonged outbreak of a particular drug-resistant <em>C. jejuni</em> isolate, the vast majority of the 31 affected individuals were men who have sex with men, among whom there were high rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because most <em>Campylobacter</em> infections are transmitted by preparing and consuming chicken, control of <em>Campylobacter</em> infections in broiler flocks is an important first step in reducing the incidence of this infection in humans. Methods used in mass processing and distribution of chicken may amplify the bacterial load. Strategies that have been suggested to reduce such amplification include improvement in chicken house hygiene and water supplies, flock vaccination, and competitive exclusion regimens feeding normal flora to chicks. Efforts to reduce cross-contamination during mass mechanized processing of broiler carcasses may also prove to be helpful in reducing poultry contamination with <em>Campylobacter</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Food handling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even with the employment of the best agricultural practices, it is unlikely that elimination of <em>Campylobacter</em> contamination of poultry will be achieved. The near universal contamination of poultry and the heavy bacterial burden makes such elimination impractical, if not impossible. Therefore, careful food handling practices in the kitchen should be directed towards reducing the risk of transmission to humans. Because <em>C. jejuni</em> is killed by heat, all meat, especially chicken, should be cooked to proper temperature (breasts to 170&ordm;F, thighs to 180&ordm;F). In addition to thorough cooking, care should be taken to avoid cross-contamination: cutting boards, knives, and other utensils used to prepare chicken should be thoroughly washed with hot, soapy water before being used to prepare salads or other foods eaten raw. Irradiation of food will kill <em>Campylobacter</em> as well as other pathogens, but is not yet acceptable to the public.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The direct transmission from animals may also be prevented by simple hygienic measures of which hand washing is by far the most important; this is particularly relevant to school children and students on farm visits and to families with pets (see above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Person-to-person transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although person-to-person transmission of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection is unusual, all persons (and especially those who have diarrhea), should wash their hands after using the bathroom. Persons with diarrhea should avoid preparing and handling food until their illness resolves. To date, there have been no reports of transmission of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection by asymptomatic excretors. Asymptomatically infected food handlers or hospital workers need not be excluded from work. However, the importance of hand washing should be emphasized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Water and milk borne transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The provision of purified water and the pasteurization (or other heat treatment) of all milk sold to the public are highly effective basic measures that prevent transmission of intestinal pathogens. Pregnant women, the elderly, and persons who are immunocompromised should take particular care to avoid unpasteurized dairy products. Travelers to resource-limited settings and campers should be cautioned against drinking untreated water.

Many <em>Campylobacter</em> spp (&quot;atypical&quot; campylobacters) are recognized to cause human disease; however, the most important species are <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> and <em>Campylobacter coli</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Campylobacter species'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volunteer studies have established that the infective dose of <em>Campylobacter</em> can be as low as 500 bacteria. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In temperate zones, <em>Campylobacter </em>enteritis has a constant seasonal pattern characterized by a sharp rise of incidence in early summer, a peak in midsummer, and then a steady decline to base levels in winter. The seasonal variations are not observed in tropical climates. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Demography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>C. jejuni</em> and <em>C. coli</em> are carried by a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, notably birds. The bacteria are shed widely and can be found in almost any natural water, in which they can survive for many weeks at temperatures below 15&ordm;C. Although water can be a direct source of human infection, it is the contamination by campylobacters of the food chain from food-producing animals that is the greater problem. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sources and transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any raw meat is likely to be contaminated with campylobacters as it is almost impossible to prevent contamination of carcasses from gut contents at slaughter. Approximately 60 percent of retail broiler carcasses and their juices are contaminated with campylobacters. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Sources and transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two ways infection is acquired from meats: eating raw or undercooked meat and eating uncooked or previously cooked food that has become cross contaminated from raw meat.
