Orthostatic headache, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse meningeal enhancement on brain MRI are the major features of the classic syndrome. However, some cases have nonorthostatic headache, normal CSF pressure, or no evidence of diffuse meningeal enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Our understanding of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is still evolving, and historically a number of other terms have been used to describe it:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous (or idiopathic) low CSF pressure headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low CSF volume headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoliquorrhoeic headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aliquorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF leak headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF hypovolemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF volume depletion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the intact craniospinal vault, the brain is supported by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such that a brain weight of 1500 g in air is only 48 g in CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As the CSF pressure decreases, there is a reduction in the buoyancy of the brain's supportive cushion. As a result, the brain &quot;sags&quot; in the cranial cavity, causing traction on the anchoring and supporting structures of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Most often, the headaches associated with low CSF pressure are orthostatic and occur after lumbar puncture, but similar headaches occur with spontaneous low CSF pressure due to spinal CSF leaks and with CSF shunt overdrainage. In addition, trauma, surgery, and other medical conditions have been associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107340173\"><span class=\"h2\">Cause of headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traction on pain-sensitive intracranial and meningeal structures, particularly sensory nerves and bridging veins, is thought to cause headache and some of the associated symptoms of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the upright position this traction is exaggerated, hence the postural component of the headache. Secondary vasodilation of the cerebral vessels to compensate for the low CSF pressure may contribute to the vascular component of the headache by increasing brain volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because jugular venous compression increases headache severity, it seems likely that venodilation is a contributing factor to the headache.</p><p>CSF hypovolemia, rather than CSF hypotension per se, has been proposed as the underlying cause of the headache syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], as patients with normal CSF pressure have been described who have clinical and radiographic features that are otherwise typical of orthostatic headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-10</a>]. In this paradigm, the CSF pressures, clinical manifestations, and imaging abnormalities of the syndrome are thought to be variables dependent on CSF volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] have therefore advocated the name &quot;CSF hypovolemia syndrome&quot; for the constellation of symptoms associated with CSF leakage.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that spinal loss of CSF results in an increased compliance at the caudal end of the spinal CSF space, and the abnormal distribution of craniospinal elasticity causes the headache syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This explanation is compatible with the observation that spinal sites of CSF leakage commonly produce orthostatic headache, whereas cranial sites of CSF leakage (eg, seen with spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea or CSF otorrhea) rarely if ever do so. (See <a href=\"#H107340188\" class=\"local\">'CSF leak'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cause of low CSF pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1891, Quincke introduced the lumbar puncture (LP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and in 1898 Bier suffered and was the first to report post-LP headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. He proposed that ongoing leakage of CSF through the dural puncture site was the cause of the headache. This belief is still held today. It is thought that leakage of CSF through the dural rent made by the LP needle exceeds the rate of CSF production, resulting in low CSF volume and pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-lumbar-puncture-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-lumbar puncture headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical syndrome of headache attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension has been recognized for many years. The syndrome was first proposed in 1938 by Schaltenbrand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], who termed it aliquorrhea, and described a headache syndrome virtually identical to that following LP. He proposed three possible mechanisms (decreased CSF production by the choroid plexus, increased CSF absorption, and CSF leakage through small tears) to explain the symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107340188\"><span class=\"h3\">CSF leak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Today, the prevailing etiology of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is that of CSF leakage located in the spine, which may occur in the context of rupture of an arachnoid membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An underlying connective tissue disorder may result in dural weakness and play a role in the development of spontaneous low CSF pressure, as suggested by studies reporting abnormal connective tissue abnormalities in patients with spontaneous CSF leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deficient fibrillin, elastin, or both in dermal fibroblast cultures from such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Meningeal diverticula, often seen in patients with CSF leaks, may be related to this connective tissue problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and meningeal diverticula have been described in patients with Marfan syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A potential contributing factor to the development of spontaneous low CSF pressure is that of minor trauma or an inciting event, including a fall, a sudden twist or stretch, sexual intercourse or orgasm, a sudden sneeze, sports activity, or &quot;trivial trauma&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These relatively minor events may cause rupture of spinal epidural cysts (formed during fetal development) or perineural (Tarlov) cysts, or may cause a tear in a dural nerve sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] with resultant cryptic CSF leakage.</p><p>In addition, degenerative disc disease, osseous spurs, and microspurs may lead to spontaneous intracranial hypotension by causing dural tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. Another uncommon cause is the spontaneous development of a spinal CSF venous fistula, which enables CSF to drain from the subarachnoid space directly into adjacent spinal epidural veins in the absence of a dural defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>The location of CSF leaks associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension is almost exclusively spinal; most occur at the thoracic or cervicothoracic junction. Few, if any, cases result from CSF leaks at the skull base. As an example, one series evaluated 273 patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and none had evidence of a cranial CSF leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In contrast to spinal leaks, some cases of spontaneous CSF leaks at the skull base (ie, into the petrous or ethmoidal regions, or through the cribriform plate, and typically associated with overt CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea) may result from sustained intracranial <strong>hypertension</strong> as occurs in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].

The lower pressure in the inferior vena cava leads to epidural venous hypotension and outflow of CSF along the spinal cavity, and in some cases precipitates actual CSF leaks from existing radicular arachnoid diverticula or cysts. In this paradigm, dural tears are not the cause of the condition but instead are a result of the low epidural pressure. Blood patching at the epidural lumbar space used to treat the condition does not work by sealing CSF leaks, but instead is effective because it disconnects the low-pressure epidural lumbar venous network, which drains to the inferior vena cava, and diverts venous return to the epidural thoracic and cervical venous network, which drains to the superior vena cava.</p><p>This hypothesis has been challenged by experts who dispute a number of its assumptions regarding the anatomic and pathophysiologic characteristics of the spinal epidural veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, the skeptics point out radiologic evidence that epidural veins are distended and the epidural sac is collapsed in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension prior to treatment, and that the epidural veins and dural sac return to normal proportions after treatment with blood patch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These pre-treatment observations are best explained by CSF hypotension with dural sac collapse and expansion of the extradural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data regarding the incidence of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

Headache caused by low CSF pressure following a lumbar puncture rarely creates a clinical dilemma.</p><p>Confirmation of the diagnosis requires evidence of low CSF pressure, most often by MRI (eg, pachymeningeal enhancement) or less often by radioisotope cisternography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of a CSF leak on other neuroimaging studies, mainly computed tomographic (CT) myelography.</p><p>For patients with suspected spontaneous intracranial hypotension, we recommend brain MRI with gadolinium and MRI of the spine without gadolinium to assess for the typical imaging features of the syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F103649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103649 \">algorithm 1</a>), which are diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55516\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55516 \">image 1</a>), &quot;sagging&quot; of the brain, tonsillar descent, posterior fossa crowding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77679\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77679 \">image 2</a>), and dilated cervical epidural veins. (See <a href=\"#H170414934\" class=\"local\">'Brain MRI'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Spine MRI'</a> below.)</p><p>Radioisotope cisternography is usually obtained as the next step if a CSF leak is suspected and MRI is normal or nondiagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Radioisotope cisternography'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the need for further evaluation to confirm the exact site of the CSF leak is driven by the patient&rsquo;s response to therapy. Patients who fail adequate trials of conservative therapy and repeated epidural blood patch treatments, the mainstay of therapy, may require definitive localization of the CSF leak or leaks in order to have surgical repair. This is usually accomplished with CT myelography (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'CT myelography'</a> below), though MR myelography (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'MR myelography'</a> below) is an alternative method. The localization of rapid (ie, high-flow) CSF leaks may require dynamic CT myelography (see <a href=\"#H4163484360\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic CT myelography'</a> below) or digital subtraction myelography (see <a href=\"#H2306800359\" class=\"local\">'Digital subtraction myelography'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic criteria for headache attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension, as delineated by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (ICHD-3), are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A) Any headache fulfilling criteria B through D</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B) Low CSF pressure (&lt;60 mmH<sub>2</sub>0) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of CSF leakage on imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C) Headache has developed in temporal relation to the low CSF pressure or CSF leakage, or has led to its discovery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D) Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain MRI is the preferred modality for confirming the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Spine MRI, radioisotope cisternography, and CT myelography can also be useful, particularly when brain MRI is nondiagnostic. However, neuroimaging studies are generally not done in patients with post-lumbar puncture headache, where the diagnosis is more obvious.</p><p>The utility of head CT for confirming the diagnosis is limited, as head CT is often normal in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. However, head CT may suggest the diagnosis by demonstrating subdural fluid collections, slit-shaped ventricles, tight basal cisterns, scant CSF over the cortex, or increased tentorial enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170414934\"><span class=\"h3\">Brain MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advent of MRI has greatly improved the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

According to the Monro-Kellie doctrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], any decrease in CSF volume must be compensated given the noncompressible nature of the skull.

In a report of 17 patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension, subtraction MRI of the spinal cord identified the epidural CSF fluid collection in all patients, although the site of the CSF leak was not detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

It is usually obtained as the next step if a CSF leak is suspected and MRI is normal or nondiagnostic. The procedure involves intrathecal injection, via lumbar puncture, of a radioisotope (indium-111 DTPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

Other findings suggestive of a CSF leak, though not as reliable, include early accumulation of radioisotope within the bladder and kidneys, leakage of isotope outside of the normal confines of the subarachnoid space, and early soft tissue uptake of radioisotope.

The temporal resolution of CT and MR myelography can be inadequate in the setting of rapid CSF leaks because the contrast can spread over many spinal levels during the time needed to obtain the CT or MRI images, obscuring the exact site of the dural defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Such rapid CSF leaks typically appear on CT and MRI as longitudinally extensive extradural fluid collections that are ventral to the spinal cord.</p><p>The superior temporal resolution of digital subtraction myelography may also be useful for the detection of direct spinal venous fistulae, which have been implicated as the cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension in cases where routine CT myelography and MRI myelography failed to identify a dural defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lumbar puncture (LP) can document low CSF pressure in suspected cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and may be diagnostically useful when MRI is not available or is not tolerated. However, LP is generally not necessary in cases where MRI is consistent with the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. There is also concern that dural puncture from the procedure could potentially worsen the low CSF pressure and exacerbate the syndrome.</p><p>The opening pressure with LP in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension usually ranges from 0 to 70 mmH<sub>2</sub>0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], whereas normal opening pressure is generally considered to be 60 to 200 mmH<sub>2</sub>O in adults and children; opening pressures up to 250 mmH<sub>2</sub>O may be normal in obese people.

Even within the same patient, the CSF pressure may vary from LP to LP. For greater accuracy, CSF pressure should be measured with the patient in the lateral decubitus position if an LP is performed. To ascertain correct placement of the spinal needle, CSF flow should be observed either spontaneously, with gentle aspiration, or with Valsalva maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Repeated attempts may be needed to obtain CSF, and traumatic blood-tinged fluid may result. In addition, so-called &quot;dry taps&quot; may be encountered, requiring cisternal taps to collect the fluid. In rare instances, the CSF pressure is negative (below that of atmospheric pressure), and a sucking noise may be heard when the stylet is removed from the LP needle.</p><p>The CSF is typically clear and colorless. Common CSF abnormalities include a moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis (up to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> the presence of red blood cells, and elevated protein (commonly up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The elevated protein may be related to lowered CSF pressure leading to disruption of normal hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the venous sinus and arachnoid villi, resulting in the passage of serum protein into the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>CSF cytology and microbiology is always normal and CSF glucose is never low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts placed for various neurosurgical indications may develop a syndrome identical to that of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, probably secondary to overdrainage (over shunting) of CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Orthostatic headache in the absence of CSF leak may also be a manifestation of the postural tachycardia syndrome or orthostatic intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

The diagnosis was often missed prior to the advancement of MRI imaging and the specific MRI findings associated with the syndrome. Even in the modern era of MRI availability, misdiagnosis is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>Inappropriate and unnecessary clinical investigations may result if the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is not considered. As an example, before diffuse meningeal enhancement on brain MRI was a recognized feature of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, patients with this finding were often subjected to extensive testing to rule out other causes such as meningeal carcinomatosis, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neuroborreliosis, and neurosarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H170414934\" class=\"local\">'Brain MRI'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic features of spontaneous intracranial hypotension are orthostatic headache, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse meningeal enhancement on brain MRI. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevailing etiology of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is CSF leakage at the level of the spinal cord, which may occur in the context of rupture of an arachnoid membrane. An alternative hypothesis is that low CSF pressure is caused by epidural venous hypotension from the lowering of venous pressure within the inferior vena cava system. Most CSF leaks occur at the thoracic or cervicothoracic junction. An underlying connective tissue disorder may play a role in the development of CSF leaks. Other potential contributing factors are minor trauma, degenerative disc disease, and osseous spurs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traction on pain-sensitive intracranial and meningeal structures, particularly sensory nerves and bridging veins, is thought to cause headache and some of the associated symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated annual incidence of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is 5 per 100,000, with a peak incidence around age 40 and a female to male ratio of 2:1. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension may be sudden or gradual in onset, and severity is widely variable. The headache is typically relieved with recumbency and exacerbated with upright posture. Other headache patterns have also been reported with this syndrome. Commonly associated symptoms are neck pain or stiffness, nausea and vomiting, change in hearing, and photophobia. There is a varied and extensive list of additional associated symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Headache'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Associated symptoms and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some rare but serious symptoms (eg, altered level of consciousness, parkinsonism) associated with the syndrome are probably caused by distortion or compression of brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spinal cord structures. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Associated symptoms and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension should be considered in patients who present with positional orthostatic headache, with or without associated symptoms, perhaps in the setting of minor trauma, and in the absence of a history of dural puncture or other cause of CSF fistula. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires evidence of low CSF pressure by MRI or lumbar puncture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of a CSF leak on CT myelography or radioisotope cisternography. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected spontaneous intracranial hypotension, we recommend brain MRI with gadolinium and spine MRI without gadolinium. Typical features on brain MRI include diffuse meningeal enhancement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55516\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55516 \">image 1</a>), subdural hematomas or hygromas, sagging of the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77679\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77679 \">image 2</a>), engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and pituitary enlargement. Brain MRI remains normal in up to 20 percent of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H170414934\" class=\"local\">'Brain MRI'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Spine MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have CSF shunts in place may develop a syndrome identical to that of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, probably secondary to overdrainage (over shunting) of CSF.
