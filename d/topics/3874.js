The attack rate in various outbreaks of gastroenteritis varied from 50 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Invasive infection seems to be rare, with the risk being greatest in immunocompromised, pregnant, or older adult patients. This was illustrated in a report of 57 adults who ingested contaminated cheese: 21 percent had bacteremia, 40 percent had meningitis, and 39 percent had meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Forty-two percent had an underlying disease, and more than one-half were at least 65 years of age. These findings suggest that a substantial number of normal people exposed to <em>Listeria</em> have asymptomatic or subclinical infection.</p><p>Sporadic gastroenteritis due to <em>L. monocytogenes</em> appears to be an uncommon illness as illustrated in a two-year population-based survey of stool specimens submitted for evaluation of diarrheal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. <em>Listeria</em> species were recovered in only 39 of 7775 (0.5 percent) stool specimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Listeriosis in pregnancy occurs most commonly during the third trimester, but fetal and neonatal adverse effects are less common as gestational age increases or with older gestational age at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a retrospective series of 11 patients from four hospitals over a 10-year period, nine patients were in the third trimester and the remaining two patients at 17 and 18 weeks of gestation, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Both of these latter deliveries resulted in fetal death, one following spontaneous abortion and the other fetal demise immediately after delivery. Six of the remaining nine neonates, all born preterm, had listerial infection. The three term infants were not infected.</p><p>In a study from Israel, 166 cases of pregnancy-related listeriosis were identified between 1998 and 2007 and accounted for 35 percent of all cases of listeriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The survival of the fetuses correlated with the trimester of pregnancy with 0, 29, and 95 percent survival during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively.</p><p>Fever, chills, and back pain may occur as presenting features of listeriosis in pregnant women; a nonspecific flu-like illness is the most common presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The infection may be mild, resolve without therapy, and the diagnosis missed if blood cultures are not obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].</p><p>There are no specific clinical indicators of listerial bacteremia in pregnant women, and central nervous system (CNS) invasion is uncommon. Thus, obtaining blood cultures should be considered in any pregnant woman who is febrile, when no alternative explanation (eg, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis) is readily apparent.</p><p>Listerial infection in pregnant women can lead to fetal death, premature birth, or infected newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/4,10,11,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11,13-17</a>]. A characteristic severe in utero infection, granulomatosis infantiseptica, may result from transplacental transmission. Infants with this disorder have disseminated abscesses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> granulomas in multiple internal organs (liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, brain). Skin lesions, papular or ulcerative, may develop. Most neonates with granulomatosis infantiseptica are stillborn or die soon after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Placental histopathology is distinctive since there is both a pronounced chorioamnionitis and an acute villitis with abscess formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61548\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61548 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The organisms are often visible within the amnion epithelium without special stains but are clearly demonstrated with Gram stain or methenamine silver stain.</p><p>Obstetricians may receive calls from pregnant patients who have ingested a food implicated in an outbreak of listeriosis that frequently receives wide media publicity. It is reasonable to reassure the asymptomatic patient and to recommend cultures of stool and blood for patients with symptoms, including diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Sepsis of unknown origin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Listerial sepsis may occur in patients of any age. Neonates probably acquire infection during or after birth. Infection in the first week of life is usually manifested by sepsis, while disease manifestations after the first week are more variable and often include meningitis. Early-onset sepsis is characterized by high neonatal mortality in association with maternal illness and premature delivery. With late-onset disease, babies generally are full term and have no history of perinatal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <em>Listeria</em> meningoencephalitis most often occurs in neonates after three days of age and in immunocompromised and older adults. Although <em>Listeria</em> may cause sepsis in immunocompromised children, it is relatively infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Adults with <em>Listeria</em> sepsis, most of whom are either immunocompromised or older, typically present with fever and chills. Septic shock can develop, and there may be seeding of the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meninges, leading to meningoencephalitis or cerebritis. Bacteremia without CNS invasion is the rule in pregnant women with listeriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but the risk of CNS invasion is greater in immunocompromised patients. In one report, 30 percent of infected renal transplant recipients presented with primary bacteremia, and almost all of the remaining patients had CNS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of listerial bacteremia can only be established by obtaining blood cultures.

Cerebritis, which infrequently progresses to brain abscess, and rhombencephalitis (brainstem encephalitis) are less common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Meningoencephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among 252 patients with CNS listeriosis in the MONALISA study, a nationwide prospective study in France, 212 (84 percent) had meningoencephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. <em>Listeria</em> meningoencephalitis most often occurs in neonates after three days of age and in immunocompromised and older adults. The importance of age was illustrated in a four state, multicenter survey of bacterial meningitis in the United States in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. <em>Listeria</em> accounted for 22 percent of cases in older adults, 23 percent in neonates, and only 4 percent between the ages of 2 and 60.</p><p>The importance of immunosuppression was illustrated in a review of 44 new cases and 776 previously reported cases (820 patients total) of CNS listeriosis (97 percent with meningoencephalitis) outside of pregnancy and the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The main predisposing factors were hematologic malignancy and renal transplantation, but 36 percent had no identifiable underlying disease.</p><p>The clinical presentation of <em>Listeria</em> meningoencephalitis ranges from a mild illness with fever and mental status changes to a fulminant course with coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/12,21,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21,24,25</a>]. Most adults have a subacute illness and, in the review of 820 patients, 42 percent presented without signs of meningeal irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

These include cranial nerve abnormalities, ataxia, tremors, hemiplegia, and deafness. Seizures can occur and often begin later in the course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>A subacute presentation with cranial nerve palsies, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, and low glucose may mimic tuberculous or fungal meningitis. The CSF culture is usually positive for <em>Listeria</em> in such patients, but positive blood cultures rarely occur in the presence of negative CSF cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, the syndromes of meningitis and cerebritis can occur in the same patient. The clinical presentation of cerebritis ranges from fever and headache to hemiplegia, resembling a stroke.</p><p>Progression to frank brain abscess is an uncommon complication. One case series reported five patients with listerial brain abscess, three of whom were cardiac transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A subsequent report from Norway found a much higher prevalence (19 cases among 172 adults with serious listeriosis [11 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among 818 cases of listeriosis in a nationwide prospective study in France, 252 had CNS listeriosis; of the patients with CNS listeriosis, 42 (17 percent) had brainstem involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Rhombencephalitis often follows a biphasic course, beginning with headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting, followed in several days by cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, tremor, and other cerebellar signs, decreased consciousness, and possibly seizures and hemiparesis. Almost one-half develop respiratory failure.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of rhombencephalitis includes a range of infectious and noninfectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although <em>Listeria</em> monocytogenes is the most common infectious cause of rhombencephalitis, other infectious etiologies of encephalitis that may involve the brainstem <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebellum include herpes simplex encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis and other fungal infections, Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus, brucellosis, and JC virus. Noninfectious conditions that can cause brainstem <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebellar lesions include multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, systemic rheumatic diseases (Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, relapsing polychondritis), lymphoma, and paraneoplastic syndromes.</p><p>Analysis of CSF often reveals only mild abnormalities, which can delay the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. CSF and blood cultures are positive in 40 and 60 percent of cases, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging better demonstrates the brainstem abnormalities than computed tomographic scan, which is often normal at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The overall mortality in the 62 reported cases was 51 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. All untreated patients died, while more than 70 percent of patients who were treated early with antibiotics survived. However, 61 percent of the survivors had neurologic sequelae.

For gastroenteritis, the mean incubation period is 24 hours (range 6 hours to 10 days), whereas for invasive listeriosis the median incubation period is 11 days with 90 percent of cases occurring within 28 days. (See <a href=\"#H418301\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile gastroenteritis secondary to listerial infection typically occurs after ingestion of a large inoculum of bacteria from contaminated food. The typical duration of symptoms is two days or less, and recovery is generally complete. Invasive infection seems to be rare, with the risk being greatest in immunocompromised, pregnant, or older adult patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Febrile gastroenteritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listeriosis in pregnancy most often occurs in the third trimester and can lead to fetal death, premature birth, or infected newborns. A nonspecific flu-like illness is the most common presentation, and central nervous system (CNS) invasion is uncommon. There are no specific clinical indicators of listerial bacteremia. Thus, obtaining blood cultures should be considered in any pregnant woman who is febrile, when no alternative explanation (eg, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis) is readily apparent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infection in pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis of unknown origin typically presents with fever and chills, primarily in patients who are immunocompromised or older. The diagnosis is established by blood cultures. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Sepsis of unknown origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common CNS manifestation of listerial infection is meningoencephalitis, which ranges from a mild illness with fever and mental status changes to a fulminant course with coma. Many patients do not have signs of meningeal irritation. Cerebritis, which infrequently progresses to brain abscess, and rhombencephalitis (brainstem encephalitis) are less common CNS manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'CNS infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous focal manifestations of listeriosis have been described in case reports and small series. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Focal infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clinical way to separate <em>Listeria</em> infection from many other infectious diseases that can lead to fever and constitutional symptoms. As a result, the diagnosis can only be established by culture of the organism from the cerebrospinal fluid or blood. Patients with CNS manifestations other than meningitis have a higher rate of positive blood cultures than CNS cultures. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals a pleocytosis that is typically associated with a moderate elevation in protein concentration and may be associated with a low glucose concentration. Listerial infection is the one cause of bacterial (nontuberculous) meningitis in which a substantial number of lymphocytes (&gt;25 percent) may be found in the CSF. Gram stain is positive in only about one-third of patients and the organisms may resemble pneumococci (diplococci) or diphtheroids (Corynebacteria) or be gram variable and be confused with <em>Haemophilus</em> species. The CSF analysis may be normal or show only mild abnormalities in patients with rhombencephalitis.
