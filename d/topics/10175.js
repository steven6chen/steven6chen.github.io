Three species cause lymphatic filariasis: <em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em>, <em>Brugia malayi</em>, and <em>Brugia timori</em>. Infection is transmitted by mosquito vectors; humans are definitive hosts. Lymphatic filariasis is a major cause of disfigurement and disability in endemic areas, leading to significant economic and psychosocial impact.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of lymphatic filariasis will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of lymphatic filariasis and other filarial infections (including onchocerciasis, loiasis, and mansonellosis) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphatic-filariasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphatic filariasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mansonella-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mansonella infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to treatment of lymphatic filariasis requires an understanding of antimicrobial agent mechanisms as well as attention to the possibility of coinfection. The clinical approach is described below, followed by a discussion of data related to individual antimicrobial agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15810528\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of choice for lymphatic filariasis is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diethylcarbamazine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diethylcarbamazine</a> (DEC), although this agent is contraindicated in patients coinfected with onchocerciasis and must be used with caution in patients with loiasis, since severe adverse events can occur in individuals with high microfilarial loads. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Based on the available data in the literature, we favor the clinical approach discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225507\"><span class=\"h3\">Monoinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with lymphatic filariasis (in the absence of onchocerciasis or loiasis) should receive treatment with DEC (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for 12 days), regardless of whether clinical symptoms or microfilaremia are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Early lymphatic changes may be present before the onset of symptoms, and reversal of early lymphatic dysfunction has been observed following DEC treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for four to six weeks) is also appropriate based on data demonstrating that doxycycline has macrofilaricidal activity and reduces pathology in mild to moderate disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Treatment is generally warranted even in the setting of advanced disease to kill any remaining adult parasites, although clinical improvement may be limited.</p><p>Mass drug treatment programs in areas that are not endemic for onchocerciasis or loiasis use yearly administration of single-dose DEC (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> alone or in combination with single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a> to reduce microfilarial loads and transmission of the infection. This regimen has an effect on adult worm viability, although there are no data comparing the efficacy of a single course of DEC treatment given for 1 day or 12 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225560\"><span class=\"h3\">Concomitant infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DEC is contraindicated in patients coinfected with onchocerciasis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients with loiasis who have high microfilarial loads due to the possibility of severe adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225530\"><span class=\"h4\">Onchocerciasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DEC is contraindicated in patients with onchocerciasis, due to the potential for severe adverse events related to killing of microfilariae in the eye <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin. Therefore, treatment of onchocerciasis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> single dose) should be administered to clear <em>O. volvulus</em> microfilariae in the skin and eyes prior to standard treatment of lymphatic filariasis. (See <a href=\"#H225507\" class=\"local\">'Monoinfection'</a> above.)</p><p>Based on kinetic studies of microfilarial clearance from the skin following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> administration, it seems prudent to wait approximately one month between administration of ivermectin and initiation of DEC treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In patients with ocular involvement, the length of time needed to prevent exacerbation of eye disease with DEC is unknown. Consequently, alternative therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 mg orally once daily for four to six weeks) followed by ivermectin (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> orally single dose) is reasonable for treatment of both infections; however, the efficacy of this regimen compared with standard therapy for treatment of lymphatic filariasis is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225547\"><span class=\"h4\">Loiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DEC is the treatment of choice for patients with <em>Loa loa</em> coinfection and low or undetectable levels of circulating microfilariae. However, as the microfilarial load increases, the incidence of severe adverse effects (including fatal encephalopathy) related to the rapid killing of microfilariae also increases. For patients with lymphatic filariasis who are coinfected with <em>Loa loa</em> but have &lt;2500 <em>Loa loa</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> of blood, DEC therapy using the standard regimen for loiasis (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> for 21 days) should be administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with higher levels of <em>Loa loa</em> microfilaremia (but less than 8000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> pretreatment can be used to reduce the microfilarial load prior to administration of DEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with <em>Loa loa</em> microfilarial loads greater than 8000 <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 mg orally once daily for four to six weeks), which has no effect on <em>Loa loa</em>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a> (200 to 400 mg with fatty meal twice daily for 21 days) also has no direct effect on <em>Loa loa</em> microfilariae and is a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot take doxycycline. Issues related to management of high-level <em>Loa</em> microfilaremia are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selection of therapy for treatment of lymphatic filariasis requires an understanding of the microfilaricidal and macrofilaricidal activity of therapeutic agents. The epidemiology of other filarial diseases is also important; in regions where loiasis and onchocerciasis may coexist with lymphatic filariasis, additional consideration is important for minimizing the likelihood of adverse effects.</p><p>Most of the studies regarding the efficacy of various regimens are derived from data from mass chemotherapy programs. These data are helpful in determining the relative efficacy of the drugs and combinations in terms of microfilaricidal and macrofilaricidal activity but do not necessarily provide optimal data on management of infected individuals, particularly for patients outside of endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Diethylcarbamazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DEC, a piperazine derivative, is a potent microfilaricidal and macrofilaricidal agent with activity against <em>W. bancrofti</em>, <em>B. malayi</em>, and <em>B. timori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The mechanism of action is uncertain; it is thought to alter microfilarial surface membranes or inhibit filarial release of immunomodulatory eicosanoids, thereby enhancing destruction via host immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. DEC also has macrofilaricidal activity, likely via hyperpolarization leading to immobilization of adult worms. Estimates suggest DEC kills approximately 50 percent of adult worms, and its effect on adult worms in turn decreases the microfilarial burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects of DEC include fever, headache, anorexia, nausea, and arthralgias. These effects are likely attributable to the host response following death of microfilariae (systemic reactions) and damage to adult worms (local reactions). Dying microfilariae probably release lipopolysaccharide-like proteins from endosymbiotic <em>Wolbachia</em> organisms within the filariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Management consists of administration of antipyretic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antiinflammatory agents. Since post-DEC reactions are more severe in onchocerciasis and loiasis, evaluation for these coinfections should be pursued prior to administering DEC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onchocerciasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onchocerciasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DEC should be avoided in pregnancy.

Therefore, the reduction in microfilaremia is not sustained without repeat dosing. The clinical benefit of ivermectin is uncertain given the lack of activity against adult worms, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of lymphangitis and lymphedema. Ivermectin may have some effect in reducing the fertility of worms (in addition to its microfilaricidal activity).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ivermectin</a> is at least as effective as DEC in reducing microfilaremia due to Bancroftian filariasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]; a single dose has been shown to reduce microfilaremia by approximately 90 percent even one year after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphatic-filariasis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Although most studies have demonstrated enhanced suppression of microfilaremia with albendazole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> as compared with ivermectin alone, albendazole does not appear to increase the microfilaricidal efficacy of DEC.

The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for four to six weeks) is also appropriate based on data demonstrating that doxycycline has macrofilaricidal activity and reduces pathology in mild to moderate disease. (See <a href=\"#H225507\" class=\"local\">'Monoinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with coinfection due to lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis (in the absence of evidence for eye involvement) should undergo treatment of onchocerciasis first, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> single dose) alone, followed by standard treatment for lymphatic filariasis. In patients with eye involvement, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 mg orally once daily for four to six weeks) followed by ivermectin (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> orally single dose) can be used, although the relative efficacy of this regimen compared with the standard DEC-containing regimen is not known. (See <a href=\"#H225530\" class=\"local\">'Onchocerciasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to patients with concomitant infection due to lymphatic filariasis and loiasis depends on the level of circulating <em>Loa loa</em> microfilaremia. For patients with &lt;2500 <em>Loa loa</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> of blood, DEC therapy using the standard regimen for loiasis (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> for 21 days) should be administered. For patients with &gt;2500 but &lt;8000 <em>Loa loa</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> of blood, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> can be used to decrease the <em>Loa loa</em> mf load prior to DEC treatment. For patients with &gt;8000 <em>Loa loa</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">microfilariae/mL</span> of blood, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 mg orally once daily for four to six weeks), which has no effect on <em>Loa loa</em>, is the treatment of choice for the lymphatic filariasis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albendazole</a> (200 to 400 mg with fatty meal twice daily for 21 days) has no direct effect on <em>Loa loa</em> microfilariae and is a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot take doxycycline. Issues related to management of high-level <em>Loa</em> microfilaremia are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"#H225547\" class=\"local\">'Loiasis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loiasis-loa-loa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loiasis (Loa loa infection)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of chronic complications of lymphatic filariasis is an important component of therapy. Secondary (often bacterial) infections are contributing determinants of worsening lymphedema and elephantiasis, particularly in individuals with late-stage disease. Aggressive treatment of secondary infections and close attention to hygiene is critical. Individuals with lymphedema should wash affected areas twice daily, use antibacterial creams on small abrasions, keep nails clean, and wear shoes. The affected limb should be exercised regularly to promote lymph flow and should be elevated at night. Prophylactic antibiotics may be necessary in some cases. Hydrocelectomy can be useful in reducing morbidity in affected patients. (See <a href=\"#H2825290\" class=\"local\">'Management of chronic pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mass drug administration reduces the bloodborne reservoir of microfilariae to a level below that required for sustained transmission by local mosquito vectors. Programs have been initiated in more than 60 countries and use various combinations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albendazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albendazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a>, and DEC. These programs have led to suppression of transmission to &lt;1 percent (the predicted threshold for elimination) in several countries; many challenges remain.
