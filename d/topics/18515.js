Our recommendations are generally consistent with the recommendations of the American Heart Association (AHA) with the distinction that the AHA's indications for BPV are based on the resting gradient as determined with the patient sedated in catheterization laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Survival is dependent on maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus by the administration of prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) therapy, thereby providing adequate pulmonary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

BPV is the procedure of choice, since it is as effective as surgical correction and is less invasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-subvalvar-and-supravalvar-pulmonic-stenosis-ps-and-peripheral-pulmonic-stenosis-pps-in-children-management-and-outcome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, urgent surgical intervention may be required if BPV fails. Prostaglandin therapy can be discontinued following dilation; however, infants may remain cyanotic over weeks with residual right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale because of persistent right ventricle (RV) noncompliance. This typically resolves over time, but in some cases, additional pulmonary blood flow with a surgically placed aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt (modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98391 \">figure 1</a>) or central shunt) may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H767128421\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild PS (gradient &lt;40 mmHg)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild valvar PS is generally benign and these patients do not require intervention.

The goal of intervention is to improve symptoms and prevent irreversible cardiac injury. BPV is the preferred procedure in patients with typical valvular dome-shaped PS. Surgery is generally reserved for patients with dysplastic pulmonary valves and hypoplastic annulus or main PA, or for those with supravalvar or subvalvar PS.

In our center, we use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild stenosis (gradient &lt;40 mmHg)</strong> &ndash; Patients with mild stenosis are initially followed at six-month intervals until they reach one or two years of age. If the gradient regresses so that it is &lt;25 mmHg, follow-up can be done at five-year intervals. If the gradient remains between 25 and 40 mmHg after one year, the frequency of follow-up can be decreased with follow-up at one year following the second echocardiography, and then subsequent follow-up every three years. Of note, women with mild PS can develop more severe disease during pregnancy. Hence, it is important to continue to monitor these patients through adulthood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and valve disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate stenosis (gradient 40 to 60 mmHg)</strong> &ndash; Patients with moderate PS are monitored every one to two years. If the pressure remains consistently &gt;55 mmHg or symptoms develop, the patient is referred for catheter-based or surgical intervention (in most cases of valvar PS, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty [BPV] is the preferred procedure as previously discussed). (See <a href=\"#H4044994564\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>After intervention</strong> &ndash; If the gradient remains mild after intervention, follow-up visits are conducted every year initially for the first two years and subsequent visits are performed every three to five years; the frequency depends on the individual patient's clinical status. Patients are monitored for evidence of restenosis and for evidence of clinically significant pulmonary insufficiency (PI):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Restenosis</strong> &ndash; Reintervention is considered if there is evidence of restenosis, using the same criteria used for initial dilation. Other factors used to consider reintervention include increased right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, or RV dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pulmonary insufficiency</strong> &ndash; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is useful in determining the degree of PI and RV size and function. Considerations regarding need and timing of pulmonary valve replacement for patients with PI are similar to those in other conditions (eg, tetralogy of Fallot) and are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1457298206\" class=\"local\">'Severity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3522038730\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of pediatric patients with PS may consist of conservative management, catheter-based intervention (ie, percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty [BPV]), or surgical valvotomy. The choice is based on the severity of PS and the level of obstruction (valvar, subvalvar, or supravalvar). When intervention is required for patients with valvar PS, BPV is the preferred procedure because it is equally effective but less invasive than surgical repair. Surgical intervention may be required for patients with supravalvar and subvalvar PS, and in some patients with dysplastic pulmonary valves and a hypoplastic annulus or main pulmonary artery (PA). (See <a href=\"#H3639900843\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2786908190\" class=\"local\">'Valvotomy procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management approach according to severity of PS is as follows (see <a href=\"#H2279517325\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Critical PS &ndash; Neonates with critical PS require urgent intervention, including prompt administration of prostaglandin E1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>) to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus followed by definitive intervention with BPV once the neonate is medically stable.

Mild PS is a benign condition; however, ongoing monitoring is needed, especially during the first two years of life, as more severe obstruction may develop in a small number of patients. (See <a href=\"#H767128421\" class=\"local\">'Mild PS (gradient &lt;40 mmHg)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2287154829\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate PS (gradient 40 to 60 mmHg) &ndash; The natural course of moderate PS varies and the criteria for intervention are not certain. We suggest BPV if the gradient approaches 60 mmHg by echocardiography or if symptoms develop (eg, exercise intolerance) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4235097574\" class=\"local\">'Moderate PS (gradient 40 to 60 mmHg)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe PS (gradient &gt;60 mmHg) &ndash; For infants and children with severe PS, we recommend catheter-based or surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). BPV is the preferred procedure in most cases of valvar PS. Uncorrected severe PS results in irreversible right ventricular injury.
