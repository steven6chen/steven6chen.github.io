The perinatal mortality rate encompasses late fetal and early neonatal mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of standard terminology facilitates comparisons of mortality rates among states and countries. A 2016 clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Fetus and Newborn established standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths, based on standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following definitions are recommended and used in this review. Standard definitions for reporting reproductive health statistics are published by <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsSbQEPTKnNd12JB9GZ/yuJk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4973\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the NCHS</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Live birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Live birth is defined as complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which shows any evidence of life (ie, heartbeats, umbilical cord pulsations, breathing, or voluntary muscle movement), regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Heartbeats should be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions and breathing distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal death (stillbirth)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fetus is defined from weeks after conception until term while in the uterus. Death of the fetus occurs prior to complete expulsion or extraction from the mother, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which is not an induced pregnancy termination. Fetal death is indicated by no signs of life after delivery (eg, heartbeats, umbilical cord pulsations, breathing, or voluntary muscle movement, as noted above). Heartbeats should be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions, and breathing from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Incidence, etiology, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The NCHS reports fetal deaths that occur &ge;20 weeks gestation, which are also referred to as &quot;stillbirth.&quot; For statistical purposes, the NCHS further subdivides fetal death as &quot;early&quot; (20 to 27 weeks gestation) or &quot;late&quot; (&ge;28 weeks gestation). The WHO defines stillbirth as at or after 28 weeks gestation. Pregnancies resulting in fetal demise before 20 weeks are categorized as miscarriages.</p><p>However, because birth weight (BW) can be more objectively and accurately measured than estimated gestational age (GA), Guidelines for Perinatal Care and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that requirements for reporting fetal deaths should be based upon BW &ge;500 g. This has not been adopted by all states or the NCHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

The NCHS defines late fetal death rate as the number of fetal deaths &ge;28 weeks gestation during a year divided by the sum of live births plus late fetal deaths during the same year, expressed per 1000 live births plus late fetal deaths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175936185\"><span class=\"h2\">Infant death and mortality rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infant death is defined as a live birth that results in death within the first year of life (&lt;365 days). The infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of infant deaths less than one year of age (0 to 365 days of life) during a year, divided by the number of live births reported during the same year, expressed per 1000 live births.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal death and mortality rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal death is defined as an infant death before 28 days of age.

The NCHS does not report this as a vital statistic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Three different definitions are used for perinatal death, which vary globally:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definition 1 &ndash; Sum of infant deaths that occur at less than 7 days of age and fetal deaths with a gestational age of 28 weeks or more.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definition 2 &ndash; Sum of infant deaths that occur at less than 28 days of age and fetal deaths with a gestational age of 20 weeks or more.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definition 3 &ndash; Sum of infant deaths that occur at less than 7 days of age and fetal deaths with a gestational age of 20 weeks or more.</p><p/><p>The NCHS uses both definition 1 and 2 to classify perinatal deaths. The WHO and NCHS use definition 1 to make international comparisons, which accounts for variability in registering fetal death between 20 and 27 weeks gestation. However, definition 2 is more inclusive and is more appropriate to monitor perinatal death throughout gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175936280\"><span class=\"h1\">US REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, live births, deaths, and fetal deaths are reported as vital events. The National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) has developed a flowchart to assist hospitals with the appropriate reporting of fetal and infant deaths, and live births (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69524\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69524 \">algorithm 1</a>) based on the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) definitions.</p><p>Although the Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations recommends reporting all fetal deaths with birth weights (BW) &ge;350 g or, if the BW is unknown, gestational age (GA) &gt;20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], states have the right to determine registration criteria, which results in variation of the reporting of these events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the quality and quantity of reported clinical information also varies among the states.</p><p>In addition to demographic information (ie, maternal ethnicity and age) and maternal medical history, including risk factors, the following minimal information should be obtained for each of these events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For live births, reported information should include BW, GA, and delivery information. In the event of infant death, the time to survival, and the cause of death should be listed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For fetal deaths, deaths should be reported based on the state criteria and should include BW, GA, cause of fetal demise, and, if pertinent, delivery information.</p><p/><p>Medical record documentation should use accurate definitions based on state criteria to ensure that reliable data on perinatal death are recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If a delivery of a fetus of uncertain viability is considered to be a live birth, the event is reported as a live birth regardless of BW, length of gestation, survival time, or other clinical information (eg, Apgar scores) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, if there are no signs of life at delivery, the event is assigned as a fetal death. Apgar scores should not be assigned and the fetus should not be admitted to the nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARISON OF MORTALITY RATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparison of mortality statistics across states or countries is challenging for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in the definitions employed &minus; In the United States, the minimum gestational age (GA) used to calculate fetal death is 20 weeks, and the postnatal days used to calculate perinatal mortality rate (PMR) is either 7 or 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. In comparison, the minimum GA ranges from 16 to 28 weeks among European countries, and the perinatal period used to calculate PMR ranges from 7 to 28 postnatal days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth weight (BW) versus GA &minus; Use of BW rather than GA may further limit some comparisons because BW data do not identify fetal growth restriction (FGR), which frequently compounds prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in birth and death registration &minus; The process of birth and death registration varies considerably among countries, especially when infants are born very prematurely or die soon after delivery. Perinatal statistics are particularly unreliable in developing countries, and whenever a substantial number of births takes place outside of hospitals or birthing centers unattended by trained individuals. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prematurity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Japan has the lowest infant mortality rate (IMR) at 2.1 per 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are 29 other nations with at least 40,000 births per year that have a lower IMR than the United States. It is thought that the higher IMR in the US is due in part to the higher percentage of preterm births. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prematurity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence and mortality of the preterm infant&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Developing countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2000, neonatal deaths accounted for 38 percent of all child deaths worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Almost all of the four million neonatal deaths (99 percent) occurred in developing countries. Poverty was strongly associated with neonatal mortality rate (NMR). NMR was almost 10 times greater in countries with moderate and low income than in high-income countries (33 versus &lt;4 deaths per 1000 live births). The highest NMR occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (over 45 deaths per 1000 live births), but the greatest absolute number of deaths occurred in south-central Asia. The main causes of death were prematurity (28 percent), infection (26 percent), and perinatal hypoxic insult (23 percent).</p><p>In a population-based study performed in Bangladesh, maternal complications during labor increased NMR fivefold and accounted for 30 percent of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Complications included prolonged or obstructed labor, abnormal fetal position, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p><p>A systematic review and cost analysis identified 16 cost-effective interventions (eg, maternal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> supplementation, detection and treatment of mothers with asymptomatic bacteriuria, and antibiotics for preterm rupture of membranes) that would improve neonatal survival in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This analysis provided a health system structure to implement these interventions at the family-community and individual patient level (pregnancy, delivery, and birth). With universal application, the study estimated that mortality rates would decrease by 59 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences in the availability of <span class=\"nowrap\">timely/accurate</span> prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination facilities, as well as population acceptance of termination of anomalous pregnancies can greatly influence regional PMR. In developed countries, timely and accurate prenatal diagnosis followed by termination of anomalous pregnancies has been shown to cut PMR by half. This was demonstrated by a large screening prenatal ultrasound trial in Finland that reported a 49 percent reduction in PMR for pregnancies in women who were randomly selected to receive ultrasound screening between 16 and 20 weeks gestation compared with controls who received standard of care (4.6 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In a birth cohort study of all live births, stillbirths, and infant deaths in Canada for the years 1991 to 1998, IMR decreased approximately 15 percent from the time period 1991 to 1995 (range 6.1 to 6.4 percent) and 1996 to 1997 (range 5.4 to 5.5 percent), while fetal deaths caused by pregnancy termination increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Over this time period, infant deaths from congenital anomalies declined from 1.9 to 1.5 percent.</p><p>Ongoing cutting-edge research has led to an increasing number of live births of fetuses that have undergone in-utero interventions for previously potentially lethal conditions. These efforts will affect both perinatal and neonatal mortality.

Over 40 years, the early neonatal mortality rate (NMR, &lt;7 days of age) has also declined to 3.22 per 1000 live births in 2012 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108372\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108372 \">figure 1</a>) and the overall NMR (&lt;30 days of age) was 3.94 per 1000 live births in 2013. </p><p>Major factors that influence mortality rates include ethnicity, gestational age (GA), and multifetal pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative disparities in perinatal and neonatal mortality among different <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> populations still persist. The PMR for black infants was 2.3 times that of white infants in 2005 (12.2 versus 5.4 fetal deaths per 1000 live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the infant mortality rate (IMR) was similarly higher in 2012 (1.1 versus 0.5 infant deaths per 1000 live births) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59601\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59601 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The racial disparity is explained largely by the higher incidence of prematurity in blacks.

In the main study sample of non-Hispanic white infants born at 37 to 41 weeks gestation between 1995 and 2001, the NMR had a U-shaped relationship with advancing GA: NMR decreased with increasing GA from 37 to 39 weeks, remained stable from 39 to 40 weeks gestation, and increased at &ge;41 weeks gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prematurity is a major contributor to neonatal and infant mortality. PMR and NMR increase with decreasing GA in preterm infants (GA &lt;37 weeks).

This was illustrated by a report that demonstrated the deaths of 7 percent of ELBW infants who died in Ohio between January and June of 2006 were not registered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The failure to register deaths was attributed to the short lifespan of these infants, resulting in the potential for their deaths to be misclassified as fetal deaths, thereby falsely lowering the early NMR and increasing the late fetal death rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Multifetal pregnancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple births accounted for 34 per 1000 live births in the United States in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This was primarily due to twin births (33.9 per 1000 live births), which have increased from a rate of 22.6 in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

This difference persisted even when rates were adjusted for socioeconomic status and medical complications.</p><p>From 1980 to 1998, the United States fetal death rate decreased by 26.4 percent (9.1 to 6.7 per 1000 live births plus late fetal deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. From 1994 to 2005, the early fetal death rate remained stable at 3.2 per 1000 live births plus fetal deaths, while the late fetal death rate declined from 4.3 to 3.1 per 1000 live births plus fetal deaths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108372\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108372 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/2,16,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,26</a>]. This decline is likely related to the widespread use of prenatal sonography, fetal surveillance with biophysical profile and Doppler velocimetry in high-risk pregnancies, improved management of gestational disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus and hypertension), decreasing fetal infections and fetal anemia, and the practically universal use of continuous intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>]. However, it remains to be seen how the fetal and perinatal mortality will be affected by the emergence of Zika virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zika virus infection: Evaluation and management of pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a large Swedish population-based study of 656,134 singleton pregnancies between 1987 and 1997, the time point when the fetal death rate exceeded the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) was identified as 40 weeks and 3 days, thus providing a functional definition of prolonged pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Causes and management of fetal deaths are discussed in greater detail separately.

Substantial reduction in the number of deaths caused by prematurity has been associated with increased use of antenatal glucocorticoids and the availability of surfactant treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.

The rate of infant mortality for babies born very low birth weight (VLBW) (BW &lt;1500 g) is 100 times higher than that for babies born weighing more than 2500 g.

Neonatal mortality also may differ among local institutions, even when adjustments are made for prematurity rates. These differences may be due in part to specific characteristics of newborn care, and suggest that infants at high risk should be delivered in hospitals with tertiary level neonatal intensive care units (NICU). This was illustrated by two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from the Canadian Neonatal Network, risk-adjusted outcomes were compared in infants born &le;32 weeks gestation and admitted to 17 NICUs in Canada during 1996 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Infants born outside of tertiary care centers who required transfer to a NICU were at greater risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5) and other adverse outcomes compared with inborn infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report that evaluated outcomes of infants with BW &lt;2000 g born in 1992 and 1993 in California, survival was more likely with birth at a regional center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Risk-adjusted mortality was higher when infants were born in hospitals with no NICU (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.81-3.13), an intermediate NICU (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.44-2.54), or a small community NICU with average census &lt;15 (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.76) compared with hospitals with a regional NICU (average census of &ge;15 patients and availability of tertiary care).</p><p/><p>The availability of neonatologists likely affects neonatal mortality. In a study of the relationship of the distribution of neonatologists and neonatal death, the supply of specialized services varied across regions and was not consistently related to improved outcome, even after adjustment for the numbers of extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) (BW &lt;1000 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The risk-adjusted mortality rate was lower in regions with 4.3 compared with 2.7 neonatologists per 10,000 live births (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99); additional increases did not further reduce the risk of death, suggesting that the supply of neonatologists in most regions was adequate or possibly excessive, and inadequate in some. However, the effect of the regional distribution of neonatologists on proliferation of smaller NICUs (associated with higher mortality) or on neonatal morbidity is unknown.</p><p>The increasing availability of fetal therapy centers across the United States has the potential to affect regional perinatal mortality rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital malformations, including syndromes and chromosomal abnormalities, account for approximately 20 percent of neonatal deaths. These conditions are associated with higher rates of fetal death, preterm birth, and FGR. Congenital anomalies occur in 3 percent of live-born infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Timely and accurate prenatal diagnosis can reduce morbidity and mortality from congenital anomalies by modifying perinatal management. More importantly, timely and accurate prenatal diagnosis of fetal structural defects, followed by termination of anomalous pregnancies, substantially decreases the neonatal mortality rate (NMR). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Effect of prenatal diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other maternal characteristics are associated with increased neonatal mortality, and are similar to risk factors for fetal death. These include age less than 20 years or more than 40 years, late or no prenatal care, unmarried status, smoking, and lower education level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perinatal-mortality/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15710414\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, reducing preterm birth would decrease infant morbidity and mortality. Although there are potential interventions to reduce the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth, many preterm births occur in women with no known risk factors, in whom preventive intervention is not feasible. Prevention of spontaneous preterm birth is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preterm birth: Risk factors and interventions for risk reduction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Additionally, periconceptional and gestational <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> intake prevents many fetal anomalies, and therefore has the potential to further decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H1089579148\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Folate deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality rates in the perinatal period are used to evaluate the outcome of pregnancy and monitor the quality of perinatal (prenatal and neonatal) care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of standard terminology facilitates comparisons of mortality rates among states and countries.
