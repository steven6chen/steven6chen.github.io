Most children undergo evaluation for a febrile illness before their third birthday, and nearly one-third of pediatric outpatient visits are for fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In children 3 to 36 months of age, the diagnosis of fever is based upon core temperature, which is measured most accurately rectally. The history of an elevated temperature recorded at home should be considered equivalent to that taken in a medical facility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management#H538370912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management&quot;, section on 'Site and method of measurement'</a>.)</p><p>Fever of 39&deg;C (102.2&deg;F) or higher is the threshold above which evaluation for a source of occult infection, including urinary tract infection (UTI), may be warranted in children with no obvious infectious source on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although high fever may require additional evaluation, low grade fever does not exclude the possibility of a serious bacterial infection and careful assessment of all clinical findings should be used to determine further care. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Occult sources of infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Prior to the conjugate vaccine era (ie, 1990 for <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b Hib, and 2000 for <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>), the risk of bacteremia was shown to increase with higher body temperatures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, evidence is lacking for whether the height of fever correlates with the rate of bacteremia in the post-conjugate vaccine era. Although one large, prospective observational study published since wide availability of conjugate vaccines found that body temperature was not an accurate marker for the presence of serious bacterial illness in children, the patient population in this study included infants younger than 3 months of age, children older than 36 months of age, and patients with an identifiable cause on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, this study does <strong>not</strong> inform the approach to infants and young children, 3 to 36 months of age with fever without a source.</p><p>The majority of children with fever have either a self-limited viral infection or a recognizable source of bacterial infection. However, research in the 1970s identified a population of well-appearing febrile young children who had occult bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that some of these children went on to develop serious focal bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, septic arthritis, periorbital cellulitis, and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although laboratory testing identified a group of children at an increased risk for occult bacteremia, many who were not bacteremic received presumptive treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics while awaiting definitive blood culture results. The introduction of vaccines to Hib and pneumococcal disease has dramatically lowered the incidence of occult bacteremia since the publication of these studies, and, as a result, changed the issues facing the clinician who is evaluating a young child with fever. However, these early studies still help inform the approach to children who are under- or unimmunized.

However, some experts consider two doses of PCV7 or PCV13 sufficient to prevent invasive <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> infection. Patients who have not received the booster recommended at 12 to 15 months of age for Hib and either PCV7 or PCV13 are also considered to be at much lower risk of bacteremia.

Most young children with fever have an infectious etiology. The source of fever may be a recognizable bacterial or viral illness. In a study of a large cohort of children 3 to 36 months of age presenting to a primary care provider with a febrile illness, clinical findings of a presumed bacterial illness was diagnosed at the initial encounter in 56 percent of children, almost 90 percent of whom had otitis media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A specific viral infection (eg, croup, bronchiolitis, varicella, roseola) was identified in an additional 4 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similarly, 6 percent of 21,216 children 3 to 36 months of age with fever &ge;39&deg;C seen in the emergency department of an urban tertiary care children's hospital had a recognizable viral syndrome, 47 percent had fever without a source (FWS), and 47 percent had a specific bacterial infection requiring antibiotics or chronic illness (eg, immunocompromised state, central line) that affected the fever evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Serious bacterial infectious syndromes that occur in children 3 to 36 months of age include meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, septic arthritis and cellulitis. In one series (prior to the introduction of Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines) of 996 febrile children less than 36 months of age, &lt;1 percent had meningitis, 10 percent had focal soft tissue infections, and 30 percent had pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Such infections are usually bacterial, although the majority of children who are well-appearing and have no identifiable source of infection have a nonspecific self-limited viral illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].

However, a reliable physical examination in a young child can be a challenge. In an observational study, radiographic pneumonia was found in 20 to 30 percent of highly febrile young children (&lt;5 years) without clinical evidence of pneumonia but with a white blood cell count (WBC) <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

This association between leukocytosis and pneumonia remains strong, even in the post-conjugate pneumococcal vaccine era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in these reports was significantly influenced by demographic factors, such as sex, age, race, and circumcision status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76804 \">table 1</a>).

The low incidence of UTI among circumcised boys supports the practice of not routinely obtaining a catheterized urine specimen for culture in febrile, circumcised boys over 6 months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among highly febrile boys (ie, temperature &ge;39&deg;C or 102.2&deg;F) who are 3 to 24 months with no source of infection, the probability of UTI is 10 to 25 percent in uncircumcised and 2 to 4 percent in circumcised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The highest prevalence is found in younger boys. Furthermore, bladder catheterization is an uncomfortable, invasive procedure that many parents might prefer to avoid if their child's probability of disease is less than 5 percent. Thus, our practice is to evaluate for UTI in uncircumcised males &le;12 months and circumcised males &le;6 months. Some investigators suggest that high fever (ie, &ge;39&deg;C or 102.2&deg;F) without a source is sufficient justification for urine studies on the first visit in all highly febrile boys between the age of 3 and 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Some investigators suggest that high fever (ie, &ge;39&deg;C or 102.2&deg;F) without a source is sufficient justification for urine studies on the first visit in all highly febrile uncircumcised boys between the age of 3 and 24 months. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract infection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine collection techniques in infants and children with suspected urinary tract infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For girls &gt;24 months of age, uncircumcised boys &gt;12 months of age and circumcised boys &gt;6 months of age with FWS, all of whom have been completely immunized and are otherwise healthy, we do <strong>not</strong> suggest routine laboratory evaluation. In addition, these children should not receive presumptive treatment with antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, urinalysis and urine culture should be obtained in those at high risk for UTI.
