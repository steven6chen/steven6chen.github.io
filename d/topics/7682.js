Subsequent studies have identified many of the genes responsible for &quot;Mendelian&quot; diseases, conditions that follow a clear familial pattern. However, diseases inherited in a Mendelian fashion (eg, Huntington disease and cystic fibrosis) are rare. </p><p>More recently, the Human Genome Project has generated growing interest in genetic contribution to &quot;complex&quot; diseases. Such diseases combine some familial predisposition with a large environmental contribution. Examples include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, cancer, and obesity.</p><p>This topic will discuss the principles and clinical applications of genetic association studies in the elucidation of the genetic basis for common diseases with complex genetic components. Additional discussions of modes of inheritance and a glossary of genetic terms are presented separately.

Instead of seeking association between traditional risk variables (eg, hypertension) and disease outcomes (eg, stroke), a genetic association study looks for an association between a genetic variable and a specified condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H903496082\"><span class=\"h2\">Single nucleotide polymorphisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic variable most commonly studied is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced &quot;snip&quot;). A SNP is a base pair change that occurs in at least 1 percent of the population. SNPs are not clearly deleterious, in contrast to mutations, which occur less frequently and generally have an adverse effect on protein function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3229563817\"><span class=\"h2\">Study design</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual study design for association studies is case-control or nested case-control, where controls are selected from the general population. Other designs, using family-based data (eg, pedigrees, parent-offspring trios, or sibling pairs) are becoming less popular due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient sample size and the need for specialized statistical methods for analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidate gene approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Earlier gene association studies employed a &quot;candidate&quot; gene approach in which a genetic variant of interest was selected on the basis of the known biology of a disease. The genetic variant may be of interest because of its presumed biologic function, or association with a disease in previous studies. In this approach, one or a small number of known variants are genotyped, usually by PCR methods, in a number of cases and controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genome-wide approach (GWAS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS, pronounced &quot;gee-wass&quot;) test hundreds of thousands of genes simultaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54220\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54220 \">figure 1</a>). GWAS use microarray technology, which &ldquo;arrays&rdquo; a large series of test sequences on a solid surface. Technological advances with microarrays have enabled researchers to genotype an individual for between 500,000 and 2 million SNPs on a platform no bigger than a microscope slide. </p><p>The principle behind microarrays is that DNA from an individual is hybridized against an array of short oligonucleotide probes (ie, DNA sequences) that are immobilized on a surface (the &ldquo;array&rdquo;). Sequences on the array are chosen to assay the regions of the genome with the most variation. If the individual being tested has the DNA sequence that is complementary to a probe on the array, the DNA binds and is detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52164 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>Most GWAS are case-control studies, where a group of cases and a group of separate controls are gathered, DNA is isolated, and microarray data is obtained on each individual. The case-control design facilitates large sample sizes and therefore power, which is particularly important for detecting potentially small genetic effects. GWAS have also been performed using longitudinal cohorts, with cases and controls &quot;nested&quot; within the cohort.</p><p>At the most basic level, the distribution of the three genotypes for each SNP (AA, Aa, aa) is compared between cases and controls using a Chi-square test. This is repeated over and over for each of the 500,000 or more SNPs on the array. As human genetic variation is increasingly catalogued, for example in databases such as &quot;Hap Map&quot; and &quot;1000 Genomes,&quot; this information can be used to impute genetic variants that were not directly measured by the microarray. In other words, the 500,000 to 2 million SNPs that are directly assayed are used to make a best guess on the other SNPs that were not measured, often yielding up to 6 million SNPs or more to test for association. With reference panels such as the HRC (<a href=\"http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/&amp;token=qb2eot8BkfUYyBHKKvgkz/gnfNw2IIXmiFOReFlLClIaKMHGCjPoBg/cGwpl/PCIk/56y9wR0eb4AyNfVuNfSA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2902\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Haplotype Reference Consortium</a>), imputation can yield almost 40 million SNPs per person.</p><p>These association studies have exploded in number in the medical literature. Between 2007 and 2009, GWAS identified nearly 1000 SNPs associated with a range of human traits and common diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By March 2011, that number had risen to almost 4000 SNPs for over 200 conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. GWAS represented 3 percent of all genetic association studies reported in 2003 (24 studies); this number rose to over 12 percent in 2010 (1010 studies) and has continued to rise, with 1569 GWAS publications covering 11,115 hits for 866 diseases catalogued by August 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Despite the issue of &quot;missing heritability&quot; (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Missing heritability'</a> below), GWAS have had some notable successes identifying genes of large effect. An example is the relationship between a complement factor H (CFH) polymorphism and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-clinical-presentation-etiology-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Age-related macular degeneration: Clinical presentation, etiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>). This polymorphism is involved in regulation of the alternate complement pathway that results in increased inflammation. Individuals with one allele coding for a histidine substitution for tyrosine in position 402 of the CFH protein (CFH Y402H) are at increased risk for AMD. Meta-analysis indicates a possible multiplicative model in that each copy of the C allele at this locus (coding for histidine) increases the risk of AMD by approximately 2.5-fold compared to the T allele (ie, the TC heterozygote group has an odds ratio [OR] for AMD of 2.5 and the CC homozygote has an odds ratio of approximately 6 relative to the TT genotype group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626606\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF COMPLEX TRAITS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Common disease-common variant hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic assumption regarding genetic determinants of complex disease is that common variants in many genes will each lead to a small rise (or fall) in the risk of disease, and that the overall risk of disease is determined by the combination of multiple variants and environmental exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) chosen for inclusion on microarrays are usually the more common variants in the population.</p><p>A competing theory is &quot;common disease-rare variant,&quot; in which it is anticipated that most common diseases will be due to multiple rare variants (&lt;1 percent), perhaps even unique mutations. If this is the case, GWAS would be less useful, because they are designed to reveal associations that occur commonly; and one would need to move to whole genome sequencing to detect rare variants associated with a disease. The technology for whole genome sequencing is advancing quickly, and it is anticipated that this technology will become competitively priced, and hence more common, in the near future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In reality, the dichotomy between common and rare variants is not absolute, and results from one type of association will likely complement the other. As an example, sequencing of the cystic fibrosis gene revealed that one major allele, delta F508, accounts for 67 percent of disease in Europe, but the remainder is due to hundreds of rarer disease <span class=\"nowrap\">alleles/mutations</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the last few years, GWAS have led to the successful identification of many genes involved in complex disease, such as coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, bipolar disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>]. These studies largely support the hypothesis that multiple genes, each conferring small relative risks (ie, 1.2-1.8), collectively contribute to increased disease risk. Other GWAS results have shed light on the pathogenesis of a disease process (eg, the role of melatonin in type 2 diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Missing heritability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite many successes, GWAS have not explained as much of the variance in complex traits as was originally expected. Heritability studies look at the variance in a trait and use family relationships (eg, twins and siblings) to partition how much of the variance is due to genetic factors and how much is due to environmental factors. As an example, studies have estimated that height is 80 to 90 percent &quot;heritable,&quot; but GWAS and meta-analyses of GWAS on height have turned up more than 40 genes, accounting for less than 5 percent of the variance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].This discrepancy between the numerator (amount of heritability explained from GWAS SNPs) and denominator (amount of total heritability from <span class=\"nowrap\">family/population</span> data) has been termed &quot;missing heritability&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. </p><p>There are several hypotheses about what may account for the &quot;missing heritability&quot;:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the variation may be explained by rare alleles that will only be detected by whole genome sequencing, rather than SNPs. However, results from next-generation sequencing studies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=next-generation-dna-sequencing-ngs-principles-and-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications&quot;</a>) do not appear to be finding any major new genetic associations or explaining further heritability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In many cases the rare variants discovered have been &quot;tagged&quot; by common variants, and the extra sequencing has not revealed much additional information. Debate remains about whether rare variants are effectively tagged by common variants or whether they are independent. This debate is made more confusing by the finding that the answer depends on which measure of linkage disequilibrium is used, as different measures can give conflicting answers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the variation may be explained by copy number variants (CNVs). CNVs are polymorphisms that consist of deletions or duplications of whole segments of DNA, spanning at least 1000 bases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although CNVs can show association for some diseases where SNPs have not yielded any signal (eg, autism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], it seems unlikely that common CNVs will explain most of the unaccounted heritability for the majority of complex traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. An investigation of the association of CNVs with eight complex diseases found that most CNV signals were in areas that had already been highlighted by SNP associations, and most CNVs were &quot;tagged&quot; by SNPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview#H16722199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;, section on 'Copy number variations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current methodology may not be adequate to detect <span class=\"nowrap\">gene/gene</span> interactions (epistasis). This is particularly true if each genetic variant alone shows no effect but shows an effect in the presence of the other variant. Modelling indicates that <span class=\"nowrap\">gene/gene</span> and higher order interactions could account for missing heritability, but would not have been detected due to insufficient sample size in the studies to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heritability may also be accounted for by epigenetic changes (eg, methylation of DNA, modification of histone proteins). There is increasing evidence that these non-DNA changes can also be passed on from generation to generation, potentially through various RNAs, challenging the traditional dogma that sperm carries only DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p/><p>Others, however, maintain that there is no &ldquo;missing heritability,&rdquo; arguing that estimates of heritability are complex and may have been interpreted simplistically. High heritability does not necessarily mean genetic determination or genes of large effect, but may reflect a large component of shared environment as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Overestimates of total heritability may have created &ldquo;phantom heritability&rdquo; (ie, presumed genetic contributions that could not be identified even if all causative genetic variants were identified) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This line of argument is supported by ability to explain much of the variance in a trait as long as enough SNPs are evaluated. For example, one model using just under 30,000 SNPs could account for 45 percent of the variance in height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Fitting all genotyped SNPs explains a substantial portion of the heritability for such complex phenotypes as height, body mass index (BMI), von Willebrand factor levels, and QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">JUDGING STUDY VALIDITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is increasingly necessary for physicians to become familiar with GWAS data and how to gauge validity of these studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential biases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple potential biases for case-control studies in traditional epidemiology. The potential for bias is less, though not absent, in genetic studies. In contrast to most environmental exposures, the genetic &quot;exposure&quot; is not chosen by the participant, doesn't vary with age or calendar year, is not subject to recall bias, and is not influenced by the disease or treatment.</p><p>One potential bias that cannot be avoided, however, is survivor bias, in that those who are included in a case-control study are those who have survived the initial &quot;insult&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50171\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50171 \">figure 3</a>). As an example, in a study of stroke, results may differ between a case-control and cohort GWAS if certain genes are associated with initial stroke severity, causing early mortality before recruitment into a case-control study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Validity framework</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many groups have published guidelines for critical appraisal of genetic association studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. One framework, from the &quot;Users' Guides to the Medical Literature&quot; series, asks the following questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the disease <strong>phenotype</strong> properly defined and accurately recorded by someone blind to the genetic information?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have any potential differences between disease and non-disease groups, particularly <strong>ancestry</strong>, been properly addressed?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was measurement of the <strong>genetic variants</strong> (ie, genotyping) unbiased and accurate?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the genotype proportions observe <strong>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</strong>?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have the investigators adjusted for <strong>multiple comparisons</strong>?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are the results <strong>consistent with other studies</strong>?</p><p/><p>The issues raised in these questions are as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Phenotyping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>What may seem like a unique disease (eg, ischemic stroke), may be a heterogeneous group of diseases (eg, large vessel stroke, lacunar stroke, and embolic stroke), or may be variously defined (eg, clinical signs only, or <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MRI</span> imaging confirmation). Investigators may selectively report only the disease definition or subgroup that yields a significant association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, an apparent single disease entity may represent genetically separate but clinically similar diseases (&quot;genetic heterogeneity&quot;), as seen with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Including diseases with different genetic backgrounds may obscure a true genetic association.</p><p>To avoid bias, those who are doing the phenotyping should be blind to the results of the genotyping and vice versa. The possibility of bias is greater for candidate gene studies where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are typed manually in contrast to GWAS in which the genotype identification is automated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Ancestry and comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although genetic association studies are less prone to traditional confounding than other case control studies, there are two potential sources of bias:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethnicity or racial mix &mdash; This particular form of confounding, referred to as &quot;population stratification,&quot; occurs when disease and non-disease populations include a different <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnic/racial</span> mix. If the likelihood of developing the condition of interest varies with ancestry, then any SNP with a different allele frequency between ancestral groups will appear to be linked (spuriously) to the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78339\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78339 \">figure 4</a>).<br/><br/>As with traditional confounders, the way to correct for this is to measure the confounder and adjust for it in the analysis or to stratify the analysis. Ethnic subgroups may be identified by self-report or by statistical analysis of SNPs themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. As an example, a spurious association between the CYP3A4-V polymorphism and prostate cancer in African-Americans disappeared when results were adjusted for additional genetic markers associated with ancestry in the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Comorbidities/associated</span> phenotypes &mdash; An apparent association between a genotype and condition of interest may represent a direct association between the genotype and another condition, with the disease of interest being linked to this other condition. As an example, two GWAS showed an association between type 2 diabetes and a SNP in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/9,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,43</a>]. These studies selected diabetic patients and controls irrespective of their body mass index (BMI); another study that matched diabetic patients and controls on BMI showed no association. Thus, obesity is associated with diabetes and the initial SNP was thought to be linked with diabetes when in fact it was linked with the associated obesity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Accuracy of genotyping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genotyping error is a threat to the validity of genetic association studies. Genotyping errors may arise if there is a problem with the DNA samples or with the technology that is employed to identify alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>DNA samples may differ between diseased and non-diseased participants in ways that lead to inaccuracies in genotyping. As an example, in a GWAS for type 2 diabetes, blood used for the control population was stored from a cohort in 1958 while samples from patients with known diabetes were from the present day. The older blood resulted in genotyping errors that led to false positive SNP associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Genotyping error rates vary widely, from &lt;1 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; rates up to a few percent are common in even the best studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. It is common practice for investigators to cull SNPs that do not have a high call rate (eg, 95 to 98 percent). Call rate refers to the percent of DNA samples that can be genotyped. This increases the validity of the data but does not ensure that the genotype information is correct. The genotype may be misidentified as, for example, when one of the alleles in a heterozygote is harder to identify than the other, resulting in a heterozygote being mislabeled a homozygote. Checking for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium may be one way of detecting genotyping problems. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the same way that most continuous variables in medicine observe a normal distribution, most allele distributions observe what is called Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). This describes the steady state where there are no selective forces (eg, mutation, inbreeding, selective survival) acting on a particular locus or gene. The Hardy-Weinberg law states that if there are two alleles (named A and a) at a particular locus, with frequency p and q respectively, then after one generation of random mating, the genotype frequencies of the AA, Aa, and aa groups in the population will be p<sup>2,</sup> 2pq, and q<sup>2,</sup> respectively. Given that there are only two alleles possible, A or a, then:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>p + q = 1,</p><p/><p>and</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>p<sup>2</sup> +2pq + q<sup>2</sup> = 1.</p><p/><p>HWE is commonly used as a quality measure. It has become general practice, in a genetic association study, to check whether the allele frequencies at a particular SNP observe HWE proportions. Results are considered to be consistent with HWE when the p-value is &lt;0.05. HWE calculators are available online [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. For a cohort study, HWE should be tested in the whole study population, whereas for a case-control study, it should be tested in the controls, since these are supposedly representative of the general population.</p><p>However, HWE is non-specific and may be insensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Genotyping error and population stratification are two of many factors that may upset HWE proportions. Other factors that may affect HWE include new mutations, inbreeding, or a selective advantage of one allele over another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple comparisons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual p-value for judging statistical significance in traditional epidemiological studies (0.05) is intended for a single comparison. The &#160;05 threshold means that a result as extreme or more extreme than the one seen will occur by chance once in 20 times; this is taken as low enough to not be chance and to indicate a significant association. However, if one is looking at 100 SNPs, then by chance alone one might expect 5 SNPs to reach this threshold; in fact there is over a 99 percent chance that at least one will reach this threshold.</p><p>In GWAS in which 1 to 40 million SNPs are tested simultaneously, the possibilities for false-positive are countless. The current consensus is that for such large scale studies, a p-value in the range of 5x10<sup>-8</sup> (in contrast to the usual 5x10<sup>-2</sup>) should be considered the threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Some have argued that a simple Bonferroni correction for 10<sup>6</sup> comparisons is overly conservative given that the tests are not independent; the finding of linkage disequilibrium (LD) means that the tests are correlated. A review has summarized the various approaches to determining the correct threshold, including techniques that account for LD, false-positive report probability, false discovery rate, and Bayesian methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These various methods all suggest a threshold between 10<sup>-7</sup> and 10<sup>-8</sup>, and hence the original threshold of 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> remains widely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is essential that studies replicate their results, given the large potential for false positive signals. This is commonly done by repeating the study in different populations.</p><p>There is a growing movement to combine GWAS results using meta-analysis. Most of the genetic associations between SNPs and complex diseases are small in magnitude, and therefore even sizable studies may fail to detect underlying associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Meta-analysis improves the identification of replicable associations and increases precision by increasing power. This is illustrated by studies in various conditions such as Crohn disease and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p>The HuGE Net website lists many of the meta-analyses performed to date and also hosts the HuGE Navigator, where one can find out what single studies, genome-wide association studies, meta-analyses, and synopses are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/4,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,56</a>].</p><p>Replication can also take the form of functional studies in vitro or in animal models. Demonstration by cell culture or mouse mutagenesis that genetic variants can lead to difference in protein level or function can provide powerful support for the effect of genetic variants. Follow-up studies can also provide evidence to support an initial GWAS result, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidate gene association studies that focus on a few genetic variants that are near the site of the initial GWAS locus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fine mapping studies, involving a denser set of SNPs around the initial GWAS locus or involving resequencing of the entire locus to pick up rare variants</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETING GWAS RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigators usually report the magnitude of a genetic association using traditional measures of association: relative risks (RRs) in cohort studies, odds ratios (ORs) in case-control studies, and hazard ratios (HRs) in survival analyses that take account of the timing of events.</p><p>Understanding the magnitude of the risk depends on the genetic model involved. For dominant variant alleles (producing a protein isoform that dominates function), the presence of even one copy (ie, heterozygosity) will result in maximal increase in risk. For recessive variant alleles, both alleles must be present to result in an increase in risk (ie, heterozygotes will not show an increase in risk). In both cases, a single RR, OR or HR describes the magnitude of the association.</p><p>If the effect of a variant allele is additive, then there is a &quot;dose-response&quot; effect: its presence in one gene will lead to an increase in risk, while its presence in both genes will lead to a further increase. There are two possible ways to calculate this further increase: one is to take the square of the risk (variably called the log-additive, per-allele, or multiplicative risk model), and the other is to take two times the risk (called the linear additive model). Recent work in diabetes indicates that most associations seem to follow the log-additive model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>It is important to understand that the magnitude of the effect does not necessarily translate into a causal relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the disease. It is possible that the SNP is only a marker for another SNP nearby that is linked (termed &quot;linkage disequilibrium&quot;) and that is the true causal variant. While linkage disequilibrium does not detract from the potential use of the SNP as a clinical marker, it limits the potential to draw pathophysiologic conclusions from the identified SNP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A framework for translating GWAS results to clinical application has been developed and is presented here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the genetic association improve predictive power beyond easily measured clinical variables?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the absolute versus relative genetic effects?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the risk-associated allele likely to be present in my patient?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient likely better off knowing the genetic information?</p><p/><p>These issues need to be addressed thoughtfully and quickly, particularly given the &quot;direct-to-consumer&quot; availability of genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictive power</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of single SNPs in complex disease to date has been small (ie, odds ratios in the 1.1-1.6 range). Therefore, there has been interest in combining the effect of many genes into a genetic &quot;profile&quot; for greater clinical utility.</p><p>As an example, in one study, investigators created a profile of 5 SNPs associated with prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]; they found an OR of 1.6 for those who were homozygous or heterozygous for the risk allele at one SNP, and up to 4.5 for those who were homozygous or heterozygous for the risk allele at 4 SNPs. The greater the number of SNPs in each profile, however, the lower the number of people with that combination; hence the increased magnitude of effect is offset by the small number of people to whom that effect is relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>There are rare examples, particularly in the area of pharmacogenomics, where genetic associations may have clinical applications because of their large magnitude. As an example, a SNP in the thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) gene identifies individuals who are at increased risk of life-threatening hematologic toxicity from the chemotherapeutic agent 6-mercaptopurine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Genotyping this SNP can avoid substantial harm by additional monitoring or substituting an alternative chemotherapeutic agent in those with the high-risk genotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=6-mercaptopurine-6-mp-metabolite-monitoring-and-tpmt-testing-in-patients-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) metabolite monitoring and TPMT testing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most likely short-term clinical application of a genetic association is to provide prognostic information in the context of other known predictors. To be of value, the genetic marker must provide independent predictive power beyond traditional clinical predictive variables (eg, age, sex, smoking status) and beyond easily obtained surrogate measures of familial aggregation, such as family history. This is often not the case, particularly if the genetic polymorphism exerts its effect through a readily measured variable (eg, a gene controlling lipids exerts its effect through increases in LDL).</p><p>For dichotomous (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no)</span> outcomes, there are a number of statistical tools to quantitate how much predictive power the genetic information adds to existing data. One is to calculate the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, an approach often used for diagnostic tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. An ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) on the y-axis against the false positive rate (1-specificity) on the x-axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82175\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82175 \">figure 5</a>). An ROC curve with no greater predictive ability than chance would approximate a straight diagonal line from the origin (0, 0) to the upper right hand corner (1.0, 1.0). The area under the curve (AUC) would be 0.5. The visual representation of a perfectly predictive test would be a line that goes straight up the y-axis to 1.0 and then straight across the x-axis to 1.0 and would have an AUC of 1.</p><p>As an example, the addition of genetic data to a model for prediction of type 2 diabetes did not improve the model fit and resulted in appropriate reclassification of at most 4 percent of people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>However, a high AUC or even an increment in AUC with the addition of genetic variables does not guarantee that the genetic information will be clinically useful. Points along the ROC curve may still correspond to sensitivities and specificities that are too low to be used for screening or prognosis. Furthermore, even if the sensitivity and specificity are high, the usefulness of the genetic variant for classification of risk may be limited due to low allele frequency (ie, only a small proportion of the risk group will be detected or stratified correctly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>In summary:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A very small p-value does not necessarily translate into a useful clinical marker because effect size (RR or OR) may be small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high effect size does not necessarily translate into a clinical useful marker because the AUC may be low.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high AUC does not necessarily translate into a clinical useful marker because the combined sensitivity and specificity may be insufficiently high for screening or prognostication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High sensitivity and specificity may not necessarily translate into a clinical useful marker because the allele frequency may be low.</p><p/><p>These considerations show the difficulty in translating a statistically significant genetic predictor into a clinical useful and accurate clinical classifier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Absolute versus relative effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient's risk of disease is low in the absence of a variant allele, even a 5- or 10-fold increase in risk in the presence of the allele may represent a small absolute increase in risk. Conversely, if the baseline risk is high, a modest increase in relative risk could impact clinical decision making.</p><p>As an example, the Factor V Leiden mutation increases the risk of venous thrombosis by about sixfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, the baseline risk of thrombosis in the general population is sufficiently low (about 0.2 percent) that one would not use genotyping as a population screening test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, the prevalence of Factor V Leiden in patients with venous thrombosis is 12 to 20 percent, and thus testing some patients with established venous thrombosis may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

As an example, while factor V Leiden is relatively common in Caucasians (about 1 in 20 individuals are heterozygotes), it is virtually non-existent in Chinese populations. Hence, genotyping for factor V Leiden is unnecessary in a Chinese individual presenting with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis.

Some gene-disease associations may be restricted to a very select subgroup.

This group, however, only accounts for approximately 5 percent of all breast cancers. Hence, this genetic association is not worth testing for in those who present with the usual, late-onset breast cancer without a strong family history. However, in certain ancestry groups such as Ashkenazi Jews who have a high prevalence of BRCA1 mutations, testing may be appropriate in women with breast or ovarian cancer (<a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootl5u5ItFaoGPJJunOP2mjbo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2902\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.nccn.org</a>).
