It happens when you have too much of a substance called &quot;bilirubin&quot; in your blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31814376\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes jaundice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaundice is usually caused by problems with your liver. The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Problems with the gallbladder or pancreas can also cause jaundice. Rarely, problems with the blood can cause jaundice.</p><p>Problems with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small stones that form inside the gallbladder, called gallstones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy alcohol use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage from medicines, herbal supplements, or illegal drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer</p><p/><p>You can also get jaundice after surgery, if you have certain blood disorders, or if you have a condition called Gilbert syndrome.</p><p>Gilbert syndrome is a common, harmless condition that can run in families. People with this syndrome sometimes get jaundice when they are under stress, take certain medicines, or have an infection. Women with Gilbert syndrome might get jaundice around the time of their period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31814391\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for jaundice?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will give you a blood test to measure the level of bilirubin in your blood. Your doctor might also give you tests to see what's causing your jaundice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31814408\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p>Tests doctors use to find the cause of jaundice might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to take pictures of the organs inside your belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan &ndash; This is a special kind of X-ray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ERCP &ndash; This test involves putting a flexible tube down your throat and taking X-rays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from your liver. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31814423\"><span class=\"h1\">How is jaundice treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments depend on what's causing the jaundice. Your doctor or nurse might recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get plenty of rest &ndash; Ask your doctor or nurse when it is OK to go back to work or school.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid certain medicines &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will talk with you about the medicines you take and tell you which ones to avoid.</p><p/><p>If your jaundice was caused by gallstones, you might also need to take medicines or have surgery to remove your gallbladder. Sometimes the gallstones can be removed during an ERCP test.</p><p>If you have Gilbert syndrome, you will not need to do anything extra to treat your jaundice. Gilbert syndrome does not cause long-term problems on its own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31814438\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gallstones (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-removal-cholecystectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis A (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Liver cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gallstones (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gilbert-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gilbert syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biopsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Liver biopsy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
