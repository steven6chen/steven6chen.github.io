The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of neonatal RDS are discussed separately.

RDS is the most common cause of respiratory distress in preterm infants because lung immaturity is associated with inadequate production of pulmonary surfactant. The incidence of RDS increases with decreasing gestational age, and infants born below 30 weeks gestation are at the greatest risk for RDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn#H86661090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>As RDS is generally due to lung immaturity, the best intervention would be to prevent preterm birth. However, if preterm birth cannot be avoided, RDS may be prevented or its severity decreased with the use of antenatal steroid therapy, early administration of positive airway pressure and, in some cases, exogenous surfactant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Once the diagnosis of RDS has been established, management is a combination of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific interventions that include adequate oxygenation and ventilation and possible administration of exogenous surfactant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General supportive measures to optimize the neonate's metabolic and cardiorespiratory status and reduce concomitant factors that contribute to poor outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90927307\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific interventions are focused on preventing or decreasing the severity of RDS.

ACS enhances maturational changes in fetal lung architecture and biochemistry with increased synthesis and release of surfactant, resulting in improved neonatal lung function. The efficacy and use of ACS in preterm infants are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In our center, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is the preferred modality to provide positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Limited data suggest that nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be a reasonable alternative to nCPAP.</p><p>These less invasive modalities (nCPAP and NIPPV) have replaced intubation and mechanical ventilation as the initial intervention that provides positive pressure to reduce the risk of atelectasis. However, for some patients who do not adequately respond to nCPAP or NIPPV, intubation and mechanical ventilation with PEEP may be needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73111 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1001477015\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal continuous positive airway pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In preterm infants at-risk for or with established RDS without respiratory failure, nCPAP is the initial preferred intervention versus the combined regimen of endotracheal intubation, surfactant therapy, and mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H15315699\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Several systematic reviews have shown that CPAP is more effective with lower mortality and reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) compared with intubation with or without surfactant administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. nCPAP was also associated with a reduction in mortality and the combined outcome of death or mechanical ventilation compared with supportive care with supplemental oxygen without positive pressure support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Follow-up studies at 18 to 22 months corrected age of one of the clinical trials (Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial [SUPPORT study]) included in the above mentioned systematic reviews showed less respiratory morbidity for the group that was assigned to nCPAP and no difference in death or neurodevelopmental outcome between the nCPAP and <span class=\"nowrap\">intubation/surfactant</span> groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>In our center, nCPAP is also used when patients are extubated, as it reduces the incidence of adverse clinical events (apnea, respiratory acidosis, and increased oxygen requirements) and the need for reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1204290752\"><span class=\"h4\">Caffeine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of early administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> therapy has been proposed to enhance the use of CPAP as caffeine is used to increase respiratory drive for infants less than 28 weeks gestation as apnea is a universal finding. Although data are inconsistent, we administer prophylactic caffeine therapy in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) as these patients universally will have apnea of prematurity and are at greatest risk for developing BPD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-apnea-of-prematurity#H874089807\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of apnea of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic use'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Caffeine'</a>.) </p><p>Support for early <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caffeine</a> administration was provided by a multicenter trial of preterm infants (BW between 500 and 1250 g) that founded a lower incidence of BPD for infants who were assigned to caffeine compared with those who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, a subsequent large multicenter observational study reported that early caffeine treatment (within the first week of life) did not reduce the risk of CPAP failure for very low compared with routine use of caffeine for apnea of prematurity for VLBW infants (22 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Subgroup analysis based on birth weights and gestational age categories also did not show a beneficial effect from caffeine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3861912407\"><span class=\"h4\">Failure of CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with neonatal RDS who fail continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (defined as pH below 7.25 or who require oxygen supplementation of an FiO<sub>2 </sub>&ge;0.40) require intubation and administration of surfactant. CPAP failure increases with decreasing gestational age and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This was illustrated in a large cohort of preterm infants that reported failure rates of CPAP of 43 percent for infants born between 25 and 28 weeks gestation, and 21 percent for those born between 28 and 32 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After adjusting for confounding factors, the incidence of death or BPD was increased for infants regardless of gestational age who failed CPAP compared with those in whom CPAP was successful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H813147864\"><span class=\"h4\">Long-term outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>However, the use of CPAP is still associated with long-term morbidity. This was illustrated in an observational Australian study that correlated pulmonary function for extremely preterm survivors (gestational age &lt;28 weeks) at eight years of age with neonatal respiratory care over three time periods (1991 to 1992, 1997, and 2005) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although the use of nasal CPAP increased over the three time periods, there was no improvement in pulmonary function at eight years of age (eg, risk of airflow obstruction). In fact, contrary to expected results, the 2005 cohort with the longest duration of CPAP use had the highest degree of airflow obstruction at eight years of age and greatest risk of BPD. However, interpretation of these results must take in to consideration other temporal factors including the marked decrease in the use of postnatal steroids (which reduces the risk of BPD) in 2005 compared with the other time periods and the higher mortality rate in the earliest time period of 1991 to 1992, which may have reduced the number of survivors at risk for BPD. Other limitations in comparing results across the three time periods included the potential increased duration of CPAP usage in 2005 for other conditions including apnea of prematurity and recurrent episodes of deoxyhemoglobin.</p><p>These findings are consistent with those reported in a neonatal rodent model that demonstrated adverse long-term effects of CPAP and oxygen exposure used to treat recurrent intermittent hypoxia and hyperoxia on airway reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>These data emphasis that clinicians need to follow the criteria used for initiation and discontinuation of CPAP to avoid its overuse and minimize long-term sequelae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73111 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2881195878\" class=\"local\">'Initial neonatal management in the delivery room'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal target oxygen levels for preterm infants&quot;</a>). Nevertheless, as shown above, CPAP remains the preferred intervention for the management of neonatal RDS to the regimen of endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3899759811\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIPPV is a delivery mode of positive pressure ventilation that avoids the trauma of endotracheal placement tube. It augments nCPAP by delivering ventilator breaths via nasal prongs (or nasal mask). As a result, it requires the use of a ventilator, whereas nCPAP is administered through a less costly bubble CPAP device. Limited evidence of moderate quality suggest that the early use of NIPPV is superior to nCPAP as an initial treatment for noninvasive respiratory support for preterm infants with RDS. However, until further data conclusively confirm that NIPPV is more effective and remains comparable in cost and safety, we continue to use nCPAP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn#H1337962454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive oxygen delivery and oxygen monitoring in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>In a systematic review, early initiation of NIPPV compared with CPAP reduced the risk of respiratory failure (relative risk [RR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and intubation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.94) for preterm infants with RDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There was no difference between the two interventions in reducing the risk of BPD (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06). The evidence of the included studies was assessed as moderate due to lack of blinding, which may result in potential bias. The study population for many of these trials included older infants between 34 to 37 weeks gestation who do not have as high a risk of RSD and BPD than more preterm infants (gestational age &lt;32 weeks). Additional larger trials are needed to confirm these results especially in very preterm infants (gestational age &lt;32 weeks) and to assess the safety of NIPPV compared with nCPAP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504939859\"><span class=\"h3\">High-flow nasal cannulae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are increasingly being used to provide positive distending pressure with or without oxygen instead of traditional nCPAP devices. However, a clinical trial reported a higher failure rate when HFNC was used as the primary therapy for neonatal RDS compared with nCPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, pressure delivery is highly variable. As a result, we do not use HFNC as an initial measure to prevent or treat neonatal RDS.

Although there are several different mechanical ventilation modalities, including pressure control ventilation, volume control, and high-frequency positive pressure ventilation, the optimal mode of ventilation to reduce mortality and BPD remains unclear in patients with RDS who require mechanical ventilation. Based on the available literature, the initial ventilatory mode for preterm infants with RDS used in our center is synchronized volume-targeted ventilation. Target tidal volumes for volume guarantee are set at 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> with permissive hypercarbia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> 50 to 55 mmHg with pH &ge;7.2). Endotracheal tube leaks are minimized by optimizing tube position and size. We do not routinely use high-frequency ventilators in treating neonates who require respiratory support, because this mode of ventilation does not add any significant benefit over the less costly and easier to operate conventional ventilators. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation in neonates&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the choice of ventilator, the goal is to use settings that minimize volutrauma, barotrauma, and oxygen toxicity, thereby reducing the risk of BPD, but still reach the target oxygen saturation and PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels, discussed in the next section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4162017641\"><span class=\"h4\">Target oxygen saturation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of target oxygen saturation is to set a range so that both hypoxia and the excess use of oxygen can be avoided.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H23056267\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary air leak'</a> below.)</p><p>Other complications from intubation include subglottic stenosis and postextubation atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Esophageal and pharyngeal perforations rarely occur and may be confined to the mediastinum or extend into the pleural cavity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23056267\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary air leak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary air leaks are common acute complications of RDS with a reported incidence of approximately 6 percent in low birth weight (BW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g). Air leaks are due to the rupture of an overdistended alveolus, and may occur spontaneously or arise from positive pressure due to mechanical ventilation. The air from the ruptured alveoli dissects along the perivascular connective tissue sheath. This dissection can move toward the hilum, resulting in a pneumomediastinum, or into the pleural space, producing a pneumothorax. Less commonly, air may dissect into the pericardial space, subcutaneous tissue, or peritoneal space, causing pneumopericardium, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumoperitoneum, respectively. In the preterm infant, the perivascular connective tissue is more abundant and compliant, allowing air trapping in the perivascular space, resulting in pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE).</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of each of these pulmonary air leak disorders are discussed elsewhere in the program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23056274\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchopulmonary dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the main chronic complication of RDS. Despite improvements in the management of RDS, the incidence of BPD is still substantial. The etiology of BPD is multifactorial. Inflammation, caused by volutrauma, barotrauma, oxygen toxicity, or infection, plays an important role in its development. This is compounded by the premature lung's structural and functional immaturity, including poorly developed airway support structures, surfactant deficiency, decreased compliance, underdeveloped antioxidant mechanisms, and inadequate fluid clearance.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, prevention, and management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23056281\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the major cause of respiratory distress in preterm infants. The management to prevent and treat RDS is a combination of specific interventions to increase pulmonary surfactant levels, provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and general supportive care to optimize the neonate's metabolic and cardiorespiratory status and reduce concomitant factors associated with poor outcome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive general care is provided to all preterm infants. It includes provision of a thermal neutral environment, optimal fluid balance and avoidance of fluid overload, maintenance of adequate perfusion, and provision of adequate nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H23056221\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific initial interventions are based on gestational age and the initial respiratory status of the infant within the first hour after delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73111 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15315699\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend a course of antenatal corticosteroids in any pregnant women below 34 weeks gestation at high risk for preterm delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on '22+0 to 33+6 weeks'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend the initial use of noninvasive positive pressure in preterm infants with a strong respiratory drive (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In our center, nasal continuous positive pressure airway pressure (nCPAP) is used. Alternatively, positive pressure may be delivered using nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (See <a href=\"#H1001477015\" class=\"local\">'Nasal continuous positive airway pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3899759811\" class=\"local\">'Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend administration of exogenous surfactant for preterm infants with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) requirement of &ge;0.40 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If surfactant therapy is given, it should be administered within 30 to 60 minutes after delivery for optimal effect. Three natural surfactant preparations are commercially available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59110 \">table 1</a>). There are no clear data comparing the efficacy of these different preparations, and the choice of surfactant is based on the preference of the clinical staff caring for these patients and availability at the site of care. (See <a href=\"#H23056094\" class=\"local\">'Surfactant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If surfactant is administered, we suggest the following subsequent management approach, based on the patient's response to the initial dose as determined by arterial blood gas measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73111 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15315699\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with an FiO<sub>2</sub> requirement of &lt;0.30, strong respiratory drive, and an arterial pH &gt;7.25 are extubated and placed on nCPAP or NIPPV. If patients fail extubation, they are reintubated and additional doses of surfactant are added.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with an FiO<sub>2</sub> requirement of &ge;0.30 remain intubated, and repeat surfactant doses are administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with respiratory failure who require intubation and mechanical ventilation, ventilatory settings are used that minimize volutrauma, barotrauma, and oxygen toxicity to minimize the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), but still reach target oxygen saturation and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Oxygen toxicity'</a> and <a href=\"#H2963059239\" class=\"local\">'Choice of ventilatory mode'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications are often due to therapeutic interventions, including placement of arterial catheters, supplemental oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and the use of endotracheal tubes (ETT). The most common complications include ETT complications (eg, misplaced ETT and subglottic stenosis), pulmonary air leak, and BPD.
