Patients may present with the classic symptoms of renal colic and hematuria. Others may be asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms such as vague abdominal pain, acute abdominal or flank pain, nausea, urinary urgency or frequency, difficulty urinating, penile pain, or testicular pain. </p><p>Primary care clinicians need to be alert to the possibility of nephrolithiasis and its consequences to decide upon a diagnostic approach, therapy, and the need for referral to a urologist. These issues will be reviewed here. The epidemiology of nephrolithiasis and subsequent evaluation of such patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The first kidney stone and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eighty percent of patients with nephrolithiasis form calcium stones, most of which are composed primarily of calcium oxalate or, less often, calcium phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The other main types include uric acid, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and cystine stones. The same patient may have a stone that contains more than one crystal type (eg, calcium oxalate and uric acid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There are different theories regarding calcium stone formation, and the different stone types may have different initiating events. Stone formation occurs when normally soluble material (eg, calcium, oxalate) supersaturates the urine and begins the process of crystal formation (eg, calcium oxalate crystal). For some calcium stones, particularly calcium oxalate, it appears that an important initiating event occurs in the renal medullary interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Calcium phosphate crystals may form in the interstitium and eventually erode through the renal papillary epithelium, forming the classic Randall's plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate crystals may then deposit on top of this nidus, remaining attached to the papilla. Calcium phosphate stones might also form initially in dilated ducts of Bellini and then grow out into the urinary space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of struvite, cystine, and uric acid stones is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystine-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystine stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of nephrolithiasis is influenced by urine composition, which can be affected by certain diseases and patient habits. For calcium oxalate stones, urinary risk factors include higher urine calcium, higher urine oxalate, and lower urine citrate and dietary risk factors such as a lower calcium intake, higher oxalate intake, higher animal protein intake, lower potassium intake, higher sodium intake, or lower fluid intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78303 \">table 1</a>). High intake of vitamin C has been associated with a higher risk of stones in men but not women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Dietary risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>There are numerous other factors potentially associated with an increased risk of stone formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of prior nephrolithiasis. The rate of stone recurrence is 10 to 30 percent at three to five years among patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. A higher recurrence rate of approximately 15 percent at one year, 35 to 40 percent at five years, and 50 percent at 10 years was found in another study and was higher in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The first kidney stone and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a>). This variability is due, in part, to differences in sensitivity of different types of imaging modalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a family history of stones have an increased risk of nephrolithiasis. This was demonstrated in a report from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which found a greater than twofold increased risk of stones among individuals with a positive family history compared with those without such a history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, a strong family history of nephrolithiasis in siblings can suggest the presence of rare inherited forms of nephrolithiasis, such as Dent disease (a hypercalciuric form of nephrolithiasis), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, and cystinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The diagnosis of cystinuria is suspected if the pathognomonic hexagonal cystine crystals are seen on urinalysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56834 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dent-disease-x-linked-recessive-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dent disease (X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystine-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystine stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of stones increases in individuals with enhanced enteric oxalate absorption, often in the setting of malabsorption (eg, gastric bypass procedures, bariatric surgery, short bowel syndrome). Studies suggest that even patients with &quot;modern&quot; bariatric surgery excrete higher levels of oxalate and have increased saturation of calcium oxalate salts than typical stone formers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A prospective trial of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery demonstrated a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion and increase in the relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate, suggesting an increased risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less common causes include frequent upper urinary tract infections (eg, as a result of spinal cord injuries) and use of medications that may crystallize in the urine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Drug-related nephrolithiasis has also been reported in children receiving prolonged <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crystal-induced acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stone disease is more common in individuals with diabetes, obesity, gout, and hypertension. Excessive physical exercise (including marathon running) may increase crystalluria and, possibly, the risk of stones in predisposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>], but more typical physical activity is not associated with higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Studies suggest that changes in lifestyle and obesity have significantly increased the incidence of stones in women, thereby changing the previous gender ratio of male to female stone formation from 3:1 to 1.3 to 1.6:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low fluid intake is associated with increased stone risk. The type of fluid taken in may be important, although data are sometimes conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Type of fluid'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A persistently acidic urine (pH &le;5.5) promotes uric acid precipitation and leads to the formation of uric acid stones. An acidic urine is seen in chronic diarrheal states in which bicarbonate loss and volume depletion lead to a concentrated acid urine or with other metabolic defects, including gout, diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/30,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35-39</a>]. In addition to having acidic urine, patients with gout and these other metabolic defects may have increased uric acid excretion, but higher urine uric acid excretion is less important than the persistently acidic urine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Struvite stones only form in patients with an upper urinary tract infection due to a urease-producing organism such as <em>Proteus</em> or <em>Klebsiella</em>. Classic symptoms of nephrolithiasis are uncommon. The diagnosis is suggested in a patient with recurrent urinary tract infections, mild flank pain, or hematuria, who has a persistently alkaline urine pH (&gt;7.0), often with magnesium ammonium phosphate crystals in the urine sediment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54594\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54594 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may occasionally be diagnosed with asymptomatic nephrolithiasis when an imaging exam of the abdomen is performed for other purposes or when surveillance imaging is done in those with a prior history of stones. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-first-kidney-stone-and-asymptomatic-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The first kidney stone and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The asymptomatic phase is more likely to persist in those who have never had a clinical episode of renal colic. A study of 107 patients with asymptomatic stones, for example, found that almost 70 percent remained symptom free during the 31 months of follow-up; a linear association was noted between the development of a symptomatic event and the number of previous stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients occasionally present after having passed gravel or a stone. Patients who form uric acid stones frequently describe passing gravel, but uric acid stones can also produce acute obstruction.</p><p>Symptoms may develop when stones initially pass from the renal pelvis into the ureter. Pain is the most common symptom and varies from a mild and barely noticeable ache to discomfort that is so intense that it requires parenteral analgesics. The pain typically waxes and wanes in severity and develops in waves or paroxysms. Paroxysms of severe pain usually last 20 to 60 minutes. Pain is thought to occur primarily from urinary obstruction with distention of the renal capsule. Consequently, pain due to a kidney stone typically resolves quickly after passage of the stone.</p><p>The site of obstruction determines the location of pain. Upper ureteral or renal pelvic obstruction lead to flank pain or tenderness, whereas lower ureteral obstruction causes pain that may radiate to the ipsilateral testicle or labium. The location of the pain may change as the stone migrates. Many patients familiar with the symptoms are able to predict whether the stone has passed through the ureter. However, stones that are impacted or do not migrate cannot be localized with certainty based on symptoms alone. In addition, a variable location of pain can be misleading and occasionally mimics an acute abdomen or dissecting aneurysm. In some patients with chronic back pain, the diagnosis of acute colic may be difficult without an imaging exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gross or microscopic hematuria occurs in the majority of patients presenting with symptomatic nephrolithiasis (but is also often present in asymptomatic patients). Other than passage of a stone or gravel, this is the single most discriminating predictor of a kidney stone in patients presenting with unilateral flank pain. One study, for example, found that acute, unilateral flank pain, hematuria, and a positive plain film of the abdomen are present in 90 percent of patients presenting to an emergency department with a stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>On the other hand, the absence of hematuria in the setting of acute flank pain does not exclude the presence of nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/4,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,42</a>]. Hematuria is not detected in approximately 10 to 30 percent of patients with documented nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. One factor that may undermine the sensitivity of hematuria is the interval from the onset of acute pain to the time of urine examination. In a retrospective study of over 450 patients with computed tomography (CT)-documented acute ureterolithiasis, hematuria was present in 95 percent on day 1 and 65 to 68 percent on days 3 and 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other symptoms that are commonly seen include nausea, vomiting, dysuria, and urgency. The last two complaints typically occur when the stone is located in the distal ureter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrolithiasis may lead to persistent renal obstruction, which could cause permanent renal damage if left untreated.</p><p>Staghorn calculi themselves do not typically produce symptoms unless the stone results in urinary tract obstruction or infection. However, they can lead to renal failure over years if they are present bilaterally. One study found that deterioration in renal function occurred in 28 percent of patients with staghorn calculi over an eight-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In addition, the density and appearance of a stone on computed tomography (CT) can sometimes be used to predict its mineral composition, which is important in informing treatment. Recent passage of a ureteral stone can also be suggested by imaging findings of pyeloureteral dilatation.

If low-dose CT scan technology is not available, standard-dose abdominopelvic CT or ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder are the two second-line options for initial imaging. The choice between standard-dose CT and ultrasound is determined by considerations of diagnostic accuracy, cumulative radiation dose over time, and the need for treatment planning information should the exam prove positive. Other available, but less frequently used, modalities for evaluating patients with suspected nephrolithiasis include abdominopelvic radiography, intravenous pyelography (IVP), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F112836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112836 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Women who could potentially be pregnant should undergo screening for pregnancy (ie, a urine or serum pregnancy test) before CT, abdominal radiography, or IVP.

This exam is available at most sites. If positive, CT also accurately describes stone size and location for treatment planning. It also provides accurate information on the size and number of other stones in the kidneys. Reasons not to perform a low-dose CT, even if available, are as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the patient is pregnant, an ultrasound is the preferred modality.

Both reliably detect hydronephrosis. In patients who have undergone or are likely to undergo multiple CT exams for nephrolithiasis, and in pregnant women, ultrasound is preferred as it minimizes the cumulative radiation dose over time. However, compared with CT, ultrasound is less sensitive for detecting stones and does not provide reliable stone size or number measurements or localization. Thus, many patients who initially undergo ultrasound will require a follow-up CT to either identify a stone or to guide management. Noncontrast CT is preferred over ultrasound in patients with large body habitus or end-stage renal disease.</p><p/><p>Point-of-care renal ultrasound at the bedside is performed in many emergency departments within the United States. While it is followed by CT for the majority of cases requiring intervention, this does not result in significant care delay. A multicenter trial in which patients were randomly assigned to ultrasonography performed by an emergency department clinician or a radiologist demonstrated that those in the former arm were 2.6 times more likely to undergo CT prior to intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1069381709\"><span class=\"h2\">Noncontrast CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis <strong>without</strong> contrast reliably detects hydronephrosis and demonstrates the best diagnostic performance for nephrolithiasis. For detecting ureteral calculi, sensitivity and specificity of CT using conventional radiation doses is &gt;0.94 and &gt;0.97, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F69052%7ERADIOL%2F72669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69052 graphicRef72669 \">image 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. CT performed using low-radiation-dose protocols (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F112835\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112835 \">image 2</a>) demonstrate comparably high diagnostic accuracies with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95&ndash;0.98) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92&ndash;0.97), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/53,54,57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54,57-60</a>]. Low-dose CT may be less reliable for detecting small stones (&lt;2 mm) and ureteral stones in obese patients (body mass index [BMI] &gt;30). However, sensitivity for detection of stones &gt;3 mm is not altered with dose reduction in nonobese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. For assessing stone size, low- and standard-dose CT exams yield equivalent measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The effective radiation dose of a standard, noncontrast abdominopelvic CT is usually 10 to 12 mSv. By convention, the upper limit of effective radiation dose for low-dose, noncontrast CT is 4 mSv, although most exams fall in the 2 to 3 mSv range, a dose that is slightly higher than that conferred by radiography (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal radiography'</a> below). Imaging is performed on a multidetector CT scanner with 1 to 5 mm slice thickness. Techniques for lowering radiation dose while maintaining image quality include automated tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Intravenous contrast is usually not administered, as it decreases sensitivity for small stones. However, for detecting stones &gt;3 mm, contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates 0.95 sensitivity and is comparable with noncontrast CT. Thus, if a contrast-enhanced CT exam has already been performed, it is useful in detecting clinically significant stones. </p><p>Occasionally, a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT will follow a low-dose, noncontrast CT to differentiate a high-density focus as a ureteral stone rather than a periureteral phlebolith [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Contrast excretion maps the ureteral lumen unambiguously and enables localization of a high-density focus to within, rather than alongside, the ureter.</p><p>Noncontrast CT can usually detect secondary signs of urinary tract obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. The likelihood of detecting these findings varies with the duration of pain. In a report of 227 patients with acute nephrolithiasis, ureteral dilatation was seen in 84 and 97 percent at two and eight hours, respectively, and moderate to severe perinephric stranding in 5 and 51 percent at two and eight hours, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H725865\"><span class=\"h3\">Determination of stone composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appearance, density, and location of a stone on CT may suggest its composition. In general, uric acid, cystine, and struvite stones can usually be distinguished from calcium oxalate calculi. Density is measured in Hounsfield units by drawing regions of interest on CT images. However, CT cannot differentiate the various forms of calcium oxalate (ie, dihydrate versus monohydrate) or distinguish calcium oxalate from calcium phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although magnesium ammonium phosphate and cystine stones are often radiopaque on CT, they are not as dense as stones composed of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate.

DECT utilizes scanners that emit two separate radiograph energy&nbsp;sets to differentiate the attenuation properties of matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/71-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1069380840\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder reliably detects hydronephrosis and does not involve ionizing radiation. It is the preferred initial imaging modality in pregnant patients. In practice settings where low-radiation-dose CT scan technology is not available, ultrasound may represent a reasonable alternative to standard-dose CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast. This minimizes the cumulative radiation dose in patients undergoing multiple episodes of imaging for nephrolithiasis. </p><p>Ultrasound is less sensitive and demonstrates greater diagnostic variability than CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast for the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis. Ultrasound detects 24 to 57 percent of stones seen with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Consequently, a CT is sometimes performed after a negative ultrasound to evaluate for a stone if the index of clinical suspicion remains high. Ultrasound is less accurate than CT at measuring stone size and defining ureteral location. Thus, a positive ultrasound often leads to a follow-up CT to enable treatment planning.</p><p>Ultrasound has been compared with standard-dose abdominopelvic CT for diagnostic performance and cumulative population-level radiation dose. A multicenter trial of 2759 emergency department patients clinically suspected to have nephrolithiasis were randomly assigned to initial imaging with a standard-dose, noncontrast CT, ultrasound performed by a radiologist, or ultrasound performed at the bedside by an emergency clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. After the initial imaging exam, subsequent evaluation and care was at the discretion of the treating clinicians. The key findings from this trial were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity of ultrasound for stone detection was 54 percent (if performed by an emergency clinician) and 57 percent (if performed by a radiologist). The sensitivity of CT was 88 percent.

Sensitivity depends on a number of factors including stone composition, location, and size, as well as patient body habitus and bowel contents. While large radiopaque stones such as calcium, struvite, and cystine stones are seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F62009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009 \">image 4</a>), uric acid stones as well as small (&lt;5 mm) stones, which are radiolucent on abdominal plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB), are often missed. False positives, such as phleboliths and vascular calcifications mistaken for renal stones, also limit the specificity of the exam.</p><p>The effective radiation dose from a single abdominal radiograph is 0.8 mSv.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous pyelography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVP, also called intravenous urography (IVU), involves radiographic imaging of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder before and after the administration of intravenous iodinated contrast.

Because the exam does not involve ionizing radiation, MRI is used to localize the obstruction in pregnant women with hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound. Intravenous gadolinium contrast is usually not administered and should be avoided entirely in the pregnant patient.

Both NSAIDs and opioids had clinically significant analgesic benefits, including the ability to achieve complete short-term pain relief.</p><p>Some relative benefits with NSAIDs may be a lower requirement for rescue analgesia and a lower incidence of adverse effects, particularly nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. In addition, treatment with NSAIDs discourages opiate-seeking patients who may spuriously present with symptoms of renal colic. On the other hand, in patients with preexisting renal disease or severe volume depletion, NSAIDs may interfere with the kidney's autoregulatory response to acute obstruction and induce acute kidney injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A randomized trial suggested that NSAIDs and opioids may be superior to either agent alone.

If the presenting event was the first episode of stone passage, the presence of other stones in the kidney demonstrate recurrent stone formation, and the patient should undergo further evaluation.

However, it remains uncertain whether evaluation and therapy are warranted after the first stone or only in patients with active stone disease, which is defined as the formation of new stones, increase in size of old stones, or the continued passage of gravel. A consensus conference has suggested that a full metabolic evaluation after the first stone should be considered in patients with risk factors for recurrent stone formation, such as a positive family history of stone formation, young age, solitary kidney, nephrocalcinosis, chronic kidney disease or skeletal diseases, history of bowel disease or bowel surgery, certain jobs (such as pilot or frequent business traveler), difficult to treat stones (eg, those with urinary tract abnormalities), and immunocompromised conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

The other main types include uric acid, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and cystine stones. A patient may have a stone with more than one component (eg, a stone containing both calcium oxalate and uric acid). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of nephrolithiasis is influenced by urine composition, which can be affected by certain diseases and patient habits. These are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78303 \">table 1</a>). In addition, patients with a personal or family history of kidney stones and those who have had certain types of bowel surgery (eg, gastric bypass, bariatric surgery, short bowel syndrome) are at high risk for nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may occasionally be diagnosed with asymptomatic nephrolithiasis when an imaging exam of the abdomen is performed for other purposes or when surveillance imaging is done in those with a prior history of stones. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although stones (or gravel) may pass asymptomatically, symptoms may develop when stones initially pass from the renal pelvis into the ureter. The following are the most common symptoms (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain, which varies from a mild and barely noticeable ache to discomfort that is so intense that it requires parenteral analgesics. The pain typically waxes and wanes in severity and develops in waves or paroxysms that are related to movement of the stone in the ureter and associated ureteral spasm (renal colic). Paroxysms of severe pain usually last 20 to 60 minutes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gross or microscopic hematuria occurs in the majority of patients presenting with symptomatic nephrolithiasis (70 to 90 percent). Other than visualization of a stone or gravel, this is the single most discriminating predictor of a kidney stone in patients presenting with unilateral flank pain. On the other hand, the absence of hematuria in the setting of acute flank pain does not exclude the presence of nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hematuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other symptoms that are commonly seen include nausea, vomiting, dysuria, and urinary urgency. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nephrolithiasis may lead to persistent renal obstruction, which could cause permanent renal damage if left untreated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several conditions may mimic renal colic with or without hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is confirmed with imaging of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder to look for stones and signs of urinary obstruction (eg, hydronephrosis). If hydronephrosis is observed, stone size and ureteral location are used to predict likelihood of spontaneous stone passage and to guide management. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast performed using low-radiation-dose scanning technology is the preferred exam for most adults as it reliably detects hydronephrosis and demonstrates the highest diagnostic accuracy for nephrolithiasis. This exam is available at most sites. If positive, CT also accurately describes stone size and location for treatment planning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If low-radiation-dose CT technology is not available, standard-dose, noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis or ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder are the two second-line alternatives. Both reliably detect hydronephrosis. In patients who have undergone or are likely to undergo multiple CT exams for nephrolithiasis, ultrasound is preferred as it minimizes the cumulative radiation dose over time. However, compared with CT, ultrasound is less sensitive for stones and does not provide reliable stone size measurements or localization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with acute renal colic can be managed conservatively with pain medication and hydration until the stone passes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83630\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83630 \">algorithm 1</a>). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to be at least as effective as opiates. Patients can be managed at home if they are able to take oral medications and fluids. Hospitalization is required for those who cannot tolerate oral intake or who have uncontrollable pain or fever. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Acute therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgent urologic consultation is warranted in patients with urosepsis, acute kidney injury, anuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unyielding pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Most stones &le;5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 4 mm in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones &ge;10 mm in diameter. Proximal ureteral stones are also less likely to pass spontaneously.
