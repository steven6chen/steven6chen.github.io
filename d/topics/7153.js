It is almost completely replaced by adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A, HbA) by approximately 6 to 12 months of age, and it amounts to less than 1 percent of total hemoglobin in the adult.</p><p>As a minor hemoglobin in the normal child and adult, HbF has little in the way of clinical relevance in normal physiology. However, it is assuming ever greater importance in certain of the hemoglobinopathies, in which congenital, acquired, and drug-induced increases in HbF have been shown to improve the clinical performance of affected individuals with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. This important subject is discussed in depth separately.

The nearly identical structure of these genes might be related to the selective value placed on maintaining the sequence of gamma-globin chains and the structure of HbF, since functionally critical abnormalities could have an effect on fetal development.</p><p/><p>Gamma-globin chains differ from beta-globin chains in either 39 or 40 amino acid residues, depending on whether a glycine or alanine is present at the gamma codon 136 position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most of the differences lie at the surface of the tetramer and therefore have little functional importance. Two differences in the <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha1/gamma1</span> interface &ndash; gamma 112 threonine, which is a cysteine residue in <em>HBB</em>, and gamma 130 tryptophan, which is a tyrosine in <em>HBB</em> &ndash; might contribute to the resistance of HbF to alkali compared with HbA, and provide the structural basis for measuring HbF by the historical method of alkali denaturation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common polymorphism is found in <em>HBG1</em>, in which threonine replaces isoleucine at codon gamma 75 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This difference might account, in part, for the protective effect of fetal red cells and all erythrocytes with increased HbF against malaria, as a stronger hemoglobin tetramer less readily dissociates into digestible dimers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many other mechanisms of malaria resistance conferred by HbF might also be operative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

This change, which increases the distance between 2,3-BPG inserted in the central cavity and the gamma2 histidine residue, is possibly a secondary contributor to the absence of 2,3-BPG effect exhibited by HbF.

Approximately 20 percent of HbF in the developing fetus has a post-translational modification where the N terminus of gamma-globin is acetylated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The P<sub>50</sub>, or partial pressure at which the hemoglobin molecule is half saturated with O<sub>2</sub>,<sub> </sub>is approximately 19 mmHg in cells with primarily HbF compared with approximately 27 mmHg for HbA-containing cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Solutions of HbF in which organic phosphates have been removed have a P<sub>50</sub> identical to that of solutions of HbA. The differences in oxygen affinity between adult and fetal blood is primarily a result of the failure of HbF to interact with 2,3-BPG due to gamma 143 serine and the acetylation of NA1 valine. The Bohr effect of HbF, through which an increase in blood acidity results in increased release of oxygen from hemoglobin, is 20 percent higher than that of HbA because of gamma 143 serine rather than beta 143 histidine. This helps maximize oxygen transport to the fetus, and contributes approximately half of the oxygen transport between mother and fetus.

The concentration of HbF then decreases with increasing gestational age and is regulated developmentally. As an example, the concentration of HbF in an infant born at 28 weeks gestation is approximately 90 percent and decreases to approximately 60 percent 10 weeks after birth, a value similar to that of full term infant born at 38 weeks.

It is not uncommon for these types of HPFH to coexist with secondary causes of increased HbF, such as sickle cell anemia. Historically, HPFH was classified as either &quot;pancellular&quot; or &quot;heterocellular&quot;; the former is caused by mutations (gene deletion or non-gene deletion of the <em>HBB</em> complex), while the latter is an entity contributed by several genetic HbF genetic determinants (eg, <em>BCL11A</em>). This complex disorder is discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H10880530\" class=\"local\">'HbF in the thalassemias and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancellular HPFH</strong> &ndash; Pancellular HPFH is inherited in a Mendelian fashion; this finding is rare, caused either by large deletions in the <em>HBB</em> cluster or point mutations and small deletions upstream of the <em>HBG</em> genes (non-deletion HPFH). These individuals have elevations of HbF ranging from 10 to 40 percent in heterozygotes, and the HbF is homogeneously distributed among the red blood cells, hence the term &quot;pancellular.&quot; Although the increases in HbF reflect the genotype of the different HPFH mutations, a range of HbF levels has been noted in individuals heterozygous for the same molecular lesion that is likely to be related to co-inheritance of the common HbF genetic variants. (See <a href=\"#H359562845\" class=\"local\">'Major quantitative trait loci'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heterocellular HPFH</strong> &ndash; In contrast to pancellular HPFH, increases in HbF in heterocellular HPFH are usually more modest, and the HbF is unevenly distributed among erythrocytes. Family studies show that heterocellular HPFH tends to be inherited, but the inheritance pattern is not always clear and, in some families, the high HbF determinant is not linked to the <em>HBB</em> complex. These observations led to the detection of the first trans-acting quantitative trait locus (QTL) that affected <em>HBG </em>expression on chromosome 6q. (See <a href=\"#H359562845\" class=\"local\">'Major quantitative trait loci'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The variable increases in HbF, whether primary or as a secondary response to disease, occur on an underlying background of common HbF variation, as observed in healthy adults. This variable persistence of HbF in adults is considered a quantitative trait and constitutes the historical entity of heterocellular HPFH; multiple genes, together with a small environmental component, determine the HbF value measured in any individual. Twin studies show that the HbF in adults is predominantly genetically controlled; genetic factors account for 89 percent of the variability, with the remaining 11 percent accounted for by age, sex (2 percent), and unknown environmental factors. The conglomeration of multiple factors, genetic and environmental, leads to the complex inheritance of the measured HbF values in families and explain the lack of clear Mendelian inheritance patterns in heterocellular HPFH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Drugs that increase HbF production are of interest because they have the potential to ameliorate disease manifestations of hemoglobinopathies caused by beta globin mutations (eg, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased HbF is thought to be one of the major mechanisms by which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> reduces vaso-occlusive complications in sickle cell disease.

This disorder is caused by a quantitative deficiency of beta-globin chains, leading to globin chain imbalance and redundant alpha-globin chains. The free alpha-globin chains are highly unstable; they form intracellular inclusions, interfering with red cell maturation, causing premature death of these erythroid precursor cells, or ineffective erythropoiesis. Affected infants present with severe anemia and failure to thrive within 6 to 12 months of age when the switch from HbF to HbA is almost complete.</p><p>Although almost 300 mutations down-regulating the <em>HBB</em> gene have been identified, functionally these mutations range from those causing a complete absence of beta-globin production (null or beta<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;thalassemia alleles) to those that cause a minimal reduction in beta-globin (mild or beta<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;thalassemia alleles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/143-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">143-145</a>]. While the severity of beta&nbsp;thalassemia is primarily determined by the degree of beta&nbsp;chain deficiency, for any given beta thalassemia allele the severity of the disease can be alleviated by co-inheritance of alpha&nbsp;thalassemia or by co-inheritance of factors that increase gamma-globin&nbsp;chain production and HbF levels. In the latter case, gamma-globin&nbsp;chains combine with the excess alpha&nbsp;globin to form HbF; cells that contain a relatively higher percentage of HbF are protected against the deleterious effect of alpha-globin&nbsp;chain precipitation and premature death and have selective survival. Thus, all individuals with beta&nbsp;thalassemia have variable increases in HbF due to survival of these F cells.</p><p>Certain beta&nbsp;thalassemia mutations, notably those that involve small deletions or mutations of the promoter sequence of the <em>HBB</em> gene, are associated with much higher levels of HbF production than mutations affecting other regions of <em>HBB </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].

A careful study of trans-acting QTL polymorphisms has not been done in these cases, and it is possible that, as with normal individuals and patients with hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia, variations among these elements (and possibly others) that modulate <em>HBG</em> expression might account for some of this variation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359562935\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-gene deletion HPFH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The non-deletional forms of HPFH can be divided into those that are inherited in a Mendelian fashion caused by point mutations in either <em>HBG2</em> or <em>HBG1</em> promoters, or those that are inherited as a complex trait caused by inheritance of a conglomerate of QTLs (<em>Xmn1-HBG2</em>, <em>BCL11A</em>, and HMIP-<em>2</em>; historically referred to as heterocellular HPFH).</p><p>Mutations in the Mendelian non-deletion HPFH include single base substitutions and minor deletions clustered in three regions in the gamma-globin gene promoters: 1) positions -114 to -117; 2) -175; and 3) from positions -195 to -202 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/98,167\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,167</a>]. Exactly why these mutations increase HbF expression has not been fully elucidated. The regions in the gamma-globin gene promoter that harbor the mutations coincide with binding sites for ubiquitous and erythroid-specific transcription factors, and it seem probable that the increased gamma-globin gene and HbF expression involves altered binding of these transcription factors: altered binding of the ubiquitous Sp-1 elements in positions -195 to -202; altered binding of Oct-1 and GATA1 at position -175; altered binding of GATA1 and NFE-3 to the duplicated CCAAT boxes around position -117.</p><p>Heterozygotes for these Mendelian non-deletion HPFHs have HbF levels varying from 5 to 40 percent; mutations at position -175 are associated with the highest HbF increases. HbF shows a pancellular distribution, and the composition of the gamma-globin&nbsp;chains is predominantly G-gamma or A-gamma, reflecting whether the mutation is in the <em>HBG2 </em>or <em>HBG1 </em>genes. Heterozygotes have normal hematologic findings including normal red cell indices; synthesis of alpha and non-alpha globin chains may be balanced or slightly imbalanced with an excess of alpha-globin chains.</p><p>Compound heterozygosity with mutations affecting the <em>HBB</em> allele in <em>trans</em> (eg, sickle cell anemia, beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia) suggest that the combined output of the gamma- and beta-globin&nbsp;chains from the non-deletion HPFH chromosome closely approximate the output from a normal <em>HBB</em> gene. For example, combined output (46.5 percent) of HbA and HbF at 30.7 and 15.8 percent, respectively, is comparable to HbS at 45.4 percent in a heterozygote for -197 C&gt;T <em>HBG1</em> (or <em>HBG1</em>:C. -250 C&gt;T, in terminology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. This reciprocity in <em>cis</em> supports the notion that activation of the gamma- and beta-globin genes depends on competition to access to the <em>cis</em>-acting upstream beta&nbsp;LCR. In reported cases, homozygotes have HbF levels approximately twice that of heterozygotes with normal hemoglobin levels and normal red blood cell indices.</p><p>Small increases in HbF levels have also been described in adults in which the condition appears familial but clearly not inherited in a Mendelian fashion; in other cases, the condition behaves as if allelic to the <em>HBB</em> cluster. These modest increases are frequently lumped together as heterocellular HPFH due to the uneven distribution of HbF. The &quot;unlinked&quot; causes include SNPs associated with increased <em>HBG</em> expression in <em>BCL11A</em> and <em>HBS1L-MYB</em> QTLs, and the possible &quot;linked&quot; forms include <em>Xmn1-HBG2</em> and gene rearrangements such as Atlanta HPFH, and triplicated and quadruplicated gamma-globin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/169,170\" class=\"abstract_t\">169,170</a>].</p><p>The high HbF associated with naturally occurring HPFH mutations of several different varieties has prompted the therapeutic exploitation of these variants using genome editing. The T-C SNP in position -198 of the A-gamma-globin gene promoter (British type HPFH) is typically associated with HbF levels of 8 to 10 percent. When this mutation was introduced into an erythroid cell line expressing HbA, HbF levels rose substantially. The mutation created a binding site for KLF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>]. Some small deletions of critical regions of the <em>HBG</em> promoters, for example a 13 nt deletion of the <em>HBG1</em> promoter that included the CCAAT box, were associated with HbF of about 30 percent that was distributed pancellularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. By recreating this 13 nt deletion first described in the <em>HBG1</em> promoter, it was possible to increase HbF to levels likely to be therapeutic in sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>].

Twenty of these patients with HbF levels of 17.2&plusmn;4.8 percent were compared with 30 controls with HbF levels of 5.0&plusmn;2.5 percent. The frequencies of the HbF QTL alleles <em>BCL11A</em> (rs766432) and <em>HBS1L-MYB</em> intergenic region (rs9399137) were higher in patients with high HbF compared with the controls. There were frequency differences in high and lower HbF cases of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 14.1 kb DNA fragment between <em>HBG1</em> and <em>HBD</em> that<em> </em>included the site of the 7.2 kb Corfu deletion; nevertheless, a definitive explanation for the high HbF in these patients was not found.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Saudi Arabia, sickle cell anemia is concentrated in the Southwestern and Eastern Provinces. Southwestern Province patients have typical African-derived beta S-haplotypes, usually the Benin, and lower HbF levels. Southwestern Province patients differ phenotypically from African American patients, with fewer episodes of stroke, priapism, and leg ulcers, and a higher prevalence of splenomegaly that might be related to differences in HbF levels or co-inherited alpha thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/204-207\" class=\"abstract_t\">204-207</a>]. In 77 patients whose mean HbF was 11.9&plusmn;7.1 percent, a level almost twice that of African Americans, <em>BCL11A </em>was the sole QTL associated with HbF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/208\" class=\"abstract_t\">208</a>]. Despite having African-derived haplotypes, the genetic population structure of these Southwestern Province cases was similar to that of all Arabs. These observations suggested that additional genetic modifiers of <em>HBG</em> expression have evolved in this population that accounts for their higher HbF levels; however, further genetic studies have not identified new candidate genes that might explain this observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/209\" class=\"abstract_t\">209</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and in parts of India, sickle cell anemia is often associated with the AI beta S-haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/182,207,210-214\" class=\"abstract_t\">182,207,210-214</a>]. The phenotype of Indian and Saudi patients seems similar. Although AI sickle cell disease had been considered &quot;benign&quot; and attributed to high HbF, these studies were largely done in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/207,214-216\" class=\"abstract_t\">207,214-216</a>]. Studies in adults have suggested that as HbF falls with maturation, the phenotype of disease changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/217-219\" class=\"abstract_t\">217-219</a>]. In 104 adults with average age of approximately 27 years, 96 percent had painful episodes; 47 percent had acute chest syndrome; 18 percent had osteonecrosis; 17 percent had priapism; 6 percent had overt stroke; 66 percent had cholelithiasis; and none had leg ulcers. This change in phenotype might be due to the continued decline in HbF level from 30 percent in childhood to approximately 15 to 20 percent in adults. As their HbF is distributed heterocellularly, insufficient numbers of F cells protected from polymer-induced damage could be the cause of this phenotypic switch. A study was done to find the genetic basis of high HbF in AI haplotype patients from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In 137 HbS homozygotes with this haplotype, HbF was 19.2&plusmn;7.0 percent (range: 3.6 to 39.6 percent). Patients were homozygous for AI beta S-haplotype-specific elements cis to <em>HBB</em> including core elements of the LCR, <em>HBG</em> promoters, the BP1 binding site and indels; known SNPs in <em>BCL11A</em> and <em>HBS1L-MYB</em> explained less than 10 percent of the variation of HbF; <em>KLF1</em> SNPs associated with high HbF were not present. Sixty-one Saudi AI beta S-haplotype patients with HbS-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia (mean HbF 17.7 percent) were similarly studied. While no associations with HbF were found, the small sample size precluded definitive findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/220\" class=\"abstract_t\">220</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A putative ZBTB7A binding motif was found 5' to <em>HBG2 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/221\" class=\"abstract_t\">221</a>]. This motif contained rs7482144, characteristic of the high HbF Senegal and AI haplotypes. All AI haplotype patients were monomorphic for the C allele; homozygosity for minor alleles at rs16912979, rs7119428, and rs7482144, forming a <span class=\"nowrap\">T/A/T</span> sub-haplotype, was exclusive to the AI haplotype. This sub-haplotype might represent a functional cis-acting domain modulating <em>HBG2</em> expression. Rs16912979 in the HS-4 region of the LCR has strong binding signals for GATA1, GATA2, and POLR2A. Patients with the Senegal haplotype are homozygous for the minor allele of rs7482144 but do not have the minor allele of rs16912979. Perhaps this divergence accounts in part for the differences in HbF between Senegal and AI haplotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/222\" class=\"abstract_t\">222</a>]. Although it is likely that cis-action regulation plays a major role in HbF gene expression in the AI haplotype, mechanistic and functional studies are required to prove this relationship.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourteen Saudi adults with the AI haplotype, one-half with high HbF and one-half with low HbF, underwent whole genome sequencing. An association was found between variants in <em>ANTXR1</em>, an anthrax toxin receptor, and HbF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease/abstract/223\" class=\"abstract_t\">223</a>]. This association was replicated in 259 additional Saudi AI haplotype homozygotes. There was no association of these variants with HbF in 970 HbS homozygotes with other <em>HBB</em> haplotypes. These variants explained 10 percent of HbF variability compared with 8 percent for <em>BCL11A</em>, and these two genes had independent additive effects on HbF, together accounting for 15 percent of variability. The pattern of <em>ANTXR1</em> expression in erythroid progenitors that synthesized predominantly HbA and those that produced predominantly HbF suggested that this gene was a repressor of HbF expression.
