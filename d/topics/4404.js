Such defects may result from incisional hernia related to multiple abdominal operations, surgical resection of the abdominal wall, necrotizing abdominal wall infections, or therapeutic open abdomen. The component separation technique, which was first described in 1990 for midline abdominal wall reconstruction, is a type of rectus abdominis muscle advancement flap that allows reconstruction of such large ventral defects. The advantages of the component separation technique are that it restores functional and structural integrity of the abdominal wall, provides stable soft tissue coverage, and optimizes aesthetic appearance.</p><p>Component separation technique is reviewed here. Other techniques for ventral hernia repair are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of abdominal wall hernias in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420349695\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large or complex abdominal wall defects may be associated with problems such as chronic back pain, respiratory compromise, and altered body image. Patients with symptoms related to these defects or incisional hernias should ideally be repaired. Whether to repair asymptomatic incisional hernias is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Large or complex abdominal wall defects are a particularly challenging surgical problem. Various methods of abdominal wall hernia repair (simple suture repair, mesh repair) using either open or laparoscopic approaches can be used to manage abdominal wall defects, which are most commonly related to incisional hernia. The relative merits of these hernia repairs are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias#H776002\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;, section on 'Ventral hernia repair'</a>.)</p><p>The component separation technique, which was first described in 1990, is a very effective method for reconstructing large or complex midline abdominal wall defects in a manner that restores innervated muscle function without tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], often without the need for mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Indications for a component separation technique include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repair of large, midline abdominal wall incisional hernias (or open abdomen) that cannot be closed primarily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repair of recurrent, large midline abdominal wall incisional hernias that have failed suture closure or mesh repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of abdominal wall defects resulting from trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] or abdominal wall resection related to infection or malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of giant omphalocele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p>The component separation technique can restore abdominal wall functionality for defects up to 20 cm at the level of the umbilicus. In some patients with extremely large defects, the component separation technique alone may not allow restoration of the abdominal wall without tension. If the defect is too large to allow the flaps to be brought together at the midline, supplemental mesh can be used to bridge the residual defect. (See <a href=\"#H25488810\" class=\"local\">'Component separation technique'</a> below and <a href=\"#H781131\" class=\"local\">'Use of mesh'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias#H779488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;, section on 'Ventral hernias between 1 and 10 cm'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25488672\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relative contraindications to a component separation technique include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive destruction of the components of the abdominal wall &ndash; Compromise of the superior epigastric artery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deep inferior epigastric artery, which are the main blood supply to the rectus muscle flap, is a relative contraindication. Under this circumstance, perfusion of the muscle would rely primarily on collateral circulation derived from the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles, but these vessels are preserved in component separation technique. Successful component separation repair has been undertaken in patients with limited rectus complex violation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contaminated operative field &ndash; Although synthetic and biologic mesh have reportedly been used successfully in the presence of contaminated field, active infection is a relative contraindication to mesh placement. For patients with superficial or deep wound infection following prior hernia repair who have undergone removal of prior mesh, the infection should be fully eradicated before repeat hernia repair is undertaken. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia#H4284549\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26505326\"><span class=\"h1\">HERNIA ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preoperative clinical assessment is the key to determining if a patient with a complex abdominal wall defect is an appropriate candidate for the component separation technique. The maximal defect that can be repaired is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73555 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A careful history and physical examination should seek to identify what components of the anterior abdominal wall remain and whether or not their innervation or blood supply have been compromised by previous incisions. Large portions of the abdominal wall may have been removed or destroyed by tumor resection, infection, or injury. This may be apparent from the surgical history including review of prior operative reports, and the physical examination, although more complex imaging, such as computed tomography of the abdomen or magnetic resonance imaging, may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H780985\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients and particularly those with medical comorbidities should undergo preoperative medical assessment to manage risk factors and optimize their medical status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis &ndash; Most randomized trials evaluating perioperative antibiotics have been performed in patients undergoing inguinal or femoral hernia repair. For inguinal and femoral hernia, a meta-analysis of randomized trials found antibiotic prophylaxis beneficial for the subset of patients undergoing hernia repair with mesh (reduction of surgical site infection [SSI] compared with the control group 2.4 versus 4.2 percent; odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A separate systematic review identified one trial in patients undergoing repair of hernias other than inguinal or femoral hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for reducing the incidence of SSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Given that many patients undergoing component separation repair will require mesh, which cannot be known for certain in advance, we administer prophylactic antibiotics for all patients. Appropriate antibiotic choices are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H1855762523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboprophylaxis &ndash; Thromboprophylaxis is administered according to the patient's risk for thromboembolism. Component separation repair is frequently undertaken in older patients with medical comorbidities and requires between two and four hours of operative time to complete; thus, many patients are at least at moderate risk for thromboembolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithrombotic therapies &ndash; Patients taking medications affecting hemostasis may be at increased risk for wound hematoma. Whether to continue or discontinue these medications before surgery depends on the risk to the patient if the therapy is temporarily withheld. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Medications affecting hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782366\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior abdominal wall consists of both the functional component (ie, the musculofascial layers and the skin) and subcutaneous layers that provide protection from infection as well as sensation and cosmesis. Knowledge of the muscular, vascular, and neural anatomy is essential to performing component separation repair. The anatomy relevant to component separation repair is summarized below and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-of-the-abdominal-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy of the abdominal wall&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H783058\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal wall musculature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The muscles and fascia of the anterior abdominal wall oppose the muscles of the back and regulate intra-abdominal pressure, assist in respiration, support defecation, and are essential for optimal posture. Defects in the anterior abdominal wall may compromise any or all of these functions, and an ideal hernia repair restores all these abdominal wall functions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias#H776002\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;, section on 'Ventral hernia repair'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The functional anterior abdominal wall consists of two medial compartments consisting of the rectus muscles within the rectus sheath and two lateral compartments, each consisting of three musculofascial layers: the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominis muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72219%7ESURG%2F66280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72219 graphicRef66280 \">figure 2A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rectus sheath is formed by the fused aponeuroses of the three muscle layers. Although the rectus sheath architecture differs above and below the arcuate line, the critical point surgically is that the rectus muscle and the anterior rectus sheath are fused at three or four horizontal tendinous insertions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77053 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nerves of the rectus muscle enter the rectus sheath on the posterior surface, laterally close to the fusion of the anterior and posterior sheaths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71423\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71423 \">figure 4</a>). Thus, the rectus muscle can be stripped from its posterior sheath throughout its length, provided the lateral innervation is preserved. The plane between the external and internal oblique muscles is an avascular layer of loose connective tissue. The plane between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles is occupied by the interdigitating neurovascular bundles to the abdominal wall.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H783064\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and subcutaneous tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate blood supply to the skin and subcutaneous tissue is important for reducing incidence and the severity of postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs). The blood supply of the skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the anterior abdominal wall arises from cutaneous vessels such as the superficial inferior epigastric, from perforators arising from the deep epigastric arteries within the rectus sheath, and from branches of the intercostal arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81343 \">figure 5</a>). Elevation of extensive skin flaps can disrupt the perforators arising from the deep epigastric vessels and may lead to ischemia in the midline skin with subsequent infection and dehiscence. (See <a href=\"#H781324\" class=\"local\">'General technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25488810\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENT SEPARATION TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The component separation technique, which is a type of rectus abdominis muscle advancement flap, is an alternative repair technique for large and complex abdominal wall defects that can be accomplished without the need for mesh, although reinforcing mesh may be needed when tension will be excessive or for defects that are too large to be bridged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/1-5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,13,14</a>].

The advantages of the component separation technique are that it can provide a tension-free repair, has sufficient bulk to prevent visceral eventration, and is well vascularized. The rectus flap can be advanced with or without the overlying skin. The intraoperative dissection during component separation must be meticulous to preserve blood supply and innervation of the flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].</p><p>The success of the component separation technique is attributed to the following five characteristics of the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Translation of the muscular layer of the abdominal wall to enlarge the tissue surface area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separation of muscle layers to allow maximal individual expansion of each muscle unit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disconnection of the muscle unit from its fascial sheath envelope to facilitate expansion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of abdominal wall musculature to cover intra-abdominal contents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of bilateral mobilization rather than unilateral advancement for equilibrating forces of the abdominal wall and centralizing the midline</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H781324\"><span class=\"h2\">General technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Component separation is performed in the following manners using an anterior or posterior approach; however, if advancement of the flap to the midline is not sufficient, a secondary release can provide additional advancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3724463753\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior component separation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior component separation involves isolation and division of the external oblique muscle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin and subcutaneous tissues are carefully elevated from the underlying rectus and external oblique fascia, extending from the costal margin cephalad to the pubis caudally and to the anterior axillary line and iliac crest laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50539 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incision is made in the external oblique aponeurosis 2 cm lateral to the border of the rectus and external oblique muscles (ie, semilunar line) and extending from the costal margin to the inguinal ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The external oblique muscle is bluntly dissected from the underlying internal oblique muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76185 \">figure 7</a>), which should result in approximately 5 cm of advancement in the upper third of the abdomen, 10 cm in the midabdomen, and 3 cm in the lower third of the abdomen. Care is taken not to disrupt the neurovascular supply, located in the plane between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles.

This secondary release should produce an additional 2 to 4 cm of flap advancement. Thus, in the middle third of the abdomen, a total of 20 cm of advancement is often possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68977\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68977 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2791618116\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior component separation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterior component separation involves isolation and division of the transversus abdominis muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111584 \">figure 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A generous midline incision is made, followed by removal of old meshes (if present) and a complete adhesiolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior rectus sheath is incised at approximately 0.5 to 1 cm from the medial edge of the rectus muscle.

Large flaps are typically associated with greater risks of wound complications. In a retrospective comparison of 111 patients, wound complications occurred more frequently after anterior component separation than after posterior component separation (48 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Additionally, the anterior technique allows mesh to be placed in an onlay or underlay position, whereas the posterior technique allows a large mesh to be placed in a sublay (extraperitoneal) position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias#H779488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;, section on 'Ventral hernias between 1 and 10 cm'</a>.)</p><p>However, when performed by experienced surgeons, both techniques are effective in bringing midline abdominal muscle advancement, which is essential for proper repair of large, complex abdominal wall hernias. The choice of a procedure, therefore, depends mostly on the experience and education of the surgeon. The anterior technique is more commonly performed since it was first introduced by Ramirez in the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is estimated that the learning curve for one of the posterior techniques, transverse abdominis release (TAR), is approximately 5 cases for those who already perform the Rives-Stoppa repair and approximately 10 to 15 cases for others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H781180\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modifications of the standard component separation technique may be needed due to unexpected or adverse conditions identified during the procedure, such as excess tension on the repair or the presence of a stoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H781131\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of mesh</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Component separation without any reinforcement results in an appreciable recurrence rate. The longest follow-up has been 3.5 years, and it is likely that a longer follow-up period will be needed before it can be definitively determined whether or not mesh should be routinely placed. (See <a href=\"#H420353662\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent hernia'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients in whom the abdominal wall defect is too large and tension on the component separation technique repair will be too great, to the degree the level of contamination allows, we recommend mesh reinforcement of the reconstituted linea alba (or residual defect) based largely on randomized trials demonstrating a benefit of mesh for reducing hernia recurrence rates for <span class=\"nowrap\">inguinal/femoral</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] and standard ventral hernia repairs, and the available limited observational data for component separation repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], The abdominal wall may also appear excessively thin along the site of the external oblique incision, particularly in patients whose abdominal wall is somewhat atrophic. If mesh is used to reinforce the component separation repair, it should probably extend sufficiently far laterally to cover the site of the incision in the external oblique aponeurosis. Otherwise, late defects may present through the site of the incision in the external oblique aponeurosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81116 \">figure 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Absorbable mesh was first described for this purpose, but, subsequently, biologic and prosthetic mesh has been used; however, none of these options are well described in the literature.</p><p>The initial study using component separation technique for closure of abdominal wall defects reported no recurrences in 11 patients followed for 4 months to 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the only randomized trial comparing component separation with and without mesh repair, there were no significant differences in hernia recurrence rates (approximately 50 percent) over a three-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In that study, mesh had to be removed in 38 percent of patients. The authors noted that patients in the component separation group with recurrence generally had small, minimally symptomatic hernias. In a meta-analysis of 15 mostly retrospective studies of autologous large ventral hernia repairs, but including one trial, the hernia recurrence rate was 18.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Three studies reported in the meta-analysis incorporated prosthetic mesh in an onlay fashion in patients who had attenuated fascia. The data in those series were not sufficient to determine the contribution of the mesh, but hernia recurrence rates were lower in those who received mesh, ranging from 4 to 10 percent.</p><p>The mesh can be placed in an onlay or sublay fashion. There are no convincing data supporting the superiority of one approach over the other. However, if the mesh is placed in an onlay position, it may become involved if there is a surgical site infection (SSI), but this position may reduce the potential for mesh complications associated with the sublay position, such as adhesive bowel obstruction or fistula formation. Given these considerations, our preference is for the sublay technique. After a posterior component separation, mesh is usually placed in the retrorectus plane that is already developed with a sublay technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The skin and subcutaneous tissue are not dissected from the rectus sheath. Instead, the external oblique aponeurosis is incised via two separate lateral incisions. The ostomy is then advanced with the rectus flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Another option is posterior components separation with re-siting of the ostomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parastomal-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parastomal hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7144726\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A laparoscopic-assisted (also known as endoscopic) component separation is an alternative to the open technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/20,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,35-39</a>]. Open component separation repair created a large exposed surface area and relatively ischemic skin flaps, which predispose the patient to SSI. The laparoscopic-assisted approach minimizes these problems since it avoids division of the perforators arising from the epigastric vessels. However, a disadvantage of the laparoscopic-assisted component separation technique is that the maximum flap advancement is reduced by 1 to 2 cm per side.</p><p>A systematic review identified five retrospective cohort studies comparing laparoscopic-assisted (endoscopic) versus open component separation repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/component-separation-repair-of-large-or-complex-abdominal-wall-defects/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The incidence of wound complications comprising SSI, skin necrosis, subcutaneous abscess, seroma, skin dehiscence, cellulitis, and fistula was significantly less after laparoscopic-assisted component separation (odds ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.12-0.58). There was no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent hernia between the laparoscopic-assisted and open repair groups (13&nbsp;versus 16 percent). Length of hospital stay was also similar.</p><p>The midline defect is approached anteriorly in a manner similar to open component separation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68208\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68208 \">figure 12</a>). The laparoscopic-assisted technique differs from open component separation repair in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the initial midline incision, skin and subcutaneous tissue flaps are elevated for only a 1 cm margin overlying the rectus sheath to avoid disruption of the perforating vessels from the anterior surface of the rectus muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76703 \">figure 13</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A short incision is made 5 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine.

This space is insufflated, and two more ports are introduced just below the costal margin and 3 cm medial to the first port site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68208\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68208 \">figure 12</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The external oblique aponeurosis is incised in the same location used for an open component separation.

The risk of this complication may be reduced by using a laparoscopic-assisted technique that reduces the extent of the anterior flap and preserves the perforators.

The component separation technique enlarges the circumference of the abdomen by moving muscle layers to cover the fascial defect. Advantages of this technique include restoration of functional and structural integrity of the abdominal wall, provision of stable soft tissue coverage, and optimal aesthetic appearance. (See <a href=\"#H26505312\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The component separation technique can restore abdominal wall functionality for defects up to 20 cm at the level of the umbilicus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73555 \">figure 1</a>). Indications for a component separation technique include the following (see <a href=\"#H420349695\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repair of large, midline abdominal wall incisional hernias (or open abdomen) that cannot be closed primarily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Repair of recurrent, large midline abdominal wall incisional hernias that have failed suture closure or mesh repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reconstruction of defects resulting from abdominal wall trauma or abdominal wall resection related to infection or malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reconstruction of giant omphalocele</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative contraindications to a component separation technique include extensive destruction of the components of the abdominal wall or a contaminated operative field. A careful history including prior operative reports, physical examination, and possibly imaging should seek to identify what components of the anterior abdominal wall remain and whether or not their innervation or blood supply have been compromised by previous incisions. (See <a href=\"#H25488672\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26505326\" class=\"local\">'Hernia assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Component separation is performed in the following manner using an anterior approach; however, if advancement of the flap to the midline is not sufficient, a supplemental posterior approach can provide additional advancement. Modifications of the standard component separation technique may be needed due to unexpected or adverse conditions identified during the procedure, such as excess tension on the repair or the presence of a stoma. (See <a href=\"#H781324\" class=\"local\">'General technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H781180\" class=\"local\">'Modifications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who will have excessive tension on the component separation repair, we use mesh to reinforce the repair, provided there are no contraindications to mesh placement (eg, contaminated operative field). We prefer a sublay technique for mesh placement.
