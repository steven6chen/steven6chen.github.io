The HD virion is composed of an outer lipoprotein envelope made of the surface antigen of the HBV (HBsAg) and an inner ribonucleoprotein structure in which the HDV genome resides. The HDV genome consists of a single stranded RNA which is folded as a rod-like structure through internal base-pairing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63575\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63575 \">figure 1</a>). It is complexed with the only HDV-encoded antigen, the HDAg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>HDAg can elicit a specific immune response in the infected host, consisting of antibodies of the IgM and IgG class (anti-HDV). In HDV infected individuals, the timing of appearance and level of HDV RNA, HDAg, and anti-HDV in serum allow the three HDV-related clinical entities to be discriminated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute HDV superinfection of a chronic HBV carrier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic HDV infection</p><p/><p>This topic will review the diagnosis of HDV infection. The pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations and treatment of HDV are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF HDV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the dependence of HDV on HBV, the presence of HBsAg is necessary for the diagnosis of HDV infection. The additional presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is necessary for the diagnosis of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of serum HDAg</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum HDAg can be detected by microplate-based, enzyme-linked (EIA) or radioimmunoassays (RIA). At present, these assays are not available for clinical diagnosis in the United States.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In acute HDV infection, serum HDAg appears early but is very short-lived and may escape detection if repeated testing is not performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60216 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In one study on 18 patients, for example, serum HDAg was demonstrated in 39 percent of patients with acute <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. HDAg lasts longer when the immune response is slow and weak as in immunodeficient individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In chronic HDV infection, anti-HDV is present in high titers. Thus, HDAg cannot be detected by microwell assays since it is complexed with anti-HDV. Serum HDAg is best detected in this setting by immunoblot assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], since polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions allows separation of HDAg from anti-HDV. Immunoblot assay is very sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] but technically difficult, time- and labor-consuming, and cannot be used for routine detection of HDAg.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of serum HDV RNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HDV RNA can be detected in serum by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>RT-PCR assays have a detection limit of less than 10 genomes per mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. However, the extensive sequence heterogeneity of different HDV isolates makes it difficult to choose suitable primers for the amplification of HDV RNA since only a few conserved regions exist in the HDV genome. Furthermore, the secondary and tertiary structure of the HDV RNA may hamper efficient amplification even of highly conserved regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The best efficiency is obtained by amplifying the C-terminal half of the HDAg-encoding region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A microwell-based EIA using an anti-double-stranded DNA monoclonal antibody to detect HDV amplicons is commercially available in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Novel, automated assays are being established to allow the monitoring of HDV RNA kinetics in the serum of infected patients during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>An interesting application of the RT-PCR assay for serum HDV RNA is the analysis of the different HDV genotypes. Genotyping can be performed by direct sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism of the amplicon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Since the clinical relevance of HDV genotyping is uncertain, its widespread use is at present not recommended. Furthermore, the phylogenetic classification of the various HDV genotypes is currently debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A more detailed discussion of HDV genotypes is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;, section on 'Natural history of chronic hepatitis D'</a>.)</p><p>Sequence analysis of semi-conserved regions of HDV RNA can also be used to detect common sources of infection, such as after intrafamilial or perinatal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of anti-HDV antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total (IgM and IgG) anti-HDV antibodies can be detected by EIAs or RIAs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>). These are the only commercially available assays for the diagnosis of HDV infection in the United States.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total anti-HDV antibody appears usually after four weeks of acute infection in acute hepatitis D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60216 \">figure 2</a>). As a result, its clinical value is limited unless repeated testing is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Nevertheless, a well-documented anti-HDV seroconversion may be the only way to diagnose acute HDV infection in the absence of other markers of HDV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-titer anti-HDV of the IgG class is present in chronic HDV infection. It correlates well with ongoing HDV replication and may help in differentiating current from past HDV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-HDV of the IgM class can be detected by EIAs or RIAs, but these assays are not available for clinical use in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. IgM anti-HDV is transient and delayed if the course of acute hepatitis D is self-limited, but it may be the only serum marker of acute HDV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In patients who progress to chronic HDV infection, which is usually the case in those with HDV superinfection, IgM anti-HDV is brisk and long-lasting. It should be remembered, however, that differentiating between <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection and HDV superinfection in an HBV carrier relies mainly on the detection of high-titer IgM anti-HBc in patients with coinfection.</p><p/><p>IgM anti-HDV is present in high titers during chronic HDV infection, and the titers correlate with the level of HDV replication and severity of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. IgM anti-HDV gradually disappears from serum in patients who have persistent remission after interferon therapy and following liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue markers of HDV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both HDAg and HDV RNA can be detected in liver tissues routinely processed for histopathologic evaluation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDAg can be detected by direct immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining. The detection of intrahepatic HDAg has been proposed as the &quot;gold&quot; standard for the diagnosis of current HDV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, as many as 50 percent of liver biopsy specimens from patients who have been infected for 10 or more years may be negative for HDAg, suggesting that the levels of HDV replication may decrease with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/13,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,27</a>]. In patients who are negative for HDAg, the diagnosis of current HDV infection has to rely on the detection of HDV RNA and high-titer anti-HDV antibodies in the serum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HDV RNA can be detected by in-situ hybridization. However, the techniques involved are too time-consuming, tedious, and difficult for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the dependence of HDV on HBV, the diagnosis of hepatitis D cannot be made in the absence of markers of HBV infection. The diagnosis of HDV infection should be considered in the following clinical situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hepatitis B virus infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with acute HBV infection, testing for HDV coinfection should be considered in those who have risk factors (intravenous drug users and patients from endemic countries) or who present with unusually severe or protracted hepatitis. Patients should be positive for HBsAg and have high titer IgM anti-HBc. However, markers of HBV replication may precede or follow those of HDV. In addition, occasional patients have already seroconverted to anti-HBs if they present during the second phase of biphasic hepatitis. These patients should still be positive for high-titer IgM anti-HBc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Serum HDAg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HDV RNA are usually positive at presentation. If assays for serum HDAg or HDV RNA are not available, repeated testing for anti-HDV (total or IgM) should be performed to document anti-HDV seroconversion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hepatitis of undetermined origin in a chronic HBV carrier</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests for HDV should be considered to rule out acute HDV superinfection in this setting. Since HDV superinfection may occur in previously unrecognized chronic HBV carriers, distinguishing between this condition and acute <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection can be difficult. This distinction is important because of the differences in prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HBsAg is present in both situations, but IgM anti-HBc should be negative in acute HDV superinfection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54793 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made more difficult since HDV superinfection may cause transient suppression of HBV replication, resulting in very low and, rarely, undetectable levels of HBsAg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As in patients with acute <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection, patients with acute HDV superinfection are usually positive for HDAg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HDV RNA in serum at the time of presentation. However, in contrast to acute coinfection, acute HDV superinfection is characterized by persistent detection of HDV RNA in serum and rapidly increasing titers of anti-HDV (total and IgM).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">HBsAg-positive chronic liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests for HDV should be considered in such patients to rule out coexistent chronic HDV infection. This is best achieved by screening for total anti-HDV antibody. The presence of chronic HDV infection can be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for HDAg in liver tissues. Measurement of serum HDV RNA should be performed in patients who are anti-HDV positive but have no detectable HDAg in the liver or to evaluate the indications and effects of antiviral therapy. In chronic HDV infection, markers of HBV replication are usually absent, and the patient is typically HBeAg negative and anti-HBe-positive. However, HDV RNA and HBV DNA may occasionally coexist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">When and how to test for HDV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In countries such as the United States where HDV infection is rare, testing for HDV infection is not necessary in all patients with HBV infection. By contrast, testing should be performed in patients who emigrated from countries with a high prevalence of HDV infection (such as Eastern European countries, Mediterranean countries, and countries in Central America) as well as those who had a history of injection drug use. Patients in countries with high or intermediate HDV endemicity should be tested for HDV infection prior to antiviral treatment.</p><p>Initial testing is often limited to total anti-HDV, which is often the only blood test available. When possible, the diagnosis should be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies for HDAg or by RT-PCR assays for HDV RNA in serum. A negative test for total anti-HDV does not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">HBV/HDV</span> coinfection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52583 \">table 1</a>). Furthermore, HDAg may not be detectable in liver biopsies in patients with chronic HDV infection, particularly during the late stages.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Taylor J, Negro F, Rizzetto M.
