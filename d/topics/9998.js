It is composed of long polymers of a 1-4 linked glucose, interrupted by a 1-6 linked branch point every 4 to 10 residues. Glycogen is formed in periods of dietary carbohydrate loading and broken down when glucose demand is high or dietary availability is low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are a number of inborn errors of glycogen metabolism that result from mutations in genes for virtually all of the proteins involved in glycogen synthesis, degradation, or regulation. Those disorders that result in abnormal storage of glycogen are known as glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). They have largely been categorized by number according to the chronology of recognition of the responsible enzyme defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54417 \">table 1</a>). The age of onset varies from in utero to adulthood.</p><p>Glycogen is most abundant in liver and muscle, which are most affected by these disorders. The physiologic importance of a given enzyme in liver and muscle determines the clinical manifestations of the disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main role of glycogen in the liver is to store glucose for release to tissues that are unable to synthesize significant amounts during fasting. The major manifestations of disorders of glycogen metabolism affecting the liver are hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycogen is the primary source of energy for high-intensity muscle activity by providing substrates for the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The major manifestations of disorders of glycogen metabolism affecting muscle are muscle cramps, exercise intolerance and easy fatigability, and progressive weakness.</p><p/><p>This topic will review liver glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD 0). An overview of GSD is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inherited-disorders-of-glucose-and-glycogen-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two isoforms of glycogen synthase have been described. GYS1 is expressed predominantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and GYS2 is expressed in the liver. Glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD 0, MIM #240600) is caused by a defect in the gene that encodes for liver glycogen synthase (<em>GYS2</em>). Liver glycogen synthase deficiency affects the rate-limiting step in glycogen synthesis. A defect in the <em>GYS1</em> gene is associated with cardiomyopathy and exercise intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A defect in glycogenin-1 (GYG1), a self-glycosylating protein that serves to initiate glycogen synthesis, causes a disorder with a paucity of glycogen in muscle tissues and clinical features similar to GYS1 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A defect in the liver isoform GYG2 due to a microdeletion of the X chromosome in males does not appear to result in any clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver glycogen synthase deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait with reduced penetrance. Mutations in the <em>GYS2</em> gene located at 12p12.2 have been reported in familial cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of liver glycogen synthase deficiency are fasting hypoglycemia, hypoalaninemia, and ketosis and&nbsp;postprandial hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia. Affected children present with morning fatigue and exhibit ketotic hypoglycemia during fasting that responds to a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Rare patients may be identified by incidentally observed hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Mildly affected or asymptomatic individuals have been identified following diagnosis of a clinically affected family member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While there is often improvement in tolerance to fasting, in untreated patients, long-term complications may include short stature and osteopenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver glycogen synthase deficiency is likely underdiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It should be suspected in children with ketotic hypoglycemia after other entities are excluded. In an affected child, typical biochemical findings following a fast are preprandial ketotic hypoglycemia and hypoalaninemia and postprandial hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia. There may be modest elevations in transaminases and hyperlipidemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy. Alternatively, mutation analysis of the <em>GYS2</em> gene can be performed on leukocyte DNA, avoiding the need for liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Other biochemical findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycogen content in liver is low, although not absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycogen synthase activity in liver tissue is low or not measurable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme activity is normal in fibroblasts, which have a different tissue-specific isoform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of liver glycogen synthase deficiency consists of frequent protein-rich meals and avoidance of fasting. Glucose levels can be maintained during sleep in the absence of glycogen degradation by the administration of uncooked cornstarch. Cornstarch is a complex glucose polymer that is slowly digested over a two- to six-hour period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Cornstarch may only be required at nighttime. A dose of 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-glycogen-synthase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-0/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver glycogen synthase deficiency (glycogen storage disease type 0, GSD 0, MIM #240600) affects the rate-limiting step in glycogen synthesis.
