Unfortunately, venous stenosis and, to a lesser degree, arterial stenosis often develop, resulting in inadequate dialysis, extended treatment times, and the potential for access failure. AV access stenosis also has a significant negative effect on the patient's quality of life. The problems resulting from stenosis are frequently associated with pain and discomfort either because of the event or its treatment. The occurrence frequently interrupts treatment schedules, delays medications and meals, necessitates changes in transportation, and adds stress to the patient's life. These problems are greater when thrombosis of the access occurs because this requires emergent treatment. </p><p>The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF-K/DOQI</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI)</span> Practice Guidelines on Vascular Access recommend that all dialysis facilities have a program in place to provide regular assessment of the AV access and hemodialysis adequacy. The goal of this program is to prospectively detect the presence of AV access dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The following definitions are important to this program:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring &ndash; the examination and evaluation of the vascular access by means of physical examination to detect physical signs that suggest the presence of dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance &ndash; the periodic evaluation of the vascular access by using tests that may involve special instrumentation and for which an abnormal test result suggests the presence of dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic testing &ndash; specialized testing that is prompted by some abnormality or other medical indication and that is undertaken to diagnose the cause of the vascular access dysfunction.</p><p/><p>Monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts are reviewed elsewhere.

Diagnostic testing and the outcomes of endovascular intervention for the various AV access lesions are reviewed here. Specific techniques for performing endovascular intervention are discussed separately.

Not every patient referred for diagnostic testing based upon monitoring and surveillance performed at the dialysis facility requires treatment. This evaluation can be adequately performed using a combination of physical examination and ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maturation-and-evaluation-of-the-newly-created-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula#H4242959823\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maturation and evaluation of the newly created hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;, section on 'Further evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula#H606473275\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical monitoring and surveillance of the mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;, section on 'Indications for angiography referral'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts to prevent thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Indications for referral'</a>.)</p><p>If a problem requiring treatment is confirmed, further diagnostic testing involving an angiogram should be performed. Angiography of the dialysis access represents the gold standard for identifying vascular pathology. An angiogram is an integral part and the initiating step for all the interventional procedures performed for maintenance or salvage of an AV access. It is important to note that angiography is not a screening test. It should be used only after AV access dysfunction has been documented with reasonable certainty and only if endovascular intervention is an appropriate treatment for the problem. The indications and contraindications for angiography are basically the same as those of the interventional procedure that is to follow. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2036071698\"><span class=\"h1\">SITES OF STENOTIC LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous stenosis associated with arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis access is an aggressive neointimal hyperplasia that produces a pannus-like lesion that progressively enlarges and encroaches on the lumen of the vessel, increasing vascular resistance and decreasing flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Without intervention, thrombosis eventually typically occurs.</p><p>Stenosis and thrombosis occur more frequently in an AV graft than they do in an AV fistula. The most common site for these lesions in the AV graft is the outflow of the access (ie, venous anastomosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Eighty-five to 90 percent of all cases of AV graft thrombosis are associated with an anatomic lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a review of 2300 cases of AV graft venous stenosis, the following distribution of lesions was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous anastomosis &ndash; 60 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral draining vein &ndash; 37.1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intragraft &ndash; 38.4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central veins &ndash; 3.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding artery &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple locations &ndash; 31.3 percent &#160;</p><p/><p>In the AV fistula, stenosis is seen most often in association with a failure of fistula maturation, the incidence of which has been reported to be in the range of 20 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Primarily for this reason, the most frequently seen site for stenosis affecting an AV fistula is the inflow since the juxta-anastomotic (within the first 2 to 3 cm of fistula) lesion is the lesion most frequently associated with failure of maturation. In one series in which the location of lesions was tabulated, the following distribution was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding artery &ndash; 6 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juxta-anastomotic &ndash; 55 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body of fistula &ndash; 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral draining veins &ndash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>The occurrences of these lesions as a cause of primary AV fistula failure, failure in a mature AV fistula, or failure of an AV graft are discussed in more detail separately.

To qualify for treatment, a stenotic lesion must be determined to be significant, which is defined as a narrowing of the vascular lumen equal to or greater than 50 percent, <strong>and</strong> associated with clinical symptoms, abnormal physical findings, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal blood flow measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of these two, the latter is more important. A stenotic lesion that has no associated pathophysiology does not warrant treatment. The techniques used to perform angioplasty, including types of angioplasty balloons, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H2546942941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for angioplasty of the arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Angioplasty technique'</a>.)</p><p>Although stents can help manage some AV access difficulties, they are sometimes inappropriately used. Patency rates following the primary use of venous stents have been relatively poor. In addition, stents add significant cost and other possible complications. When the costs associated with stenting are considered in the light of the reinterventions that will be required to maintain long-term patency, surgical revision may be more economical. Thus, angioplasty alone should be used as the initial treatment modality for all venous lesions, with stenting reserved for specific indications. (See <a href=\"#H4162403953\" class=\"local\">'Stenting'</a> below.)</p><p>Endovascular AV access management procedures may be classified as either maintenance or salvage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance &ndash; This refers to a procedure performed on an AV access that is functioning in order to improve its function or to prevent a loss of patency.

Some type of anatomic disruption, such as a break or tear, accompanies a successful angioplasty. If only stretching occurs, elastic recoil is likely and will result in inadequate postangioplasty. </p><p>The best evidence relating to the mechanism by which angioplasty resolves hemodialysis AV access stenotic lesions has come from intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies. The walls of normal veins do not generally allow distinction by ultrasound of the individual layers, but with arterialization of the vein that occurs with AV access development, the intima, media, and adventitia do generally become well developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. With IVUS, it is possible to distinguish between lesions represented as soft echoes consisting of intimal proliferation, fibromuscular tissue or lipid, and bright homogeneous (hard) echoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>]. </p><p>Although most studies have looked at arteries, there are a few studies that have evaluated vein lesions associated with AV dialysis access. In a study of 38 consecutive venous lesions, the mechanism of angioplasty was dissection of the lesion in 42 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Vessel stretching was noted in 50 percent, and elastic recoil was also present in 50 percent. A combination of vessel stretch and dissection was observed in 18 percent. Elastic recoil and dissection occurred together in 24 percent of the cases. Elastic recoil was observed in central venous lesions more commonly than with peripheral venous lesions. In another study in which 63 stenotic lesions were examined with IVUS, fracture of the lesion was noted in 71 percent, which consisted of dissection and creation of intimal flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Long-term follow-up was not reported in either of these studies; therefore, correlations with structural injury and long-term patency were not documented. Nevertheless, it would appear that the changes in the vessel wall that occur with a successful angioplasty consist of structural disruption at the lesion site as well as dilation of the vessel. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132590049\"><span class=\"h2\">Judging the success of angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some method must be used to determine that an angioplasty treatment was effective, as many lesions are elastic (or at least relatively so) and recoil after what appeared to initially be an effective angioplasty. Recoil can happen immediately, or it can occur over a period of days. The presence of residual stenosis, defined as stenosis remaining after angioplasty, adversely affects outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. There are several parameters (anatomic, clinical, and hemodynamic) that can be used to judge the success of therapy. All should be applied. (See <a href=\"#H1918434075\" class=\"local\">'Angioplasty mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154614070\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2006 National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF-K/DOQI)</span> Guideline workgroup defined anatomical success as no more than 30 percent residual stenosis remaining (as compared with the adjacent normal vein on imaging) following angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the following studies addressing residual stenosis demonstrate that a more aggressive definition might be used since angioplasty judged as successful (by imaging) by this criterion can still have consequences. We have adopted a more aggressive stance and favor a goal of no residual stenosis on imaging.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 50 successful angioplasty procedures (as defined by the <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI)</span> performed on 32 patients with &gt;50 percent venous stenosis, pullback pressure measurements were obtained from the superior vena cava to the graft to identify hemodynamically significant (&gt;10 mmHg) stenoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Significant pressure gradients from 10 to 27 mmHg (mean of 16 mmHg) were found in 9 of the 50 procedures (18 percent). All significant gradients occurred at sites of previous angioplasty. Repeated angioplasty performed with a larger angioplasty balloon reduced the gradients to &lt;3 mmHg in six stenoses and to 5 mmHg in three stenoses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 330 angioplasty procedures designed to identify predictors of AV graft patency after radiologic intervention, median graft survival was inversely related to the degree of residual stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Median graft survival was 6.9 months for complete resolution of the lesion, compared with 4.6 months when there was a residual stenosis. In addition, median intervention-free graft survival after angioplasty was inversely related to the ratio of the intragraft pressure to systemic systolic pressure following the angioplasty. A similar finding was seen in a study that evaluated outcomes of angioplasty for juxta-anastomotic stenosis of AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 358 AV grafts and 185 AV fistulas, the degree of stenosis postangioplasty and the intervention-free survival were similar in both AV grafts and AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The reason for these early hemodynamic failures is not totally clear; however, they could be related to residual stenosis, elasticity of the lesion, or even a failure to diagnose arterial inflow lesions.

Bare-metal stents, along with covered stents (bare stents with a fabric covering), are the devices most commonly used in the treatment of dialysis vascular access. The reported patency rates following the use of venous stents have been variable. As with angioplasty for AV hemodialysis access, outcomes following stenting depend upon the type of access, site of the lesions, and duration of follow-up. Studies assessing patency rates have small numbers of enrolled patients, often lack controls for comparison, and also use varying types of stents. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, among randomized trials comparing stenting (bare stent or stent-graft) versus angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>], the difference in six-month patency rates was not significant (relative risk 0.77, 95% CI 0.55-1.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The cumulative patency rate is approximately 70 percent at one year but may require aggressive reintervention (eg, thrombolysis, in-stent stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">angioplasty/atherectomy)</span> to manage restenosis. The outcomes relating to angioplasty and <span class=\"nowrap\">stent/stent-graft</span> use are discussed below for typical lesions that occur in hemodialysis arteriovenous access. Although <span class=\"nowrap\">stent/stent-graft</span> results are compared with those of angioplasty, it should be understood that stents are generally being placed for angioplasty failure. (See <a href=\"#H2036071698\" class=\"local\">'Sites of stenotic lesions'</a> above.)</p><p>There have been very few controlled studies comparing stents with stent-grafts in the hemodialysis population; most have compared stent-graft with angioplasty alone. Among observational studies, there is overlap in the reported primary patency rates in series of patients treated with each type of device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/30,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38-41</a>]. Nevertheless, use has trended toward using stent-grafts because the fabric covering of the stent-graft may help limit the development of neointimal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>], which invariably occurs for bare stents and, at times, can occur very quickly. In a multicenter trial, stent-graft placement was compared with angioplasty alone for AV graft anastomotic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Among the 191 patients who completed the study, primary patency of the access circuit was significantly greater for the stent-graft group at 24 months (26.9 versus 13.5 percent). In another trial that randomly assigned 275 patients to stent-grafts or angioplasty for the treatment of in-stent stenosis (after bare stents), primary patency of the access circuit was also significantly higher in the stent-graft group at 12 months (6.2 versus 1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In a similarly designed study, patients treated with a stent-graft had a higher treatment area patency (51 versus 23 percent) and a higher overall graft patency (38 versus 20 percent) at six months. However, there was no difference in the likelihood of graft thrombosis (33 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In other words, graft-stents reduced the restenosis rate but did not prevent graft thrombosis. Because of the substantial difference in the cost of these stents and stent-grafts, clinical judgment is important. For the patient with a limited life expectancy, the economical stent would be a more reasonable choice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2935151200\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In spite of widespread use, the role of endoluminal stenting for the treatment of stenotic venous AV access lesions is unclear.

The use of a larger balloon for repeat angioplasty in the central veins may not be possible, and the consequences of vein rupture are more serious.

Stenosis is defined when the diameter of the anastomosis is less than 50 percent of the diameter of the adjacent normal artery. Stenosis can involve a portion of the venous AV fistula (juxta-anastomotic) or involve a segment of the adjacent artery in either type of AV access. For AV grafts, lesions in this area are not as common as those affecting the venous anastomosis in AV grafts, but they do occur regularly. In a study of 40 patients with AV grafts, 11 patients (28 percent) had 13 arterial inflow lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Ten of the lesions were at the arterial anastomosis, with two also having stenosis in the brachial artery. One patient had two stenoses in the brachial artery. Studies reporting the results of this specific lesion with angioplasty, <span class=\"nowrap\">stents/stent-grafts,</span> or surgery are not available. In the case of anastomotic lesions associated with AV fistulas, they are included in reports of the treatment of juxta-anastomotic stenosis.

Much of this variability relates to the frequency of use of central venous catheters in the population being studied. The true incidence of central vein stenosis is not entirely clear, because only symptomatic cases are generally recognized.

When the brachial vein is transposed laterally, too sharp of an angle can lead to an area of flow turbulence that can ultimately lead to intimal hyperplasia and the development of venous stenosis. Mechanical factors related to the brachial fascia may also contribute. When the course of the vein makes a more gradual transition from its original bed to the new position, problems are less frequent.

In addition, all of the blood flow of a brachial-cephalic fistula goes through the cephalic arch, whereas in a radial-cephalic AV fistula there is the potential for blood flow to divide between the basilic and the cephalic veins. In some instances, all or the majority of flow actually misses the cephalic arch. </p><p>Although angioplasty is the accepted initial treatment of venous stenosis associated with AV access, angioplasty of the cephalic arch is problematic because lesions at this site are more resistant to dilation, complications are more likely, and patency is reduced compared with other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

Higher inflation pressures (&gt;15 atm) were needed in 58 percent of the cases. Rupture occurred in 6 percent of cases (3 of 50), one of which led to fistula loss. The other two cases were salvaged with prolonged balloon inflation or stenting. Primary patency was 42 percent at six months and 23 percent at one year; the median primary patency was five months. Primary assisted patency was 83 percent at six months and 75 percent at one year with a median of three years. An average of 1.6 procedures per year was required per fistula. </p><p>Angioplasty using a cutting balloon has been studied as a method that might offer better results when dealing with resistant stenotic lesions because the microsurgical incisions created by the cutting balloon blades might allow less traumatic vessel dilation using a reduced radial force. In a study of 74 dysfunctional brachial-cephalic AV fistulas, 30 (41 percent) were caused by cephalic arch stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Twenty-five procedures in 17 fistulas were treated using a cutting balloon. In 15, a cutting balloon was used primarily, and in 10 procedures cutting balloon angioplasty was preceded by standard or high-pressure balloon angioplasty. Primary patency rates at 3, 6, 12, and 15 months were 94, 81, 38, and 22 percent, respectively. Assisted-primary patency rates at the same intervals were 100, 94, 77, and 63 percent, respectively.

Unfortunately, one-half of the patients were lost to longer-term follow-up. </p><p>The surgical alternatives for the treatment of cephalic arch stenosis include blood flow reduction, direct surgical repair, and outflow relocation (transposition). Because the abnormalities at the cephalic arch are thought to be related to increased flow, it has been postulated that flow reduction may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In a retrospective study of 33 patients who had undergone two or more instances of cephalic arch stenosis, banding of the fistula to reduce the blood flow rate reduced the need for further intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].

The cephalic arch intervention rate was reduced from 3.34 to 0.9 interventions per access-year over an average follow-up of 14.5 months.</p><p>The direct surgical approach is to expose the cephalic arch, perform a venotomy, and suture a vein patch to widen the vessel at the site of the lesion.

With regard to this procedure, the cephalic vein is dissected proximally to ensure adequate length, and then it is brought through a subcutaneous tunnel and anastomosed to the upper <span class=\"nowrap\">basilic/axillary</span> vein in an end-to-side manner. It should be mentioned that this venovenostomy anastomotic site can develop stenosis requiring treatment, but it responds much better than the cephalic arch lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].

Another surgical alternative in these cases is the creation of a secondary fistula, which represents the treatment of choice for this problem.

The reasons for such variability are not clear but may be related to differences in the age of the AV grafts that were being studied. Unlike stenosis occurring at other sites, these lesions are not related to neointimal hyperplasia. They are the result of the deposition of fibrin, lipid, and cellular debris within the graft. In addition, it is likely that defects in the graft from repeated needle puncture allow for some tissue ingrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. </p><p>Intragraft stenosis is not uniformly distributed. In loop AV grafts, intragraft stenosis occurs primarily on the venous side of the loop.

(See <a href=\"#H3472236968\" class=\"local\">'Referral and diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioplasty uses an intravascular balloon positioned within a stenosis to expand the region. Some type of anatomic disruption, such as a break or tear, accompanies a successful angioplasty. The 2006 <span class=\"nowrap\">NKF-K/DOQI</span> Guideline workgroup defined anatomic success as no more than 30 percent residual stenosis remaining (as compared with the adjacent normal vein on imaging) following angioplasty. In addition, the abnormalities evident in the detection of significant pathology that led to treatment (eg, physical examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">hemodynamic/physiologic)</span> should no longer be apparent following treatment. Our anatomic criteria following angioplasty are no residual stenosis on imaging, rather than a greater amount, given that any amount of residual stenosis is a risk factor for restenosis. (See <a href=\"#H1918434075\" class=\"local\">'Angioplasty mechanism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1132590049\" class=\"local\">'Judging the success of angioplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat intervention is frequently necessary. The expected six-month patency rate following angioplasty for AV access dysfunction should be at least 50 percent. Factors that favor longer patency prior to requiring repeat intervention are not completely known but include angioplasty of an AV fistula, rather than AV graft, and no residual stenosis at the completion of primary angioplasty. (See <a href=\"#H1160583991\" class=\"local\">'Restenosis and repeat angioplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although stents can help manage failed angioplasty and other complications of endovascular intervention, they are sometimes inappropriately used. In addition, the use of stents adds significant cost and the risk of complications. The generally accepted indications for <span class=\"nowrap\">stent/stent-graft</span> placement when treating hemodialysis AV access stenosis are acute angioplasty failure, rapid recurrence, and vein rupture following angioplasty. In general, patency rates following primary venous stenting are relatively low; however, for some lesion sites, the threshold for stent placement is low, given a high risk for complications with repeated angioplasty and lack of surgical access. (See <a href=\"#H4162403953\" class=\"local\">'Stenting'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2954805182\" class=\"local\">'Central vein stenosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are good surgical candidates, we agree with the recommendation of the 2006 <span class=\"nowrap\">NKF-K/DOQI</span> Guideline workgroup that states that if angioplasty of the same lesion is required more than two times within a three-month period, the patient should be considered for surgical revision, as an alternative to placement of a <span class=\"nowrap\">stent/stent-graft</span>. (See <a href=\"#H2435858806\" class=\"local\">'Surgical revision'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2036071698\" class=\"local\">'Sites of stenotic lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes of endovascular intervention for specific lesions are presented above. (See <a href=\"#H896089613\" class=\"local\">'Specific AV access lesions'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vascular Access 2006 Work Group.
