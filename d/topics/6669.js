CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the bone marrow and blood, while the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal (ie, absolute B lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;5000/microL</span> [5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L])</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment is indicated when there are disease-related symptoms or evidence of progression (ie, &quot;active disease&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96185 \">table 1</a>)). Except for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), treatment options for CLL are not curative. The International Workshop Group on CLL (IWCLL) published a revised version of the guidelines for evaluating disease response that were published in 1996 by the National Cancer Institute Working Group <span class=\"nowrap\">(NCI/WG)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99325\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. These efforts in developing standardized criteria for the evaluation of response have also allowed comparison of results from different therapeutic trials.</p><p>The response evaluation and criteria will be reviewed here.

The specific evaluation performed to assess the response to therapy differs depending upon whether the patient is enrolled in a therapeutic research protocol (clinical trial) or is being treated in general practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those treated in general practice, response evaluation should always include a history, physical examination, and complete blood count with differential. The history should include questions regarding constitutional symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fevers, and night sweats. The physical examination should pay particular attention to the evaluation of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although bone marrow biopsy with absence of CLL infiltrates on histology is required to confirm a complete remission (CR), it is not always recommended in general practice as it may not impact management. Bone marrow evaluation is indicated in patients with cytopenias of uncertain cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the above clinical and hematologic parameters are compatible with a CR and the clinician chooses not to perform a bone marrow biopsy, the documented response can be either &quot;partial remission&quot; or &quot;clinical CR, bone marrow biopsy not performed.&quot; This phrasing allows the patient to avoid bone marrow evaluation, limits ambiguity, and allows for more accurate data capture in registry studies or upon enrollment on a future clinical trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those treated as a part of a research protocol, the evaluation includes all that was just discussed. In addition, occult involvement is evaluated using computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Patients should also undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsy two months after all other findings are found to be compatible with CR. Assessment for minimal residual disease is often performed using four to eight color flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. A lymph node biopsy should be obtained if transformation into an aggressive lymphoma is suspected (ie, Richter transformation). Richter's transformation is suspected in patients who develop rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or extranodal sites of disease, systemic symptoms, or elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase. (See <a href=\"#H326376\" class=\"local\">'Minimal residual disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Image-directed biopsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The use of imaging studies is reserved for the research setting because it has not demonstrated a clinical benefit and is unlikely to change the management of most patients. This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis that included 1372 patients receiving initial therapy for CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of the 481 episodes of progressive disease, 77 percent were detected by clinical symptoms or changes in the blood counts. A decision to treat relapsed disease was made based upon the results of CT or ultrasound alone in only two patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPONSE CRITERIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H611062853\"><span class=\"h2\">Response categories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2008, the International Workshop Group on CLL (IWCLL) published a revised version of the guidelines for evaluating disease response that were published in 1996 by the National Cancer Institute Working Group <span class=\"nowrap\">(NCI/WG)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Response is categorized as complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), nodular PR, stable disease, or progressive disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99325\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325 \">table 2</a>). An additional category of clinical remission with minimal residual disease is used in the context of clinical trials.</p><p>These guidelines rely upon surrogate markers of tumor burden (eg, blood lymphocyte count, lymph node size, spleen size) that have predicted clinical benefit in patients treated with traditional chemotherapy agents. Since their publication, it has been recognized that these surrogate markers may not accurately predict clinical benefit in patients treated with newer agents. This realization initiated a Lymphoma Research Foundation-sponsored workshop in May 2011, which culminated in the publication of recommended changes to the response criteria in patients treated with novel agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The marrow should be free of clonal CLL cells by conventional flow cytometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunohistochemistry. If nodules (lymphoid aggregates) are found on bone marrow biopsy, these may represent residual disease (ie, nodular PR) and so should be assessed by immunohistochemistry to determine if they are principally comprised of CLL cells or of lymphocytes other than CLL cells or T cells.

MRD testing uses multicolor flow cytometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to look for small malignant clones in patients who achieve a complete remission following chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. While the sensitivity depends on the technique used, modern assays for MRD can reliably detect approximately one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Those who achieve CR and have less than one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes are considered in complete remission without detectable MRD. </p><p>Clinical trial data suggest that patients who have high levels of detectable MRD have inferior clinical outcomes when compared with those with low levels of MRD or without detectable MRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of data from three trials of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, MRD detection was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A greater treatment effect on MRD correlated with a larger impact on PFS. However, this analysis included not only patients in clinical CR, but also those with obvious residual CLL by cytology. Prospective trials are necessary to determine whether additional therapy to convert a response from a complete remission with MRD to a complete remission without detectable MRD is of significant clinical benefit.</p><p>Conversely, studies are investigating whether MRD can be used to identify patients who may have good outcomes after less therapy.

Among those achieving MRD negativity, there was no apparent difference in progression-free survival according to the time to MRD negativity (after three courses or by the end of therapy) or the number of treatment courses received (three or fewer courses versus more). Randomized trials are needed to verify that no clinical benefit is lost by stopping therapy after achieving MRD negativity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">PR categories</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327183\"><span class=\"h3\">Partial remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A partial remission (PR) requires demonstration of response both clinically and hematologically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99325\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>At least two of these <strong>clinical criteria</strong> must be documented for a minimal duration of two months after the completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in the peripheral absolute lymphocyte count by at least 50 percent from the level prior to therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in previously enlarged nodes by at least 50 percent with no increase in the size of any single lymph node and no new enlarged lymph nodes.

The term nodal response was initially designated for use in trials of B cell receptor and adhesion-related kinase inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idelalisib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">idelalisib</a>). Treatment with these agents commonly results in tumor mobilization from tissues into the peripheral blood characterized by the rapid development of lymphocytosis, often with a concomitant shrinkage of involved lymph nodes. The lymphocytosis usually resolves with continued treatment, but may be persistent. Such patients would be classified as having progressive disease as defined by the IWCLL response criteria, despite an apparent clinical benefit. As such, the term nodal response was created in an attempt to more faithfully predict outcome with these newer agents. For patients receiving a drug associated with tumor mobilization, the label &quot;progressive disease&quot; should be reserved for cases that demonstrate other definitive signs of progression (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly).

These efforts in developing standardized criteria for the evaluation of response allow comparison of results from different therapeutic trials. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those treated in general practice, response evaluation should always include a history, physical examination, and complete blood count with differential. The history should include questions regarding constitutional symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fevers, and night sweats. The physical examination should pay particular attention to the evaluation of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Although bone marrow biopsy is required to confirm a complete remission, it is not always recommended in general practice as it may not impact management. Bone marrow evaluation is indicated in patients with cytopenias of uncertain cause. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Response assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response is categorized as complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), nodular PR, stable disease, or progressive disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99325\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99325 \">table 2</a>). If the clinical and hematologic parameters are compatible with a CR and the clinician chooses not to perform a bone marrow biopsy, the documented response can be either &quot;partial remission&quot; or &quot;clinical CR, bone marrow biopsy not performed.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H611062853\" class=\"local\">'Response categories'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special consideration must be made for patients treated with novel agents, for which the surrogate markers of tumor burden (eg, blood lymphocyte count, lymph node size, spleen size) may not accurately predict clinical benefit. Assessments that incorporate clinical trial experience with these novel agents may help to avoid underestimating their clinical benefit. (See <a href=\"#H327363\" class=\"local\">'Nodal response'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Progressive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsed disease occurs in patients who have previously achieved either a CR or PR but then develop progressive disease after a period of six months or more after last therapy.
