Initial treatment with ECT is also reasonable for patients who prefer it or responded well to it during prior episodes of unipolar psychotic depression.

As an example, a prospective observational study included patients with unipolar psychotic depression (n = 77) or unipolar nonpsychotic depression (n = 176), who received bilateral ECT three times per week, and found that remission occurred in more psychotic patients than nonpsychotic patients (83 versus 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-with-psychotic-features-acute-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].
