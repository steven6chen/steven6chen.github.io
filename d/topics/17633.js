NWTS encourages the use of primary surgical resection <strong>prior</strong> to chemotherapy administration. In contrast, SIOP protocols use a primary chemotherapy approach followed by surgical resection and staging four weeks <strong>after</strong> the administration of chemotherapy. Both treatment approaches have excellent and comparable clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

SIOP trials have reported approximately 1.5 percent of patients treated initially with chemotherapy were found to have benign tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p/><p>The SIOP approach has the following advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative chemotherapy usually reduces tumor volume, and may make surgical excision easier, thus decreasing the likelihood of tumor spillage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This appears to reduce the potential need for local radiation due to spillage of tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SIOP approach incorporates a measure of the in-vivo chemosensitivity of each child's tumor into risk stratification, which has allowed reduction of treatment intensity for children with localized, stage II or III Wilms tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a study from the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCS group), 205 patients with newly diagnosed potentially resectable renal tumors were randomized to immediate nephrectomy, or percutaneous renal biopsy, followed by chemotherapy and then nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-wilms-tumor/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].
