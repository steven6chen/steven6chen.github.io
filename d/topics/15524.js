Cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) became highly prevalent in most developed countries through the 20<sup>th</sup> century; with a lag of several decades, the rise of smoking was followed by epidemic increases in the diseases now known to be caused by smoking, including lung and other cancers, coronary heart disease (CHD), and chronic lung disease. By mid-century, epidemiologic studies provided the initial evidence establishing that smoking caused these diseases. Mounting evidence and authoritative syntheses in the reports of the US Surgeon General soon led to definitive conclusions concerning smoking as a cause of disease. Unfortunately, in the second decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, smoking is on the rise in developing countries, even as it declines in the developed countries that have had some success with tobacco control.</p><p>This topic will focus on the health consequences of SHS in adults. Issues related to SHS exposure to a <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/child</span> and effects of active cigarette smoking are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-risk-of-smoking-and-benefits-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular risk of smoking and benefits of smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of secondhand smoke (SHS) and health has a relatively brief history compared with active smoking, although the irritating nature of tobacco smoke to the nonsmoker has long been chronicled. Some of the first epidemiological studies on SHS and health were reported in the late 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The 2006 US Surgeon General's report uses the term &quot;secondhand smoke,&quot; although the term &quot;environmental tobacco smoke,&quot; originating within the tobacco industry, was used more frequently in earlier reports and discussions on the topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Initial epidemiological investigations focused upon parental smoking and lower respiratory illnesses in infants; studies of lung function and respiratory symptoms in children soon followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The first major studies on SHS smoke and lung cancer in nonsmokers were reported in 1981 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and by 1986 the evidence supported the conclusion that SHS was a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers, a conclusion reached by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the US Surgeon General, and the US National Research Council [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. Subsequently, a now substantial body of evidence has continued to identify new diseases and other adverse effects of SHS, including increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/5,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11-15</a>].</p><p>The 2006 US Surgeon General's Report leaves no doubt that any exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful to human health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The findings on SHS and disease have been the foundation of the drive for smoke-free indoor environments and for educating parents concerning the effects of their smoking on their children's health. As bans are implemented, an increasing body of evidence documents reduction of exposure and benefits for cardiovascular and respiratory health.</p><p>The tobacco industry's campaign to discredit the evidence on active smoking initially and on SHS subsequently is now well-documented, as legal actions against the tobacco industry have led to the release of millions of industry documents. A US Federal Court decision found the tobacco companies to be guilty of fraud and racketeering, citing their actions around SHS as one instance of such activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The industry's actions were attributable to fear of the policy implications of the findings on SHS. The tactics used to discredit the scientific evidence on SHS included the use of consultant experts who raised endless concerns about the data, sometimes without revealing their employment by the tobacco industry; support for meetings and publications speaking to limitations of the evidence on SHS; and more subtle infiltration of scientific organizations and even public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO). Readers of the scientific literature need to be aware that there was an attempt to maintain seeming controversy among scientists even as the evidence mounted and supported converging conclusions by expert panels on the adverse effects of SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Industry websites now acknowledge the conclusions on SHS by public health authorities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS SECONDHAND SMOKE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondhand smoke (SHS) is one of several terms used for the smoke inhaled involuntarily by nonsmokers. The smoke inhaled by nonsmokers is often referred to as &ldquo;secondhand smoke&rdquo; or &ldquo;environmental tobacco smoke.&rdquo; At present, one billion adults worldwide are smokers, implying that SHS exposure is almost unavoidable for children and for the two-thirds of adults who do not smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>SHS is a mixture of sidestream (SS) smoke given off by the smoldering cigarette (or pipe or cigar) and of mainstream (MS) smoke that is exhaled back into the air by active smokers. SS smoke, generated under the lower temperature conditions in the smoldering cigarette, has higher concentrations of many of the toxic compounds found in MS smoke. However, it is quickly diluted as it moves away from the cigarette to contaminate the immediate environment. While there are quantitative differences between SHS and the MS smoke inhaled by the active smoker, there is sufficient qualitative similarity to have warranted concern that the health of nonsmokers may be injured by SHS, just as active smokers are harmed by MS smoke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &ldquo;thirdhand smoke&rdquo; has been used to refer to smoke components deposited on surfaces, along with metabolites of these components generated through oxidative chemistry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There is potential public health impact through dermal or oral absorption of the smoke components and metabolites, which may be carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of secondhand smoke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In environments where smoking takes place, components of tobacco smoke can readily be measured in the air, including small particles in the size range that penetrates into the lung, carbon monoxide, nicotine, and benzene. Concentrations of the smoke components depend upon the number of smokers and their smoking patterns, the size of the space where smoking is taking place, the rate of exchange of the air of the space with outdoor air, and the presence and efficiency of air cleaning devices. The exposures of nonsmokers will also depend upon proximity to smokers, particularly during the time that they are actively smoking. A baby held by a smoking mother might be inhaling dense and virtually undiluted SS smoke, while older children could leave a room if annoyed by the smoking of their parents.</p><p>Measurements of several airborne components of SHS have been made in homes, workplaces, and public places to characterize the contribution of smoking to indoor air pollution. These studies have shown that cigarette smoking is a strong source of small particles in the air, the same size of particles that are regulated in outdoor air by the US Environmental Protection Agency (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, airborne particles less than 2.5 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter). Concentrations of particles in homes with smokers are typically at least double those of homes without smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Nicotine, present as a gas in SHS, can be readily measured in indoor air using either active or passive samplers. Its presence is highly specific for tobacco smoke, as there are no other sources. Abundant nicotine measurements made over the last several decades confirm that SHS has been widely prevalent in the workplace and in homes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A 31-country study showed that median air nicotine levels were 17-fold higher in homes where smoking takes place compared with those without smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Nicotine can also be present on surfaces in rooms where there has been smoking (thirdhand smoke).</p><p>The secondhand smoker also inhales other components of tobacco smoke. Benzene, which causes leukemia, is generated by tobacco combustion and may contribute to the increased risk of leukemia in active smokers compared with nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke is one of the major sources of benzene exposure for nonsmokers, making a contribution to exposure that rivals that from filling a car with gasoline and exceeding the contribution of petrochemical plants in nearby residences.</p><p>Exposure to SHS can also be documented by the measurement of biomarkers, that is, tobacco smoke components or metabolites of these components in body fluids of nonsmokers, including blood, urine, saliva, and also hair. Studies using biomarkers show clearly that SHS-exposed nonsmokers absorb, metabolize, and excrete tobacco smoke components, including nicotine and tobacco-specific carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although small amounts of nicotine may be ingested in certain foods, most of the nicotine and its metabolites detectable in body fluids reflect exposure to active or passive tobacco smoke. In the 31-country study of exposures of women and children to SHS at home, levels of hair nicotine in children living with smokers were about twofold higher compared with those not living with smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Cotinine, the principal metabolite of nicotine, has been the most studied biomarker. Levels of cotinine in nonsmokers previously reached several percent of those in active smokers. In an analysis of blood from a national survey in the United States during the late 1980s, cotinine could be detected in almost the entire sample using a very sensitive assay procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There is strong evidence that SHS exposure is decreasing in the United States, suggesting that these control strategies are having important effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In the 2002 data from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Survey, the proportion of US nonsmokers with cotinine concentrations of 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or greater fell by 43 percent in comparison with data from 1988 to 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2003 to 2004 show a further decrease of 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. NHANES data from 2011 to 2012 continued to show declining prevalence of SHS exposure with an additional 25.3 percent decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In nonsmokers, tobacco-smoke carcinogens have also been shown to be bound to cellular DNA and albumin as adducts, and nonsmokers experimentally exposed to SHS excrete NNAL, a carcinogenic nitrosamine found in tobacco smoke, as do those exposed by living with smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These observations, together with studies of biomarkers confirm the wide extent of SHS exposure and support the plausibility of adverse effects of SHS by demonstrating uptake of tobacco smoke components by exposed nonsmokers. The 2006 US Surgeon General's report concludes that &quot;the evidence is sufficient to infer that exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke causes&hellip; an increased risk for lung cancer&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H774846586\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), which do not involve the combustion of tobacco, generate a vapor that almost always contains nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and that may contain other chemicals, including tobacco-related carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], albeit at far lower concentrations than in tobacco smoke. The nicotine in the vapor could be inhaled by nonsmokers or absorbed across the skin. We have very little information at present on these routes of exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes#H1032354978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;, section on 'Secondhand vapor exposure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF SECONDHAND SMOKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of the health risks of involuntary smoking comes from epidemiological studies, which have directly assessed the associations of measures of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure with disease outcomes. Judgments about the causality of the relationship between SHS exposure and health outcomes are also based upon extensive evidence derived from the biological and toxicological investigation of the health consequences of active smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The literature on SHS and health has been periodically reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/6,10-13,15,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-13,15,31-33</a>]. One review was completed in 2005 by the California Environmental Protection Agency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and another review in 2006 by the office of the US Surgeon General with updating in the 2014 report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Causal conclusions were reached as early as 1986, when involuntary smoking was found to be a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the US Surgeon General [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the US National Research Council [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Each of these reports interpreted the available epidemiologic evidence in the context of the deep understanding of active smoking and lung cancer. In spite of somewhat differing approaches for reaching a conclusion, the findings of the three reports were identical: involuntary smoking is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. This and subsequent causal conclusions have had broad public health impact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In 1986, the reports of the US Surgeon General and the US National Research Council also addressed the then-mounting evidence of adverse respiratory effects of SHS exposure for children. Subsequent reports, including the 2006 US Surgeon General's report, identified further effects of SHS exposure on children, and the more recent reports have classified SHS as causing a number of adverse effects for exposed children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Annoyance and irritation, although not representing an illness or disease, are also firmly linked to exposure to SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/6,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34</a>]. Surveys document discomfort involving the eye and upper airways; confirmatory evidence has been provided by studies involving exposures of volunteers to SHS in chambers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SHS exposure is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. While the doses of carcinogens received from SHS exposure are far less than with active smoking, exposure to SHS can begin in childhood and extend across the full lifespan. A number of studies have shown that SHS is associated with lung cancer in different populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4,7,8,10,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8,10,35,36</a>]. After reviewing the available data, national and international expert panels have all concluded that SHS causes cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4,12,32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,32,37</a>].</p><p>A 2014 pooled analysis of 18 case-control studies found that among never smokers, those exposed to SHS had an odds ratio of lung cancer of 1.31 (95% CI 1.17-1.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among histologic types of cancer, there was a stronger association with small cell lung cancer. Another study estimated that exposure to SHS was responsible for 21,400 lung cancer deaths worldwide in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There appears to be a dose-response relationship between intensity of exposure and relative risk, with spouses, children, and workplace contacts at increased risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spousal exposure &ndash; A 2006 meta-analysis including 52 studies found that the relative risk of lung cancer among nonsmokers who were ever exposed to SHS from the smoking of their spouse was 1.21 (95% CI 1.13-1.30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A 2007 meta-analysis, involving 55 studies, found that women had a 27 percent increase in risk if married to a smoker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood exposure &ndash; Household exposure to SHS during childhood is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children&quot;, section on 'Lung cancer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Workplace exposure &ndash; A 2006 meta-analysis of 25 studies of lung cancer and exposure to SHS in the workplace estimated a pooled relative risk of 1.22 (95% CI 1.13-1.33) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>An association between involuntary smoking and lung cancer is biologically plausible based upon the presence of carcinogens in sidestream smoke and the lack of a documented risk-free threshold dose for respiratory carcinogens in active smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/9,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39</a>]. Furthermore, genotoxic activity, the ability to damage DNA, has been demonstrated for many components of SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Experimental exposure of nonsmokers to SHS results in the urinary excretion of NNAL, a tobacco-specific carcinogen, and living with a smoker also leads to a higher level of NNAL in nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Nonsmokers, including children, exposed to SHS also have increased concentrations of tobacco-related carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>The risk for the development of lung cancer in response to SHS may be influenced by genetics. One study found a significant increase in polymorphisms in the gene glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) among 51 nonsmoking women with exposure to SHS who developed lung cancer compared with 55 nonsmoking women with lung cancer who had no environmental tobacco smoke exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In another population-based study among never-smokers, in those with high SHS exposure, GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms were associated with over a fourfold increased risk of developing lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. GST is believed to play a role in detoxifying carcinogens in tobacco smoke; therefore, mutations which decrease its activity could serve to promote tumorigenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other respiratory tract illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several cross-sectional studies have investigated the association between respiratory symptoms in adult nonsmokers and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. These studies have primarily considered exposure outside the home. Consistent evidence of an effect of passive smoking on chronic respiratory symptoms in adults has not been found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/48-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-54</a>], although the small particles in SHS would be anticipated to reach the airways and alveoli and potentially cause injury. Several studies suggest that passive smoking may cause acute respiratory morbidity (ie, illnesses and symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/55-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-61</a>].</p><p>People with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be at increased risk from SHS exposure. However, experimental studies have not clearly demonstrated a role of SHS in exacerbating asthma in adults. The acute responses of asthmatics to SHS have been assessed by exposing persons with asthma to tobacco smoke in a chamber. This experimental approach cannot be readily controlled because of the impossibility of blinding subjects to exposure to SHS. However, suggestibility does not appear to underlie physiological responses of asthmatics of SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Of three studies involving exposure of unselected asthmatics to SHS, only one showed a definite adverse effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. One study recruited 21 asthmatics who reported exacerbation with exposure to SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. With challenge in an exposure chamber at concentrations much greater than typically encountered in indoor environments, seven of the subjects experienced a more than 20 percent decline in FEV1.</p><p>Several studies have shown improvement in the status of people with asthma after the implementation of workplace bans on smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/61,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,68</a>]. In Scotland, following the national smoking ban in 2006, the respiratory health of asthmatic and nonasthmatic bar workers improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Exposure to SHS has been associated in cross-sectional investigations with reduction of several lung function measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One observational study found that after adjusting for known risk factors, increased SHS exposure in nonsmokers was associated with increased COPD prevalence and concluded that SHS exposure in multiple settings could have an effect comparable to smoking up to 14 cigarettes per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. However, the findings have not been consistent and methodologic issues constrain interpretation of the findings. Thus, a conclusion cannot yet be reached on the effects of SHS exposure on lung function in adults.</p><p>In a matched case-control study, SHS was associated with chronic rhinosinusitis, particularly at the workplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In a population-based case-control study, exposure to SHS at home was associated with community-acquired pneumonia in nonsmoking adults &ge;65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease and stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to SHS increases nonsmokers&rsquo; risk of cardiovascular disease. While the risk estimates for SHS and coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes vary, most studies show modest increases in risk. Large epidemiologic studies estimate approximately a 20 percent increased risk of coronary disease and coronary death in nonsmokers exposed to SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Pooled relative risks from meta-analyses indicate a 25 to 30 percent increase in the risk of CHD from exposure to SHS, with a dose-response relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,74,75</a>].</p><p>Other studies have found a higher relative risk. Data from the Nurses' Health Study found that compared with women not exposed to SHS, the relative risk of CHD, after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, was 1.58 among women who reported occasional exposure and 1.91 among those reporting regular exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Another study that measured serum cotinine concentration to assess environmental exposure found that after 20 years of follow-up, among men who were nonsmokers, the risk of CHD was increased in those with higher serum cotinine concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Compared with men in the lowest quartile of serum cotinine concentration, the risks in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.45, 1.49, and 1.57, respectively. No consistent association was found between serum cotinine concentration and stroke. The effects of active cigarette smoking on cardiovascular risk are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-risk-of-smoking-and-benefits-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular risk of smoking and benefits of smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies suggest that SHS exposure among nonsmokers with cardiovascular disease is both a common and potentially modifiable risk factor. Between 29 and 40 percent of nonsmokers with cardiovascular disease being seen in inpatient or outpatient settings have detectable serum cotinine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Before-after studies suggest that laws that limit public and workplace smoking may result in a rapid decrease in the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in both smokers and nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. One meta-analysis found that the rate of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction decreased with time (0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.87), following hospitalizations 12 months after implementation of smoking restriction laws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. A review of the evidence by an Institute of Medicine Committee led to the conclusion that bans are causally linked to a reduction in ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Several studies show that exposure to SHS in healthy young volunteers compromises coronary artery endothelial function in a manner that is indistinguishable from that of active smokers, suggesting that endothelial dysfunction may be an important mechanism by which SHS increases CHD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/4,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,83</a>]. A cross-sectional study found that after controlling for some potential confounders, exposure to SHS was associated with increased inflammatory markers including higher white blood cell counts and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine, fibrinogen, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>SHS is also associated with noncardiac vascular disease. For example, a large cross-sectional study of 60,377 women in China found an association between stroke in women and smoking by their husbands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The prevalence of stroke increased with greater duration of smoking and with an increasing number of cigarettes smoked daily. The 2014 US Surgeon General&rsquo;s report concluded that exposure to SHS causes a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of stroke, based on evidence from more than 20 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mounting evidence suggests that active smoking may be a risk factor for diabetes.

The contributions of different microenvironments to personal SHS exposures depend upon the time spent in those environments and the concentrations of SHS in the different locations. The contributions of different microenvironments also depend upon age, sex, and other sociodemographic factors. For children, the home is a dominant locus of exposure, while for adults the workplace and social environments may be significant loci.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has offered policy recommendations to achieve smoke-free environments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Its Framework Convention for Tobacco Control calls for protection of nonsmokers against exposure to SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Although most countries have ratified the Framework Convention, only a small minority of the world population meets the recommended level of protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Control of SHS exposure in the home and elsewhere is discussed in detail separately.

It has clinically relevant consequences, particularly for the health of children, and possibly for adults with chronic respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). From the public health perspective, passive smoking contributes to the population's risk for lung cancer and heart disease. It is a readily controllable form of environmental pollution that can be completely eliminated. A number of situations that may arise in clinical practice and suggested approaches are given below. There are now extensive resources available on the health effects of passive smoking that can be used by clinicians working in public health and clinical domains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung cancer and heart disease risk for adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the 1986 US Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report was released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], Dr. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General at the time, was asked if the causal conclusion with regard to lung cancer meant that nonsmokers should divorce smoking spouses. While divorce is a potential strategy to control exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in the home, there are alternatives, as reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-secondhand-smoke-exposure#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of secondhand smoke exposure&quot;, section on 'The home environment'</a>). Lung cancer in never-smokers is not a rare disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]; there are approximately 10,000 cases annually, of which approximately 2000 to 3000 are estimated to be attributable to SHS. Nonsmokers married to smokers have about a 20 percent greater risk for lung cancer and coronary heart disease (CHD) than those married to nonsmokers. While this increment in risk is relatively modest, it can be readily reduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Workplace exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of adults in the United States are now nonsmokers, and exposure to tobacco smoke in the workplace, if permitted, may be viewed as both an annoyance and a health risk. For the nonsmoker with asthma or perhaps COPD, health care providers can reasonably postulate that the exposure may exacerbate respiratory illness. Fortunately, the majority of workers now report that their workplaces are smoke-free in the United States and in other developed countries.</p><p>If asked about workplace risks from these exposures, health care providers can reasonably reply that the exposure would increase risk to some extent and that it could be reduced or eliminated with a workplace smoking policy.
