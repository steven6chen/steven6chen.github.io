Abuse of older individuals is associated with depression, cognitive impairment, loss of functional capacity, and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Health professionals who take care of elders have an opportunity to impact the health consequences of abuse, as well as a legal and moral obligation to identify victims and intervene when maltreatment is suspected. Health care workers encounter mistreated elders in emergency departments, nursing homes, hospitals, and outpatient settings. It is crucial to be aware of the manifestations of elder mistreatment and how to respond.</p><p>This topic addresses abuse, neglect, and exploitation as defined in civil statutes or governmental regulations. Self-neglect exposes older persons to significant harm and is discussed here as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elder mistreatment is perpetrated by those with an ongoing relationship that involves an expectation of responsibility toward the victim. Abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation by strangers are not considered elder mistreatment unless someone who is expected to be responsible for the victim, such as a caretaker, breaches a duty to protect the elder.</p><p>Definitions vary among jurisdictions and authorities who have written on elder mistreatment. The following is an attempt to consolidate and simplify these definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elder &ndash; Persons 60 or 65 years of age or older (the precise age varies among jurisdictions).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abuse &ndash; Behavior by someone with an ongoing relationship to an elder, and a duty towards that elder, that may constitute:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Willful infliction of physical pain or injury or unnecessary restraint (physical abuse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Willful nonconsensual sexual contact (sexual abuse)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Willful infliction of emotional harm (psychological abuse)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neglect &ndash; Failure of a person to provide for the needs and protection of a vulnerable elder when that person had an ongoing relationship with the elder and a duty to provide for those needs and protection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abandonment &ndash; Desertion of a vulnerable elderly person by a caregiver or caretaker.

Most (excluding Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, Vermont, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and South Dakota) have statutes or regulations specifically providing for protection of older adults from self-neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Community-dwelling elders are protected in all states by state adult protective services agencies (APS). These agencies receive and investigate allegations or complaints, and provide social, legal, medical and material interventions to help the victims.</p><p>Elders in institutional settings in all states and territories are protected by state Long Term Care Ombudsman Programs (LTCOP) that receive complaints and advocate on behalf of long-term care residents. The state LTCOP may have authority to investigate and intervene as needed, or it may refer the case to another agency (an APS agency or licensing agency for the involved facility) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>APS and LTCOP agencies are designed to protect older adults from mistreatment by non-strangers, such as family members, non-family caretakers, or employees of the facility where elderly victims reside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevalence estimates of elder abuse vary widely, depending on definitions, populations, and settings and the means of ascertaining abuse (surveys, self-reports to regulatory agencies, etc). The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report on elder abuse in European countries in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The report estimates that elder maltreatment (involving people aged 60 years and older) affects 4 million older people in Europe annually. With increasing life expectancy, this number is anticipated to grow unless effective prevention programs are put into place.</p><p>In a systematic review of elder abuse from 2015, prevalence for abuse in North and South America was reported to range from 10 percent in cognitively intact older adults to 47 percent in adults with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Estimates for other regions ranged from 2 to 60 percent. A systematic review from 2008 found that 6 percent of older people surveyed in a wide range of countries (including European countries, Korea, the United States, and Canada) reported abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Psychological abuse was reported by nearly one-fourth of older people who were dependent on carers. In 2005, 41 percent of community-residing Medicare beneficiaries over 65 years of age had difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs (IADLs) and potentially needed support from paid or unpaid caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Many elders do not obtain the needed medical and social support due to lack of resources and refusal of care. The elder individual may lack awareness of their disability. This situation allows for the condition of self-neglect that is a phenomenon frequently encountered by adult protective services agencies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Domestic mistreatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data regarding domestic elder mistreatment are somewhat limited due to differences in definitions and data collection across the different jurisdictions in the United States. In general, studies have confirmed the expectation that cases of abuse are underreported to Adult Protective Services (APS) and that self-neglect is the most common condition among reported cases. Some estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse in the community range from 2 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Reports of several studies are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 1998 National Elder Abuse Incidence Study (NEAIS) evaluated the 1996 incidence of domestic elder abuse and neglect, including self-neglect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The study collected data from APS agencies and trained government employees with frequent elderly contact in 20 representative US counties. It was estimated that nationally 551,000 adults were subjected to abuse, neglect, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> self-neglect in the domestic setting in 1996; only 21 percent of cases were reported to and verified by APS. Self-neglect accounted for approximately 38 percent of the reported cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA) surveyed all US APS agencies in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among slightly more than 250,000 reports involving adults over 60 years of age and older, self-neglect was the most common type (39 percent), followed by caregiver neglect (21.5 percent) and financial exploitation (14 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project, a nationally representative study in the United States, asked community-living older adults (aged 57 to 85) about experiences of mistreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among 3000 survey respondents, 9 percent reported verbal mistreatment, 3.5 percent reported financial mistreatment, and only 0.2 percent reported physical mistreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall rate of elder mistreatment (physical abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect) was 3.2 percent in a sample of elders in Boston, Massachusetts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A similar sample in Canada reported a prevalence of 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2002 review by the WHO found combined rates of 4 to 6 percent for elder physical abuse, psychological abuse, financial abuse, and neglect in studies from Canada, Finland, the United States, and Great Britain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Data from developing countries was limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 220 family carers of British older patients newly referred for dementia, 34 percent reported abusive behavior &quot;at least sometimes&quot; (most commonly verbal) and only 1.4 percent acknowledged occasional physical abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another study of 129 persons with dementia and their caregivers detected mistreatment in nearly half (47.3 percent of sample, with abuse categorized as psychological only for 60 percent, neglect 20 percent, and some physical component 20 percent); participants had been informed prior to study consent that suspected elder mistreatment would generate mandated reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Institutional mistreatment (United States)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>US data from 2002 indicate that about 1.6 million people live in 17,000 licensed nursing homes and another 900,000 live in 45,000 residential care facilities (eg, assisted living facilities and personal care homes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Rates of usage of nursing homes by older adults in Canada, Israel, South Africa, and the United States range from 4 to 7 percent and in Latin America from 1 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Nationwide collection of data on complaints of institutional elder mistreatment is limited. State long-term care ombudsman programs (LTCOP) are federally mandated to report data via the National Ombudsman Reporting System (NORS), but underreporting is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The state LTCOP may not receive reports of institutional elder mistreatment that are directed to the agency that licenses and regulates the facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Additionally, underreporting by the facilities is suspected. Supporting this suspicion is the fact that most complaints to the state ombudsman programs are filed by facility residents, family, or friends rather than by facility personnel.</p><p>From 1999 to 2001, over 5000 nursing homes in the United States (one-third of all nursing homes) were cited for abuse violations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In 2008, approximately 269,000 complaints about elder mistreatment in institutions were registered with NORS, of which about 78 percent were related to nursing home care and the rest related to assisted living, board and care, and personal care facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Autopsy data are often not available to determine the cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Representative studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older, with nine years of follow-up, found that referral to Adult Protective Services (APS) for abuse, neglect, self-neglect, and financial exploitation was associated with shorter survival after adjusting for other factors associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The risk of death was increased threefold (odds ratio [OR] 3.1), compared with other members of the cohort, for those who experienced elder mistreatment and somewhat less (OR 1.7) for those identified with self-neglect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another cohort study of older adults followed for a median of seven years, reported self-neglect increased the risk of mortality almost sixfold in the first year, and risk remained increased but at a lower rate after one year (hazard ratio [HR] 5.82 and 1.39 respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Health consequences include multiple hospitalizations, medical non-adherence, living in squalor, pressure ulcers, untreated psychiatric and medical illness, and falls. An incident of financial exploitation may cause the elderly victim to lose independence and lose needed support, and these losses may result in morbidity and perhaps death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elder mistreatment is often undisclosed.

A conceptual model, based upon legal statutes in the United States and expert consensus opinion, identifies six key domains to be evaluated for determination of need for guardianship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a medical condition that may produce functional disability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment (short-term memory, communication, attention, executive function, and others)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty involving everyday functioning (ability to provide nutrition, shelter, and safety)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of the individual's values and preferences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of harm and level of supervision needed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of whether less restrictive alternatives to guardianship are feasible</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Decisional and executive capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultimately, the court must determine whether the elder has sufficient capacity to self-care and self-protect to avoid danger, and whether alternative measures to the appointment of a guardian are available. The presence of such problems as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, delusions, lack of insight, and refusal to accept help are important in the determination of need for guardianship.</p><p>The capacity for self-care and self-protection depends on whether an individual can both make and implement decisions regarding personal needs, health, and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This requires both intact decisional and executive capacity in relation to multiple functional domains: personal needs and hygiene, condition of home environment, activities for independent living, medical self-care, and managing financial affairs. Assessment of decision-making capacity is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-decision-making-capacity-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of decision-making capacity in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Components of decisional capacity are the ability to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communicate a choice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understand the relevant information</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appreciate the situation and its consequences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reason about treatment options</p><p/><p>Executive capacity requires executive function. Executive function refers to the ability to develop a plan, adapt to circumstances, and implement the plan.</p><p>Decisional capacity and executive capacity can be evaluated during the history and physical examination, with further input from geriatric assessment tools, information from APS agencies, family, police agencies, or evaluation of the home environment by members of a geriatric assessment team. Neuropsychological testing may be useful in cases where the capacity of the elder for self-care and self-protection remains in question.</p><p>The capacities to consent to sexual activity, to make a will, to vote, to drive, to transfer property, to consent to participation in research, and to consent to treatment are capacities of importance to elders that a clinician may be asked to specifically assess. Some of these more specific capacities, especially the capacities to transfer property, consent to sexual activity, and consent to treatment, may be needed to possess the more global capacity for self-care and self-protection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical, social, and legal interventions may be offered when an elder is determined to be the victim of elder mistreatment. Elders who are deemed to have the capacity to understand and consent to protective services may reject offered interventions from an Adult Protective Services (APS) agency. If the agency determines that the victim lacks the capacity to understand and consent to protective services and that a situation is unsafe, the agency may petition the courts for an emergency order for protective services. All but 13 of the US states and territories have statutes providing for these emergency or involuntary protective services for those without capacity to consent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The court may require a statement from a clinician to support a finding of the lack of capacity to consent to protective services before such an emergency order is issued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first obligation of the health care worker, in conjunction with social workers and community agencies, is to assure the safety of the at-risk elder. A home visit may sometimes be needed to make that determination.</p><p>If the situation at the home or nursing facility is deemed safe, elders who suffer from mistreatment may still need intervention for unmet medical needs. These may include treatment for depression, reversible dementia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or infection. Medical evaluation and treatment can be compelled, if the victim is deemed unable to consent.</p><p>Medical treatment and follow-up can be difficult. For example, the court may allow compelled evaluation in a medical clinic and removal of an incapacitated or incompetent person from her unsafe home, but if there is hostility to the agency and the medical providers chosen by them, resistance to and sabotage of the medical interventions may occur. Transfer of care to medical providers that are accepted by the patient and family may be needed. Follow-up by the APS agency may be necessary to ensure that the patient is being taken to the provider and that the treatment plan is being followed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Social interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mistreated elder may suffer from multiple challenges to safe and comfortable living, including inadequate housing, inadequate food, shut-off utilities, financial or physical inability to obtain medications, and inability to negotiate the health care system and arrange for medical visits or follow a treatment plan. The APS agencies may be able to provide resources themselves or activate resources from other agencies or the private sector. Law enforcement and the courts may need to be recruited by the APS to remove elders from abusive caregivers and place them in more supportive environments or obtain guardianship.</p><p>The APS agencies and the courts are obliged to use the least restrictive alternative when an individual's autonomy is impacted in order to protect that person. The government must explore all options and choose those that accomplish the needed protection while being no more restrictive than necessary. For example, if durable powers of attorney are in place and the designated power of attorney can effect needed decisions, guardianship should not be pursued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Reporting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a health care worker has reason to believe that an elder is in a state of abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or financial exploitation, appropriate reporting should be promptly initiated. Reporting of elder mistreatment is the most common intervention in the management of elder mistreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Statutes that address reporting of elder mistreatment to designated governmental agencies have been written in all states (and the District of Columbia) in the United States. APS and long-term care ombudsman programs (LTCOP) exist in all US jurisdictions. If there is doubt about where and how to report, one of these agencies can provide the needed information.</p><p>In all but Colorado, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, reporting is mandatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Texas, Wyoming, and other jurisdictions require reporting by anyone who suspects elder mistreatment, while most jurisdictions only require reporting by members of certain named occupations, including by health care workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Penalties for failure to report suspected abuse exist in 38 states and the District of Columbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Mandatory reporting requires a clinician to report suspected abuse even if a competent elder patient specifically asks that the abuse not be reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The statutes in all but Puerto Rico and South Dakota specifically provide for immunity from any civil or criminal liability for reporting and testifying about suspected elder abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation, so long as the communications are made in good faith [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>If reporting is motivated by the reporter's reasonable suspicion, governmental resources will assist with investigation, assessment, and case confirmation.

Outcomes were variable for multiple interventions that involved courses for professionals to heighten awareness of elder abuse or legal, psychological, and educational support programs for older individuals and their caregivers. A subsequent systematic review in 2016 also reported inadequate evidence to assess the effects of interventions to reduce the occurrence or recurrence of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>Prevention of abuse may be promoted by programs that provide respite for caregivers, support for informal (nonprofessional) caregivers, and encourage positive attitudes towards older people within a culture. The authors of this topic propose several approaches to target different groups and employ a variety of strategies that can play a role in the prevention of elder abuse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition that clinicians from any discipline who have contact with older adults, not just geriatricians or those working in elder care institutions, are in a position to make an important impact.

There should be a focus on risk factors, warning signs, the agencies to report suspicions to, and, as with clinicians, education designed to remove some of the barriers to reporting caused by ignorance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Awareness that most long-term care facility abuse occurs from resident to resident. Background checks for a history of criminal activity, sexual assault, or other violent behaviors may be reasonable for potential residents who are more mobile. Psychiatric patients are overrepresented in long-term care facilities and may be aggressive, younger, and more mobile than other older adults in the facility and thus able to inflict more damage. In addition to screening, there needs to be adequate monitoring of the residents for abusive behaviors. Redirection, separation of the perpetrator from the victim, the use of alarms, and perhaps expulsion of the offender may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education and administrative interventions to address conditions in institutions that may promote resident elder mistreatment by staff members.
