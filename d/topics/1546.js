However, the full clinical potential of rMPI has not been realized due to numerous factors producing artifacts. These artifacts degrade image quality and increase the risk of misinterpretation of the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Soft tissue attenuation is one of the more common causes of rMPI artifact. The heart is surrounded by tissues of varying densities (eg, bone, lungs, and breast). Radionuclide imaging of the thorax results in nonuniform myocardial photon activity due to these intervening structures. Unpredictable artifact may arise when the body habitus differs significantly from expected gender-specific patterns. Photon attenuation and the resultant artifacts are affected by several factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depth of the heart in the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient position under the camera.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiopharmaceutical tracer (eg, thallium versus technetium) and dose of the tracer</p><p/><p>Soft tissue attenuation may result in an apparent fixed or reversible perfusion abnormality. Because it is caused by fixed anatomic structures, attenuation artifact is usually present both on stress and rest imaging. It is therefore interpreted as a fixed perfusion abnormality, resulting in incorrect diagnosis of myocardial <span class=\"nowrap\">scar/infarction</span>. However, if the position of the patient, and thus the tissue causing attenuation, is different during stress and rest imaging, soft tissue attenuation may produce a reversible perfusion defect mimicking ischemia.</p><p>In either case, attenuation artifact causes an increase in false-positive studies, resulting in decreased specificity for the diagnosis of CHD and a decrease in the confidence of the referring and interpreting clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. False-positive scans may lead to unwarranted further testing, including cardiac catheterization, resulting in increased costs and the potential for patient morbidity. Paradoxically, a high frequency of attenuation artifact may cause the interpreting clinician to disregard true perfusion abnormalities, assuming artifact instead, thereby reducing sensitivity of the test. Consequently, patients with CHD may be missed or go undertreated. </p><p>Sources of attenuation with SPECT rMPI and ways to interpret or eliminate attenuation artifacts will be discussed here. The clinical uses of SPECT rMPI are discussed in detail separately.

This artifact results in a perfusion defect in the inferior segments which generally correspond to the right coronary artery (RCA) territory. Diaphragmatic attenuation is estimated to occur in up to 25 percent of myocardial perfusion studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Diaphragmatic attenuation is more common in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men compared to women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal protuberance (eg, ascites, or peritoneal dialysis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated left hemidiaphragm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of thallium as the radiopharmaceutical tracer (compared with technetium)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast attenuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast attenuation decreases counts detected in the anterior, anteroseptal, or lateral walls depending upon the position of the breast. This results in perfusion artifacts anterior or anterolateral segments, corresponding to in the left anterior descending <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left circumflex artery territories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Soft tissue attenuation from breasts may produce artifacts in up to 40 percent of myocardial perfusion studies in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Breast size, breast tissue density, and breast position relative to the heart may affect the extent and severity of soft tissue attenuation. Large, pendulous breasts that tend to lie closer to the lateral chest wall are more likely to attenuate the lateral myocardial wall, whereas small breasts that lie over the anterior chest wall may attenuate the anterior or anteroseptal walls of the myocardium. A combination of these characteristics may result in both anterolateral and anteroseptal attenuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Attenuation artifacts of the anterior and anterolateral myocardial walls may also occur in men with gynecomastia or significant obesity. Women with breast implants require special consideration as artifacts may intensify.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver attenuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft tissue attenuation due to increased radionuclide tracer in the liver (ie, a &quot;hot&quot; liver) may distort counts detected in the inferior wall, resulting in artifactual perfusion abnormalities in the left circumflex or right coronary artery territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Because exercise enhances the clearance of tracer from the liver, these artifacts may be less common with exercise stress than with vasodilator or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress. To provide tracer clearance from the liver, it is advisable to wait longer (at least 45 minutes) prior to imaging patients after pharmacologic stress testing compared to waiting 15 minutes following exercise. Combining exercise with vasodilator stress reduces liver activity in comparison to vasodilator stress alone and patients may be imaged earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Attenuation due to obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft tissue attenuation and scatter of photons due to obesity may reduce the diagnostic accuracy of rMPI. This was illustrated in a study of 607 patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> SPECT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Obesity (body mass index of &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2)</span> was associated with a significantly lower accuracy for diagnosing coronary heart disease (86 versus 92 percent for nonobese patients).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS TO IMPROVE ARTIFACT RECOGNITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While it is difficult to entirely eliminate the attenuation of photon counts due to soft tissue, with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), soft tissue attenuation can often be recognized and distinguished from true myocardial perfusion defects, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Several methods have been developed to improve artifact recognition, with varying degrees of success. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of planar images</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative analysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast markers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged acquisition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher energy radiopharmaceuticals (technetium-99m versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prone imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG-gated SPECT imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attenuation correction</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Planar images</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Review of a cine loop of planar rotating images may identify potential problems due to soft tissue attenuation, motion, abnormal lung activity, and other incidental findings (eg, neoplastic lesions). The planar images provide valuable information about the proximity of soft tissue to the myocardial structures to alert the readers of potential areas of soft tissue attenuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitative analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of quantitative perfusion SPECT scans may assist in differentiating attenuation artifacts from true perfusion defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Normal databases have quantified gender-dependent myocardial perfusion distributions in normal populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Based upon the degree of variation of the study from expected patterns, abnormality criteria have been developed that may serve as a second opinion in differentiating between coronary disease and attenuation artifact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast markers (eg, intravenous tubing filled with radioactive materials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a>, or technetium-99m) outlining the breast have been used in the past to delineate the relationship between breast tissue and myocardial structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/6,8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,16</a>]. Breast markers were primarily used with planar imaging. In the era of SPECT imaging, this procedure is rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolonged data acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When significant soft tissue attenuation is anticipated or encountered, a prolonged duration of data acquisition, which allows for greater isotope detection by the camera, may reduce the potential for attenuation artifacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of technetium-based imaging agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium-99m has advantages over thallium as a radionuclide tracer for myocardial imaging. Technetium-99m has higher emission energy (140keV versus 78 keV) and a shorter half-life (six hours versus 72 hours) that permit administration of a higher dose. These qualities result in improved image quality and contrast, and less soft tissue attenuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The potential utility of technetium-99m was initially illustrated in a study of 13 patients with a false-positive thallium studies as shown by normal coronary angiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Repeat imaging with technetium showed an inferior perfusion defect in only one patient.</p><p>Despite this advantage, attenuation artifact continues to be a significant problem with the use of technetium-based agents. A recognized downside to technetium 99m-based imaging is the increased frequency of liver and gut activity in contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prone imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prone imaging can reduce diaphragmatic attenuation and improve inferior wall image quality. The rationale for prone imaging is that the heart shifts slightly superior and the diaphragm is more inferior in the prone position, increasing the distance between the diaphragm and the inferior wall of the left ventricle. Thus, in a study in which an inferior perfusion abnormality is observed on supine imaging but not on prone imaging, the abnormality should be considered to be due to attenuation, and the study can be considered normal. </p><p>It is recommended that standard supine imaging be performed first, followed by prone imaging if there is concern regarding inferior wall attenuation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diaphragmatic attenuation'</a> above.)</p><p>Most experts recommend selective prone imaging in patients with inferior perfusion abnormalities on supine imaging, but some favor imaging all patients in both supine and prone positions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Combined imaging (prone, supine) requires additional camera and technologist time reducing laboratory efficiency. In addition, as mentioned previously, prone imaging may occasionally create fixed anterior or lateral defects, which may represent attenuation artifact. Just as supine position may produce a lateral hot spot, prone imaging may result in a septal hot spot, as the septum lies closer to the detector in the prone position.</p><p>The prognostic value of prone imaging was assessed in a series of 3834 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. All patients underwent stress testing with rest thallium 201 and stress technetium 99m-sestamibi rMPI in the supine position; those patients with an inferior defect also had prone imaging. At a mean follow-up of 24 months, patients with inferior wall abnormalities on supine imaging that were absent on prone imaging had a low risk of subsequent cardiac events that was comparable to the risk in patients with normal supine-only studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG-gated SPECT imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECG-gating refers to the process of acquiring images on successive beats at multiple points in the cardiac cycle. Based upon timing related to the QRS complex, a moving image of a sample ventricular contraction is reconstructed. Using this technique, both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular function can be assessed.</p><p>ECG-gated imaging, also called functional imaging, may help differentiate between myocardial infarction and attenuation artifact. Normal regional function (ie, normal wall motion and myocardial thickening) in an area with a fixed defect on perfusion imaging can be classified as a soft tissue attenuation artifact, whereas abnormal function in conjunction with a similar fixed defect would be compatible with myocardial infarction or myocardial stunning. In contrast, this gating technique is not useful in determining whether a reversible perfusion abnormality is due to CHD since the gating procedure is acquired 45 to 60 minutes later at such a time that a wall motion abnormality due to ischemia has most often resolved and will not be observed. Similarly, this technique is not useful in &quot;stress-only&quot; or acute rest MPI studies.</p><p>The potential value of ECG-gated imaging has been illustrated in multiple studies, including one study of 180 consecutive patients with fixed myocardial perfusion defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among the 102 with ECG or historical evidence of a prior myocardial infarction, 96 percent had abnormal function on ECG-gated imaging, whereas only 23 percent of patients with a fixed defect but no prior infarction had abnormal defect function. In patients with normal function on gated images, 91 percent of the fixed defects could be accounted for by soft tissue attenuation.</p><p>ECG-gated functional imaging also improves reader confidence. This was illustrated in a series of 285 consecutive patients, in which the number of borderline readings was significantly reduced by the addition of gated images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Among those with a low likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD), the addition of gating significantly increased the &quot;normal&quot; interpretation from 74 to 93 percent. In patients with known CHD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> previous myocardial infarction, the addition of gated images increased the &quot;abnormal&quot; interpretations from 78 to 92 percent, although this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>ECG-gated LV functional data also add prognostic information. As an example, in a study of 3207 patients who underwent rMPI with ECG-gating, patients with an abnormal ECG-gated myocardial wall motion score had an annual event rate (nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death) of 6.1 percent compared with 1.6 percent for patients with a normal score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. An abnormal ECG-gating score was associated with an adverse prognosis regardless of the perfusion data. Conversely, those with normal perfusion and wall motion had an excellent prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72140\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72140 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In contrast to its utility in distinguishing prior infarction from artifact, gated imaging cannot differentiate ischemia (suggested by a reversible perfusion defect) from artifact because the wall motion in the region with the defect is often normal in both circumstances. In addition, ECG-gated functional imaging cannot be used to differentiate attenuation artifact in circumstances in which only one image is available (eg, emergency department imaging for acute chest pain, stress-only imaging).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ATTENUATION CORRECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attenuation correction refers to automated methods that adjust the intensity of the myocardial perfusion image to reflect the estimated magnitude of soft tissue attenuation on different regions of the heart. Attenuation correction methods include either line-source or computed tomographic (CT) techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artifacts due to soft tissue attenuation may be improved by various techniques of attenuation correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In order to apply such methods, it is necessary to create a patient-specific attenuation map [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. An attenuation map represents the degree of photon attenuation across different areas of the thorax.</p><p>Transmission imaging is one means of creating an attenuation map. With this method, an external source of radiation (eg, technetium, gadolinium, or x-ray) is positioned on one side of the patient and a detector on the other side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The distance between the source and detector is known, and from the measured intensity data one can calculate the degree of attenuation across the thorax. By obtaining a number of these measures at different angles, a &quot;map&quot; of attenuation across the thorax is generated. The attenuation maps are then integrated with the raw myocardial perfusion images to reconstruct image data with attenuation correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Different camera systems have been designed with various geometric arrangements of transmission sources, including <span class=\"nowrap\">point/line/sheet</span> sources or a scanning line source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/25,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-32</a>]. The most common configuration for transmission imaging uses a gadolinium-153 scanning line source with dual-head 90-degree detectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As the scanning line source system moves and generates transmission images opposite the external source, images are simultaneously acquired through an electronic window in the detector that moves in a direction opposite to the line source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Such an arrangement makes cross-contamination less likely. However, the scanning line source system is geometrically complex and less sensitive. It requires strict quality control and system maintenance to ensure precise movement of the line source and electronic window as well as source strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging is increasingly being used to create an attenuation map. Several camera systems now offer this option with emerging validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attenuation correction improves the relative uniformity of radionuclide tracer distribution in patients with a low likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD), resulting in an improvement in diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. In general, attenuation correction results in fewer false-positive tests, which is demonstrated by improved specificity and higher rates of normal studies in control populations.</p><p>The diagnostic value of attenuation correction is demonstrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 60 patients with known CHD and 59 controls, the addition of attenuation correction increased the percent of studies in controls that were read as normal (88 to 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, sensitivity was not improved with attenuation correction, and for patients with RCA or multivessel disease, it was slightly worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attenuation artifact is more prevalent in obese patients.

The specificity for clinically significant CHD (stenosis &ge;70 percent) was significantly improved with attenuation correction, regardless of BMI (79 versus 50 percent in nonobese patients, and 76 versus 41 percent in obese patients).</p><p/><p>In 2002, the American Society of Nuclear Medicine and the Society of Nuclear Medicine published a position statement outlining the quality control methods for attenuation correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A number of the above studies were performed prior to the implementation of this publication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. With improved quality control and newer generations of hardware and software, the performance of attenuation correction algorithms may improve further.</p><p>The combination of attenuation correction with other corrective adjustments, including ECG gating, results in additive improvements in diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Attenuation-corrected quantitative analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial perfusion studies are usually interpreted by visual inspection.

In addition, gender-differences in attenuation artifact contribute to the differences in normal values used in quantitative analyses for men and women.

Quantitative analysis was first performed without attenuation correction using normal values from a gender-specific database (derived from uncorrected rMPI studies), and then repeated with attenuation correction and the new gender-independent normal database (also derived from attenuation corrected studies). Using the corrected images and the gender-independent database, there was a significant increase in the number of studies interpreted as normal (90 versus 52 percent in the uncorrected analysis), and in specificity (57 versus 29 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generally, attenuation correction solutions for both line source and CT require large field of view camera systems.

Only the stress images were made available for interpretation by 10 experienced readers. Images were read for diagnostic accuracy in the following sequence: rMPI alone, rMPI with ECG-gated SPECT images, and attenuation-corrected rMPI with gated images. Forty-one patients underwent catheterization within sixty days of imaging. Attenuation-corrected data significantly reduced the perceived need for rest imaging (43 versus 77 percent with rMPI alone) and allowed the readers to characterize significantly more studies as definitely normal or abnormal (84 versus 37 percent with rMPI alone).</p><p>The prognostic value of stress-only imaging with attenuation correction was demonstrated in 652 patients (428 women) with low to intermediate probability of coronary heart disease (CHD) who were being evaluated for chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Similar risk stratification was identified with summed stress scores (SSS) in the 4 to 8 (mild) and 9&gt; (moderate to severe) range as well as completely normal (0). However, in patients with SSS after attenuation correction of 1 to 3, outcomes were similar to those with mild perfusion abnormalities. These data suggest that after attenuation corrected studies, any resulting perfusion abnormality should be considered abnormal and consistent with CAD. </p><p>An information statement by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) strongly recommended the use of stress-only imaging in patients without known coronary artery disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> no history of prior myocardial infarction or bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Furthermore, a position statement by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology in 2009 also emphasized the value of stress-only imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attenuation-artifact-in-spect-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Data from stress-only imaging risk stratification have greatly enhanced previous study.

These data suggest that the incidence of coronary disease in these patients is very low. However, the stress-only study should be completely normal, and this procedure is best performed with attenuation correction, resulting in fewer rest studies being performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18686597\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the heart is surrounded by tissues of varying densities (eg, bone, lungs, and breast), soft tissue attenuation is one of the most common causes of artifact seen on radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are multiple sources of attenuation artifact, with the most common clinically relevant sources being diaphragmatic attenuation, breast attenuation, liver attenuation, and attenuation due to obesity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Sources of attenuation artifact'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While it is difficult to entirely eliminate the attenuation of photon counts due to soft tissue, with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), soft tissue attenuation can often be recognized and distinguished from true myocardial perfusion defects. Methods employed with SPECT to reduced attenuation include the review of planar images, the ability for quantitative analysis, prolonged acquisition times, prone imaging, and ECG-gating. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Methods to improve artifact recognition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of prone imaging, in which the heart shifts slightly superior and the diaphragm is more inferior, thereby increasing the distance between the diaphragm and the inferior wall, can reduce diaphragmatic attenuation and improve inferior wall image quality. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prone imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG-gating refers to the process of acquiring images on successive beats at multiple points in the cardiac cycle. ECG-gated imaging, also called functional imaging, may help differentiate between myocardial infarction and attenuation artifact. Normal wall motion and myocardial thickening in an area with a fixed defect on perfusion imaging is consistent with soft tissue attenuation artifact, whereas abnormal function in conjunction with a similar fixed defect would be compatible with myocardial infarction or myocardial stunning. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'ECG-gated SPECT imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attenuation correction refers to automated methods that adjust the intensity of the myocardial perfusion image to reflect the estimated magnitude of soft tissue attenuation on different regions of the heart. Attenuation correction improves the relative uniformity of radionuclide tracer distribution in patients with a low likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD), resulting in an improvement in diagnostic accuracy.
