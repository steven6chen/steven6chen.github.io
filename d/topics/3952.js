EBV is the primary agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM), persists asymptomatically for life in nearly all adults, and is associated with the development of B cell lymphomas, T cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinomas in certain patients. Reactivation disease is not a prominent issue with EBV, in contrast to other common herpesviruses, but it has been associated with an aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and treatment of EBV infections will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of EBV as pertains to infectious mononucleosis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2004940\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of primary EBV infections throughout the world are subclinical and inapparent. Antibodies to EBV have been demonstrated in all population groups with a worldwide distribution; approximately 90 to 95 percent of adults are EBV-seropositive. The host range of EBV is restricted to humans and certain subhuman primates including squirrel monkeys and cotton top marmosets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2004947\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like other members of the herpesvirus family, EBV has a latency phase. The host cells for the organism in humans are limited to B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells and myocytes. Unlike herpes simplex (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV is capable of transforming B cells but does not routinely display a cytopathic effect. A detailed discussion of the virology of EBV is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV can cause a number of primary infections, can lead to complications, and can induce a variety of malignancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2005083\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute infectious mononucleosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is the best known acute clinical manifestation of EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. IM often begins with malaise, headache, and low-grade fever before development of the more specific signs of tonsillitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharyngitis, cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness, and moderate to high fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Affected patients usually have peripheral blood lymphocytosis, composed in large measure of atypical lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55986\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55986 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The lymphadenopathy characteristically is symmetric and involves the posterior cervical chain more than the anterior chain. Tonsillar exudate is a frequent component of the pharyngitis; the exudate can have a white, gray-green, or necrotic appearance.</p><p>Severe fatigue may be prominent, while other less common findings include palatal petechiae, periorbital or palpebral edema, and maculopapular or morbilliform rashes. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are frequent in patients with IM, probably reflecting the mild hepatitis encountered in about 90 percent of infected individuals. Splenomegaly occurs in as many as 50 percent of patients, but jaundice and hepatomegaly are uncommon.</p><p>Most patients with IM caused by EBV have prominent pharyngeal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are, however, several other forms of the illness. Some individuals with IM present with the so-called &quot;glandular&quot; form of the disease in which lymph node enlargement is out of proportion to the pharyngeal symptoms; others develop a systemic form of the infection in which fever and fatigue predominate, while lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis are mild or absent. Some patients have hepatitis in the absence of other typical features of IM.</p><p>Most individuals with primary EBV infection recover uneventfully and develop a high degree of durable immunity. Acute symptoms resolve in one to two weeks, but fatigue often persists for months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2005184\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary EBV infection in infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary EBV infections in young infants and children are common and frequently asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, a variety of manifestations have been observed, including otitis media, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, upper respiratory infection, and IM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, one series reported 32 children younger than 4 years of age with IM, selected from a population of 200 children by review of blood smears (more than 50 percent mononuclear cells and more than 10 percent atypical lymphocytes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of these children had clinical evidence compatible with IM (significant cervical adenopathy and tonsillar pharyngitis); respiratory symptoms were frequently prominent, especially in young infants.</p><p>Children can have symptomatic primary EBV infection without the production of heterophile antibodies; as a result, EBV-specific serologic studies are required to establish the diagnosis. In the above series of 32 children, interpretation of the results of serology was most problematic in children below the age of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heterophile test was particularly insensitive (25 percent positive for ages 10 to 24 months versus 75 percent for ages 24 to 28 months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM was less frequently positive in infants (60 percent compared with 100 percent in older children and young adults); in addition, peak titers of VCA antibody were lower, and the development of antibodies to early antigen was less common in infants.</p><p/><p>Despite the reduction in antibody production, young infants can mount an EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response during acute EBV infection and that the latent proteins recognized are identical to those recognized by young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital and perinatal infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine infection with EBV is rare because fewer than 5 percent of pregnant women are susceptible to the virus. In addition, prospective studies of susceptible (ie, seronegative) women have not found evidence of congenital abnormalities among infants of women who did develop primary EBV infection during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While isolated cases of infants with some evidence for EBV infection and congenital anomalies (biliary atresia, congenital heart disease, hypotonia, micrognathia, cataracts and thrombocytopenia) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the evidence argues against EBV as a significant cause of congenital infection. Specifically, no evidence of EBV infection has been demonstrated in large studies of children with congenital anomalies or in cord blood samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV can affect virtually any organ system and has been associated with such diverse disease manifestations as pneumonia, myocarditis, pancreatitis, mesenteric adenitis, myositis, glomerulonephritis, and genital ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A large number of other manifestations have been associated with primary EBV infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic syndromes can include Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, facial nerve palsy, meningoencephalitis, aseptic meningitis, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuritis, and optic neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematologic abnormalities can include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic <span class=\"nowrap\">purpura/hemolytic-uremic</span> syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13966774\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic EBV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic EBV infection is a rare disorder characterized by ongoing symptoms of an infectious mononucleosis syndrome with active viremia.

The incidence initially was reported to be as high as 70 to 90 percent but is probably lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The mechanism responsible for this rash is not understood but has been thought to involve circulating antibodies to ampicillin. Development of this rash during IM does not appear to presage an ampicillin allergy; patients have subsequently tolerated ampicillin without an adverse reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral hairy leukoplakia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another EBV-mediated mucocutaneous manifestation is oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL), which is an unusual disease of the lingual squamous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. OHL generally affects the lateral portions of the tongue, although the floor of the mouth, the palate, or the buccal mucosa may also be involved. The lesions are described as white corrugated painless plaques that, unlike candida, cannot be scraped from the surface to which they adhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72106\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72106 \">picture 2</a>). They are not generally associated with fever.</p><p>The OHL lesions appear to be relatively specific for HIV infection, since they are only rarely observed in patients with other immunodeficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy appears to have reduced the incidence of OHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>OHL is associated with intense EBV replication and the action of EBV-encoded proteins such as latent membrane protein-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, studies in which EBV replication has been suppressed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> have demonstrated persistent, nonproductive EBV infection and continued EBV entry from the blood into the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

EBV is the primary agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and is associated with the development of B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of primary EBV infections throughout the world are subclinical and inapparent. (See <a href=\"#H2004940\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious mononucleosis (IM) usually begins with malaise, headache, and low-grade fever before onset of more specific signs of the infection, such as pharyngitis and cervical lymph node enlargement. Patients usually have a peripheral blood lymphocytosis, with a significant proportion of atypical lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"#H2005083\" class=\"local\">'Acute infectious mononucleosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary EBV infections in young infants and children are common but are frequently asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, a variety of manifestations have been observed, including otitis media, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, upper respiratory infection, and symptoms and signs consistent with infectious mononucleosis. (See <a href=\"#H2005184\" class=\"local\">'Primary EBV infection in infants and children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine infection with EBV is rare because fewer than 5 percent of pregnant women are susceptible to the virus. In addition, congenital abnormalities have not been documented among infants of women who did develop primary EBV infection during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Congenital and perinatal infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morbilliform rashes sometimes follow the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> in a patient with infectious mononucleosis. The mechanism responsible for this rash is not understood but has been thought to involve circulating antibodies to ampicillin. Development of this rash during IM does not appear to presage an ampicillin allergy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is described as white corrugated painless plaques that usually affect the lateral portions of the tongue among patients with advanced HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Oral hairy leukoplakia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic rupture is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of IM and may be the first symptom of infectious mononucleosis that brings the patient to medical attention. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Splenic rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mainstay of treatment for patients with infectious mononucleosis and other manifestations of primary EBV disease is supportive care. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are recommended for the treatment of fever, throat discomfort, and malaise.
