Support for this approach includes randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-major-depression-choosing-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Support for this approach includes randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-major-depression-choosing-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Choosing antimanic pharmacotherapy and the efficacy of antimanic drugs are described elsewhere.

Patients receive initial pharmacotherapy and progress through each step until they respond. The duration of an adequate treatment trial is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-and-pharmacotherapy-general-principles#H428761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles&quot;, section on 'Duration of an adequate trial'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, psychotherapy is nearly always indicated as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment#H5072309\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment&quot;, section on 'Adjunctive psychotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Following response to acute treatment, patients receive maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences. (See <a href=\"#H11278054\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment#H10835695\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment&quot;, section on 'Maintenance treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11277684\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First line treatment for children and adolescents with moderate to severe bipolar major depression is a second-generation antipsychotic plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Typically the two drugs are started simultaneously. However, for patients who are moderately ill, a reasonable alternative is to initially start only an antipsychotic; patients who respond within one to two weeks continue with antipsychotic monotherapy, whereas patients who do not respond satisfactorily receive add-on treatment with an SSRI. The second-generation antipsychotics that we use include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lurasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lurasidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">quetiapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>. SSRIs typically used include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">escitalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sertraline</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Citalopram</a> is generally avoided, given the concerns about cardiac conduction problems at doses higher than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">paroxetine</a> is also not recommended given problems with withdrawal symptoms and drug interactions. </p><p>For pediatric bipolar major depression that does not respond to a second-generation antipsychotic plus an SSRI within six to eight weeks, we suggest that clinicians continue the antipsychotic and switch to another antidepressant. We generally switch to a different SSRI by cross-tapering the two drugs over a few days to one week. If patients do not respond to the antipsychotic plus a different SSRI within six to eight weeks, we usually continue the antipsychotic and switch to another antidepressant, such as a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">venlafaxine</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bupropion</a>. The antidepressants are cross-tapered over one to two weeks. However, a reasonable alternative is to continue the SSRI and switch antipsychotics by cross-tapering them over one to two weeks. Additional information about switching antidepressants is discussed separately in the context of adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=switching-antidepressant-medications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Switching antidepressant medications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of a second-generation antipsychotic plus an SSRI for pediatric bipolar major depression includes an eight-week randomized trial that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a> with placebo in 255 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-major-depression-choosing-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Remission occurred in more patients treated with <span class=\"nowrap\">olanzapine/fluoxetine</span> than placebo (59 versus 43 percent), and the median time to remission with active drug was approximately seven weeks. Importantly, switching to mania was comparable for active drug and placebo (1 and 0 percent). However, mean weight gain was greater with <span class=\"nowrap\">olanzapine/fluoxetine</span> than placebo (4.4 versus 0.5 kg), and the incidence of sedation, tremor, hyperlipidemia, or hyperprolactinemia was greater with <span class=\"nowrap\">olanzapine/fluoxetine</span>. Increases in heart rate and corrected QT interval were also greater with <span class=\"nowrap\">olanzapine/fluoxetine</span>.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a> for short-term treatment of bipolar major depression in youth is consistent with results from randomized trials in adults with bipolar major depression.

For these treatment resistant patients, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, or omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids). If patients partially responded to a second-generation antipsychotic plus an antidepressant, we add lamotrigine, lithium, or omega-3 fatty acids to the existing regimen. If there was little to no response to the antipsychotic plus antidepressant, we discontinue the antidepressant and add lamotrigine, lithium, or omega-3 fatty acids to the antipsychotic; however, a reasonable alternative is to discontinue both the antipsychotic and antidepressant, and to start lamotrigine or lithium monotherapy. Omega-3 fatty acids are rarely used as monotherapy.</p><p>Patients unresponsive to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> (as add-on treatment or monotherapy) are switched to the other drug by cross-tapering them over one to two weeks. Omega-3 fatty acids can be added at any point during treatment because they are well tolerated. </p><p>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a> are discussed separately.

The dose is typically 500 to 1000 mg twice per day. &#160;</p><p>Antidepressants should generally be tapered before discontinuation. A taper of approximately 25 to 50 percent per week provides a gradual decrease that allows the body time to adjust to the lower dose. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sertraline</a> 200 mg per day can be decreased to 150 mg per day for week 1, 100 mg per day for week 2, 50 mg per day for week 3, and 25 mg per day for week 4, after which the medication is stopped. However, the half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a> is long enough such that abrupt discontinuation generally does not cause problems. Additional information about discontinuing antidepressants is discussed separately.

If these patients are not currently treated with pharmacotherapy, they are started on an antimanic maintenance drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-bipolar-disorder-overview-of-choosing-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild episodes of pediatric bipolar major depression are generally characterized by five or six depressive symptoms, minor impairment of functioning, and the absence of suicidal ideation and behavior and psychotic features. For patients with mild episodes of bipolar major depression who are currently treated with an antimanic drug (eg, second-generation antipsychotic), we suggest treatment with adjunctive psychotherapy such as psychoeducation or family therapy, rather than additional pharmacotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients unresponsive to initial treatment receive additional pharmacotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H11277634\" class=\"local\">'Mild episodes'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For initial treatment of pediatric bipolar major depression that is moderate (eg, seven depressive symptoms, with no suicidal behavior or psychosis) to severe (eg, eight or nine depressive symptoms, with psychosis or suicidal behavior), we suggest a second-generation antipsychotic plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), rather than other medication regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If patients do not respond to an antipsychotic and SSRI combination, we typically continue the antipsychotic and switch antidepressants. However, a reasonable alternative is to continue the initial antidepressant and switch to a different second-generation antipsychotic. (See <a href=\"#H11277684\" class=\"local\">'Initial drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to severe pediatric bipolar major depression that does not respond to a second-generation antipsychotic plus an antidepressant is treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a>, or omega-3 fatty acids. If patients partially responded to a second-generation antipsychotic plus an antidepressant, we add lamotrigine, lithium, or omega-3 fatty acids to the existing regimen. If there was little to no response to the antipsychotic plus antidepressant, we discontinue the antidepressant and add lamotrigine, lithium, or omega-3 fatty acids to the antipsychotic; however, a reasonable alternative is to discontinue both the antipsychotic and antidepressant, and to start lamotrigine or lithium monotherapy. Omega-3 fatty acids are rarely used as monotherapy.
