These disorders are characterized by growth failure and normal or increased circulating levels of GH, in contrast with GH deficiency. In addition, many affected individuals also have low circulating levels of GH-binding protein (GHBP, which is equivalent to the shed extracellular-binding domain of the GH receptor) and is measured in a commercially available clinical test reflecting the number of GH receptors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The classic model of GHI is in patients with Laron syndrome, caused by mutations in the GH receptor gene. However, subsequent experience has shown that there is a spectrum of GHI caused by a variety of defects along the GH&ndash;insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80626 \">figure 1</a>). These disorders will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p>A growing body of literature suggests that some patients with idiopathic short stature often have a component of GH resistance, which may call for alternative treatment approaches such as adjusting GH doses based on IGF-I levels. These considerations are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-treatment-for-idiopathic-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone treatment for idiopathic short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12573712\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GHI can be caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GH receptor gene or in its downstream mediators, the most important of which is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). These syndromes are characterized by normal or elevated levels of GH and low levels of IGF-I (except for IGF-I receptor mutations, in which IGF-I levels are normal or high) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12574092\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth hormone receptor mutations (Laron syndrome)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laron syndrome (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/262500&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9O0RPkEx7zEHYX4tIWEHW17&amp;TOPIC_ID=15796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #262500</a>), the most common known cause of genetically-mediated GHI, is characterized by severe postnatal growth failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the growth hormone (GH) receptor gene; a variety of mutations have been identified, most of which affect the extracellular GH-binding region of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>Patients with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the GH receptor gene have severe growth failure, with a mean adult height in one report of 119 cm (47 inches) in females and 124 cm (49 inches) in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, there is wide variability in adult height, ranging in another series from -2.2 to -10.4 standard deviation score (SDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The variation in adult height appears to be caused by variable activation of the GH axis, as reflected by IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein&nbsp;3 (IGFBP-3) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Adult height does not correlate with genotype or with measures of height in family members.</p><p>Other clinical features of Laron syndrome include small head circumference, characteristic facies with saddle nose and prominent forehead, delayed skeletal maturation, small genitalia and testes, short limb length compared with trunk length, and abnormal body composition, with osteopenia and obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80534\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80534 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70163 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Intellectual development is normal or only modestly impaired. Unlike patients with IGF-I deficiency (described below), there is minimal disturbance of prenatal growth.</p><p>Patients with Laron syndrome also have metabolic abnormalities including hyperlipidemia and episodes of hypoglycemia, especially during infancy. Data are conflicting on the risk of insulin resistance. An Ecuadorian cohort displays less insulin resistance and lower rates of diabetes than relatives without Laron syndrome, despite higher percentage body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Possible explanations for the apparent difference in diabetes among these two populations with Laron syndrome include differences in environment (lifestyle, diet, etc), differences in IGF-I dosing, differences in the specific GH receptor mutation, or differences in genetic risk for diabetes in their underlying gene pool. Understanding the differences in energy intake and expenditure may give insight to more fundamental aspects of energy balance. </p><p>Moreover, individuals with Laron syndrome appear to have much lower cancer rates than in healthy controls. Experimental evidence from animal models and in vitro studies suggest that the low levels of IGF-I in Laron syndrome are responsible for the reduced susceptibility to cancer and for increased longevity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12574106\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-GH receptor mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to GH receptor gene mutations, GHI can occur through mutations in the post-GH receptor signaling pathway.

The general approach to this assessment is discussed in a separate topic review.

Patients with post-GH receptor defects have distinct clinical and biochemical patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>).

However, interpretation of these tests requires caution:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In young children (&lt;3 years old), relatively low levels of IGF-I are the norm, so this finding is not diagnostic of GHI in this age group. Other causes of low IGF-I levels include poor nutritional status, hypothyroidism, and renal failure, so these causes must be excluded to make the diagnosis of GHI. In normal children, IGF-I levels rise two- to fourfold during puberty, as a result of increased production during that time. IGF-I and GH reach maximal levels around the time of peak height velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels of IGFBP-3 may be more informative because it is less likely to vary with age, nutritional status, and chronic illness. IGFBP-3 is low in most of the GHI syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>). An exception is in patients with an IGF-I gene mutation, who have elevated IGFBP-3 levels, with low IGF-I levels. This possibility should be considered in patients with severe prenatal growth failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'IGF-I and IGFBP-3'</a> and <a href=\"#H12574578\" class=\"local\">'IGF-I gene mutations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711699142\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth hormone concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal or high basal GH level provides support for the diagnosis of GHI but is not diagnostic and should be interpreted with caution. Normal GH levels are also typical of patients with idiopathic short stature, so this finding is not suspicious for GHI unless the patient also has severe growth failure (height &lt;3 SD below the mean). If the GH result is used to support the diagnosis of GHI, we suggest repeating the test one or more times before concluding that the patient has a GHI syndrome.</p><p>Notably, most short patients with normal GH levels do <strong>not</strong> have one of these GHI syndromes and are classified as having idiopathic short stature rather than GHI. However, lesser degrees of GH resistance may play a role in idiopathic short stature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80626\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80626 \">figure 1</a>). Most of these patients with idiopathic short stature are not eligible for treatment with recombinant IGF-I based on treatment recommendations, which are described below. Such patients may respond to GH therapy, but they may require adjustment of the GH dose to achieve therapeutic IGF-I levels. These patients can be considered to have mild (partial) GHI, since levels of IGF-I may rise to some degree after GH administration, but require doses higher than are typically used for treatment of GH deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Testing for GHBP is commercially available. </p><p>In patients with clinical characteristics of severe GHI and normal or elevated circulating GH levels, a low level of GHBP strongly supports a diagnosis of Laron syndrome, but normal levels are uninformative. This is because patients with Laron syndrome have low GHBP levels only if the GH receptor mutation affects the extracellular binding domain, but GHBP levels are normal or high if the GH receptor mutation affects the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain of the GH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. GHBP levels also are normal in patients with GHI due to post-receptor defects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3726085757\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who meet the clinical and laboratory parameters outlined above, we suggest testing for mutations in the genes that cause GHI. The first priority is testing for a mutation in the GH receptor gene (Laron syndrome) since this is the most common cause of GHI. Other tests can be selected as indicated by the clinical and biochemical profile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>). These include evaluation for IGF-I gene mutations in individuals with severe prenatal growth failure and elevated IGFBP-3 levels (see <a href=\"#H12574578\" class=\"local\">'IGF-I gene mutations'</a> above), or signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B) gene mutations in patients who also have immunodeficiency (see <a href=\"#H4965236\" class=\"local\">'GH receptor signal transduction'</a> above). Testing that focuses on specific mutations is limited by the known causes of GHI. </p><p>Specific testing for these mutations is available through some clinical laboratories, which are listed on the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=wEsKVFvqlKzpT+qOtddW/y3+Lj0shalBW+L1ZyL4tryNPgji1PaJ6Kbd/o1hE9A6&amp;TOPIC_ID=15796\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Genetic Testing Registry</a> website. Whole exome sequencing (WES) also may be used, and sometimes discovers mutations not identified by candidate-gene methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, interpretation of the WES results can be challenging, since the pathogenicity of a novel variant is often unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Decisions about whether and how to perform molecular testing should be made by a specialist in these disorders. GH stimulation testing usually is not necessary because the basal levels of GH are normal or high in patients with GHI, distinguishing them from individuals with GH deficiency. If GH stimulation testing is performed, the GH response to stimulation is usually robust.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266892585\"><span class=\"h2\">IGF-I generation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If molecular testing is not available, an IGF-I generation test can be used to confirm the diagnosis of GHI and helps to predict responsiveness to recombinant IGF-I therapy. This consists of a brief trial of GH administration for about one week. In patients with GHI, the low baseline IGF-I will not rise after exogenous administration of GH for four to nine days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the protocols for performing this test have not been standardized, the levels of IGF-I achieved are quite variable, and it may be difficult to obtain insurance authorization for the GH required for this short course of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/growth-hormone-insensitivity-syndromes/abstract/37,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41</a>]. Therefore, this is not used routinely to evaluate patients with suspected GHI.

These rare syndromes are characterized by normal or elevated levels of GH and low levels of IGF-I (except for IGF-I receptor mutations, in which IGF-I levels are increased or normal) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12573712\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laron syndrome is the most common cause of GHI and caused by mutations in the GH receptor gene. Affected patients have severe postnatal growth failure, characteristic facies, and metabolic abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80534\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80534 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70163 \">table 2</a>). Most cases are from populations with Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ancestry (including a population in Ecuador), and a family history of consanguinity is common. (See <a href=\"#H12574092\" class=\"local\">'Growth hormone receptor mutations (Laron syndrome)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laron syndrome should be suspected in patients with severe growth failure and low IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein&nbsp;3 (IGFBP-3) levels, especially if GH levels are normal or increased. The diagnosis can be confirmed if a brief trial of GH therapy fails to cause a rise of serum IGF-I (IGF-I generation test), or through genetic testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112625\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112625 \">algorithm 1</a>). These tests can also help to identify and categorize other causes of primary GHI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12573705\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1886144131\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with marked prenatal growth failure, an IGF-I gene mutation should be considered. Like patients with GH receptor mutations, these patients will have normal or increased levels of GH and low IGF-I levels. Unlike patients with GH receptor mutations, the plasma IGFBP-3 level is elevated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62441 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12574578\" class=\"local\">'IGF-I gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cause of GHI has not been established, we suggest a trial of GH therapy before considering IGF-I replacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112625\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112625 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some of these children have partial GHI and may respond to GH (if given at higher doses than for the typical patient with GH deficiency). If GH is effective, it is preferable to IGF-I. Patients who do not respond can proceed to treatment with IGF-I. (See <a href=\"#H4219222800\" class=\"local\">'Trial of growth hormone'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with severe GHI (defined as height and basal IGF-I &le;-3.0 standard deviation [SD], with normal or elevated levels of GH) due to Laron syndrome or most other known defects, we recommend treatment with IGF-I (mecasermin) rather than GH or no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of recombinant IGF-I, particularly in younger children. IGF-I is ineffective for patients with IGF-I mutations. (See <a href=\"#H12573649\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most short patients with normal GH levels do not have one of these GHI syndromes and are classified as having idiopathic short stature rather than GHI.
