Several studies have attempted to address these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Danish nationwide cohort study in which patients with type 2 diabetes were compared with an age-, gender-, and residence-matched cohort, the rates of both community-based antibiotic prescriptions (364 versus 275 per 1000 person-years; adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 1.24, 95% CI 1.23-1.25) and hospital-treated infections (58 versus 39 per 1000 person-years; aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.47-1.52) were higher in diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the community-treated patients, the highest aRRs were seen with cephalosporins (aRR 1.95, 95% CI 1.32-2.86) followed by antimycobacterial agents (aRR 1.69, 95% CI 1.36-2.09) and fluoroquinolones (aRR 1.41, 95% C I 1.26-1.59). The rates of hospital-treated infections were the highest for emphysematous cholecystitis (aRR 1.74, 95% CI 1.56-1.94), abscesses (aRR 1.62, 95% CI 1.55-1.69), and tuberculosis (aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.25-2.06).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study from the Netherlands assessed the number of infections in treated type 2 diabetics cared for in a general practice during a two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Four hundred and fifty-eight infections occurred in 193 patients for a mean of 2.4 infections per patient (&plusmn; 1.9). Mean glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting glucose levels were equivalent among groups who were and were not infected, although patients with infection had higher mean glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations when infected compared with their own values when not infected. The authors concluded that hyperglycemia might be a result rather than the cause of infections in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Norwegian investigators evaluated risk factors for a poor outcome of bacteremia in hospitalized patients in two periods, 1974 to 1979 and 1988 to 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Diabetes was a significant risk factor during the first but not the second period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes is a risk factor for worse clinical course and outcome in patients with endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both allograft rejection and risk for infection appeared to be higher in transplant recipients with diabetes in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In one of these studies, the risk of serious infection was higher in diabetic heart transplant recipients in the early postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the other study, diabetic renal transplant recipients had a greater risk of acute allograft rejection and infection when perioperative glycemic control was poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of perioperative outcomes of over one million patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty in the United States found that patients with controlled diabetes had more urinary tract infections compared with patients without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes also had more urinary tract infections and more overall infections than nondiabetics. In addition, patients with uncontrolled diabetes undergoing joint surgery had more overall infections and urinary tract infections than patients with controlled diabetes.</p><p/><p>As illustrated by the above studies, whether or not hyperglycemia imposes an independent risk for infection is an unresolved question. Many of the studies addressing this question have focused on the risk of postoperative infection following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with mixed results. Three studies support an increased risk of postoperative infection associated with postoperative hyperglycemia among diabetics undergoing CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In none of these studies was mortality increased, and in one study postoperative hyperglycemia was correlated with a higher risk of infection, whereas an elevated hemoglobin A1c was not a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>However, one retrospective study of 1574 patients undergoing CABG at a single institution found no increase in mortality or rates of infection among those with higher postoperative glucose levels; 35 percent of patients in this series had a diagnosis of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, increased glucose concentrations were associated with increased hospital charges and a longer postoperative stay.</p><p>An association between diabetes and an increased risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) has long been known to exist. A study involving 1561 patients undergoing general and vascular surgery found that postoperative hyperglycemia was significantly associated with the development of a surgical site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. After multivariate adjustment for other factors such as age, emergency status, American Society of Anesthesiologists preoperative classification score, and operative time, postoperative hyperglycemia remained the sole risk factor for an SSI in general surgery patients. There appeared to be a linear relationship between the degree of elevation in postoperative glucose concentrations and the risk of an SSI. This study was limited by its retrospective design. In addition, postoperative glucose levels were not measured in approximately a quarter of patients and, for unclear reasons, the authors were unable to show a similar association in patients undergoing vascular surgery.</p><p>The findings in the study described above, however, are similar to a prospective study of 1000 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgical procedures, which found that a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), postoperative hyperglycemia, multiple procedures during one operative visit, and female gender were independently associated with development of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Increased risk of infection was not related to degree of chronic glucose control as measured by hemoglobin A1c, but it was associated with postoperative hyperglycemia in patients with or without a history of DM. The risk of infection correlated with the degree of hyperglycemia such that, compared with patients with glucose &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> those with glucose values of 200 to 249, 250 to 299, or &ge;300 had odds ratios of SSI of 2.54, 2.97, and 3.32, respectively.</p><p>In a separate multivariable logistic regression analysis of 49,817 patients undergoing major vascular surgery identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files, diabetes was significantly associated with the odds of developing a surgical site infection after hospital discharge but not during the initial in-hospital period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that improved glucose control during the operative and perioperative period can reduce the risk of postoperative infections in diabetics undergoing cardiac surgery. In a prospective study of 2467 consecutive diabetic patients undergoing open heart surgery, administration of continuous intravenous infusions of insulin to maintain glucose levels &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was associated with a significant reduction in glucose levels and fewer deep sternal wound infections (0.8 percent versus 2 percent) compared with administering sliding scale subcutaneous insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials plus six cohort studies similarly concluded that glycemic control with a continuous insulin infusion to maintain glucose levels &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was associated with lower surgical site infection rates post cardiac surgery compared with subcutaneous insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>It is likely that the association between diabetes and the risk of SSIs is related to the deleterious effect of hyperglycemia on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and adherence of granulocytes.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia-related impairment of immune response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular disease is common in diabetes. When present, vascular insufficiency may result in local tissue ischemia that, in turn, enhances the growth of microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms while simultaneously depressing the oxygen-dependent bactericidal functions of leukocytes. Vascular disease related to diabetes may also impair the local inflammatory response and the absorption of antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Vascular insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor local trauma in patients with diabetes-associated peripheral neuropathy may result in skin ulcers, which, in turn, lead to diabetic foot infections. Skin lesions in such patient are often either unnoticed or ignored until infection occurs. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Sensory peripheral neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diabetes-associated autonomic neuropathy may develop urinary retention and stasis that, in turn, predispose them to develop urinary tract infections. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diabetes, particularly those who inject insulin daily, often have asymptomatic nasal and skin colonization with <em>S. aureus</em>. Furthermore, diabetic patients who are colonized with <em>S. aureus</em> are more likely to have a methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> isolate than a susceptible one. Colonization may predispose diabetic patients to cutaneous or incisional staphylococcal infections as well as transient bacteremia, which may then result in infection at distant sites such as damaged muscle. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Increased skin and mucosal colonization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with diabetes who have poor glycemic control are more prone to vulvovaginal candidiasis than euglycemic women. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Increased skin and mucosal colonization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several organism-specific factors that predispose diabetics to infection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Glucose-inducible proteins promote adhesion of <em>Candida albicans</em> to buccal or vaginal epithelium. This adhesion, in turn, impairs phagocytosis, giving the organism an advantage over the host.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ketone reductases allow <em>Rhizopus</em> spp, which cause mucormycosis, to thrive in high glucose, acidic conditions typically present in diabetic patients with ketoacidosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Organism-specific factors'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mor A, Berencsi K, Nielsen JS, et al.
