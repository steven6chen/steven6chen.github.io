This is because living donors are physiologically and hemodynamically normal; hence, the graft is not exposed to ischemic alterations associated with brain death or cardiac death in deceased donors. Also, transplantation can be scheduled electively, with both donor and recipient surgeries coordinated at the same facility. This minimizes cold ischemia time for the donated kidney.</p><p>In ideal circumstances, kidney transplantation from a living donor is preemptive, so that the recipient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) avoids the complications of dialysis altogether. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient#H255110068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Timing of transplantation referral'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-transplantation-in-diabetic-nephropathy#H1212465762\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal transplantation in diabetic nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pre-emptive transplantation and living-donor versus deceased kidneys'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation#H1897839493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Preemptive transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>Healthy donors are exposed to some, albeit limited, medical and surgical risks, as well as some degree of postoperative pain.

Thus, with either a planned open or laparoscopy-assisted technique, the patient is placed left-side up in lateral decubitus position, with elevation of the kidney bar of the operating table. Some surgeons also flex the table. A chest roll is usually placed caudal to the axilla to prevent compression injuries of axillary structures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-positioning-for-surgery-and-anesthesia-in-adults#H2993592731\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient positioning for surgery and anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Nerve injuries associated with the lateral decubitus position'</a>.) </p><p>When the recipient is ready and the donor kidney has been completely mobilized, the patient may be heparinized (eg, 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span> before clamping the renal vessels, although this practice varies in individual centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-living-kidney-donors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. After the heparin has circulated (if it has been used), the renal artery and vein are separately clamped and divided, and the kidney is removed. The renal artery and vein stumps are then individually oversewn. Residual heparin can be reversed with protamine once the kidney has been removed (before or after the renal vessel stumps are oversewn, depending upon the condition of the vessels and surgeon preference). After hemostasis is ensured, the wound is closed.

Advantages of laparoscopic nephrectomy include significantly less pain and a shorter recovery period and hospital stays without increased complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-living-kidney-donors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>A variation of the open nephrectomy technique is the minimally invasive nephrectomy, with a smaller, more anterior subcostal small incision that leaves the 12<sup>th</sup> rib intact. This approach has also been associated with less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stays than the traditional open procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-living-kidney-donors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] but more pain and longer hospital stays than the laparoscopic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-living-kidney-donors/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. There have been several reports of robot-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, although it is not clear whether there are any additional advantages for this technique (eg, less blood loss) compared with conventional laparoscopic nephrectomy.

We employ a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to achieve tracheal intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation. We also use a short-acting opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sufentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sufentanil</a>) to attenuate the stress response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, and as a component of a balanced anesthetic technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Maintenance of general anesthesia may be achieved with either a potent volatile inhalation agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>) or with a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA) technique. A NMBA is administered to reduce the intraabdominal pressure needed for the desired degree of abdominal distention.</p><p>We avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> in living kidney donors because of theoretical renal toxicity due to an inorganic fluoride ion metabolite and formation of a substance known as &quot;Compound A&rdquo;. However, sevoflurane has not been associated with clinically significant renal injury, and it has been used safely in patients with chronic stable renal insufficiency and in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-patient-on-dialysis#H335734360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the patient on dialysis&quot;, section on 'Inhalation versus total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.) Also, we avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) because it may cause bowel distention that interferes with the surgical view and procedural tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-living-kidney-donors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and its potential contribution to postoperative nausea and vomiting.

However, we avoid all nephrotoxic agents in order to preserve function in the remaining kidney. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33975874\"><span class=\"h3\">Protection of the donor kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk to the kidney that is being transplanted is ischemia, which can be associated with delayed graft function in the recipient.

We prevent decreases in renal perfusion by maintaining intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP), as well as avoiding high intraabdominal pressure. Specific measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low insufflation pressures during laparoscopy</strong> &ndash; During laparoscopy, the pneumoperitoneum pressure created with insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is kept &lt;15 mmHg to avoid decreased perfusion to the kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deceased-and-living-donor-renal-allograft-recovery#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deceased- and living-donor renal allograft recovery&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopic-assisted technique'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravascular volume expansion </strong>&ndash; Intravascular volume is expanded with intravenous (IV) fluid throughout the procedure in order to maintain optimal renal perfusion and continuous urine output exceeding 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. Volume requirements may be greater in patients undergoing laparoscopic compared with open nephrectomy because of the need to counteract adverse effects on renal blood flow caused by increased intraperitoneal pressure during CO<sub>2</sub> gas insufflation. Thus, a living kidney donor will typically receive 4 to 6 L of isotonic fluids during a laparoscopic nephrectomy procedure.

However, maintenance of adequate MAP is extremely important. Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> may be administered in bolus doses of 5 to 25 mg in order to treat hypotension by combined beta and alpha agonism if volume administration is ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-living-kidney-donors/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Furthermore, insufflation of CO<sub>2 </sub>may result in hypercapnia. Thus, we increase minute ventilation by 20 to 30 percent.

In most patients, adequate control of postoperative pain is achieved with epidural analgesia or PCA with opioids.
