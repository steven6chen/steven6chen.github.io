Glucocerebroside (also called glucosylceramide) and several related compounds that are ordinarily degraded to glucose and lipid components accumulate within the lysosomes of cells.</p><p>GD is one of several inherited metabolic disorders that can be treated by replacement of the deficient enzyme (enzyme-replacement therapy). Early identification is crucial to improving ultimate outcome because early treatment can prevent development of irreversible complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, genetics, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of GD are discussed here. The initial assessment, routine monitoring, and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-initial-assessment-monitoring-and-clinical-course\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Initial assessment, monitoring, and clinical course&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H792429\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GD is one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases. It occurs in approximately 1 in 75,000 births worldwide but is more prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi-Jewish descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent and occurs with greater frequency in the Ashkenazi-Jewish population. Types 2 and 3 are less common and occur in all ethnic types. There were approximately 20,000 individuals with GD in the United States in the mid-1990s, based upon a gene frequency study, two-thirds of whom were Ashkenazi Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of patients have GD1, which is the nonneuronopathic form. GD1 is the most common type seen in the Ashkenazi-Jewish population, although most patients with GD1 are not Jewish. The carrier frequency in the Ashkenazi-Jewish population is approximately 1 in 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and the frequency of disease-associated genotypes is calculated at 1 in 850 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of GD1 is much lower in non-Jewish populations, occurring in approximately 1 in 40,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] to 1 in 86,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] livebirths.</p><p>Type 2 GD (GD2, also called acute neuronopathic GD or infantile cerebral GD) has an estimated incidence of 1 in 150,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This subtype is not prevalent, comprising approximately 1 percent of patients in the Gaucher Registry, as a result of the very short lifespan of patients with GD2.</p><p>The estimated incidence of type 3 GD (GD3, also called subacute or juvenile neuronopathic GD) is 1 in 200,000, but the prevalence is considerably greater than type 2 disease (approximately 7 percent of all patients with GD) because of the longer survival of these patients. GD3 is panethnic but with well-studied clusters in Northern Europe, Egypt, and East Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The three types of GD are thought to represent a continuum from severely affected collodion baby through acute and chronic neuronopathic to Parkinson disease manifestations in nonneuronopathic and mild adult nonneuropathic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GD results from deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase or acid beta-glucosidase, GBA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. GBA is a glycoprotein enzyme whose major substrate is glucocerebroside, a component of the cell membrane that is distributed widely in many organs. In the normal lysosome, the protein saposin C is thought to present glucocerebroside to GBA and thereby activate the enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In affected patients, the deficiency of GBA leads to accumulation of glucocerebroside and other glycolipids within the lysosomes of macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The tissue levels of these compounds may be increased 20 to 100 times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a murine model, there was also secondary accumulation of di- and trihexosyl ceramide in lipid rafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The deacylated form of glucosylceramide, glucosylsphingosine, is particularly elevated in neuronopathic disease and may have a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of GD result from the accumulation of the lipid-laden macrophages in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, bone, and other <span class=\"nowrap\">tissues/organs</span>. However, pathologic lipid accumulation in macrophages accounts for less than 2 percent of the additional tissue mass in the liver and spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The additional increase is attributed to an inflammatory and hyperplastic cellular response. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are not understood, Gaucher cells and neighboring macrophages overexpress and secrete lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-10, macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP) 1alpha and 1beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], and chemotactic factors cysteine-X-cysteine motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 2, 9, 10, and 11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The Gaucher cells exhibit the secretory phenotype of the so-called &quot;alternatively activated&quot; macrophage. This phenotype is often associated in other conditions with chronic inflammation, healing, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A mouse model of GD suggests that other cell types are affected, including thymic T cells, dendritic cells, and osteoblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Activation of complement C5a and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) has been implicated in the control of Gaucher cell accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Several pathologic processes occur within bone: decreased mineral density, marrow infiltration, and infarction of bone. The mechanisms leading to decreased bone mineral density are uncertain, but they may involve failure to achieve peak bone mass, abnormal osteoclast regulation, or overproduction of cytokines by activated macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Marrow fibrosis and osteosclerosis result in localized loss of hematopoiesis. In an in vitro model of GD, primitive hematopoiesis and proliferation of mesenchymal progenitors were impaired, suggesting that cytopenias are due an intrinsic defect in addition to hypersplenism and bone marrow infiltration with Gaucher cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In another in vitro study, mesenchymal stem cells from patients with GD had impaired capacity to develop into osteoblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thrombocytopenia results from splenic sequestration and occasionally marrow failure. The increased bleeding tendency in patients with GD1 is related to thrombocytopenia, coagulation abnormalities, and defective platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Several cases of acquired von Willebrand disease have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Variations in other enzyme pathways, including glucosyl ceramide synthetase, may account for some of the heterogeneity in the severity of presentation of GD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8072432\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GD is an autosomal recessive disorder that is due to mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (also called acid beta-glucosidase, <em>GBA</em>) gene located on chromosome 1q21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The gene is 7.6 kb in length and is composed of 11 exons. A 5 kb unprocessed pseudogene is located 16 kb downstream and is transcriptionally active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Care must be taken in molecular diagnosis and research to avoid analysis of the pseudogene and its transcripts in place of the active <em>GBA</em> gene.</p><p>More than 200 distinct <em>GBA</em> gene mutations are listed in the <a href=\"http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php&amp;token=w7p0LC3/+c5TTfDIkVSPKuXOHlNonGDNq2foBOcxWHjS2ipCxB5EMN1sOeOrxH2h&amp;TOPIC_ID=2918\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Human Gene Mutation Database</a>. More than 80 percent of these mutations are single-nucleotide substitutions.

There is a genotype-phenotype correlation in that the presence of the c.1226A&gt;G mutation in either a homozygous or compound heterozygous form leads to type 1 GD (GD1), rather than a neurologic phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The c.1226A&gt;G mutation is encountered commonly in non-Jewish Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews (gene frequency 0.032) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The c.1448T&gt;C allele (L444P mutation), which accounts for 18 percent of mutant alleles in the Gaucher Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], is common in northern Sweden and elsewhere in Northern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patients homozygous for the c.1448T&gt;C allele tend to have a severe phenotype, often with neurologic disease (type 2 GD [GD2] and type 3 GD [GD3]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The c.84dupG allele (84GG mutation), which represents approximately 7 percent of mutant alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], results from an insertion at position 84 that causes a frameshift. It is a null mutation (ie, no protein is synthesized). Affected patients are compound heterozygotes generally described with type 1 disease. To date, homozygotes have not been described, presumably because of prenatal lethality. Children who are compound heterozygotes (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">84GG/IVS2+1)</span> have a subacute disease course with progressive pulmonary involvement and death in the first to second decade.</p><p/><p>The c.1226A&gt;G, c.84dupG, IVS2+1G&gt;A and c.1448T&gt;C mutations account for approximately 93 percent of alleles in Ashkenazi patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,36</a>]. The c.1226A&gt;G and c.1448T&gt;C mutations together account for approximately 70 percent of mutant alleles in non-Ashkenazi-European patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Among patients being treated for GD, approximately 25 percent are c.1226A&gt;G homozygotes, whereas c.1226A&gt;G is paired with c.1448T&gt;C, c.84dupG, or a less common mutation in 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mutant allele frequencies are different in Asian populations. As an example, the c.1226A&gt;G mutation was not found in a series of 36 Korean patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Traditional nomenclature within the Gaucher field considers amino acid 1 the first amino acid after the signal peptide. However, Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS)-recommended nomenclature, in which leader sequences are counted in codon numbering, results in the addition of 39 to the traditional residue number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GD involves the visceral organs, bone marrow, and bone in almost all affected patients. Disease severity can range from perinatal lethal to asymptomatic. The presenting features are variable and may occur at any age. GD is categorized into three clinical types that are distinguished by their clinical features, course, and ethnic predilection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56005 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, there is a broad spectrum of findings and overlap within and between types, and intermediate phenotypes are appreciated, suggesting that GD is a spectrum of disease manifestations rather than a disorder with three distinct subtypes.</p><p>Type 1 (GD1, MIM #230800) is distinguished from type 2 (GD2, MIM #230900) and type 3 (GD3, MIM #231000) by the lack of characteristic involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), although studies have documented several neurologic features in type 1 patients that are distinct from those observed in types 2 and 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Symptomatic patients have visceral involvement, bone disease, and bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56005 \">table 1</a>). Fatigue is common, and pubertal delay, with associated delay in growth, may occur. Bone disease is common in all patients, especially those splenectomized for control of hematologic disease.

DNA sequencing of the entire glucosylceramidase or acid beta-glucosidase (<em>GBA</em>) coding region is clinically available as a second-tier test when targeted mutation analysis fails to identify both mutant alleles in a patient with deficient glucocerebrosidase activity.

Recombinant (Rec) alleles resulting from gene rearrangement between exon 9 and 10 of the functional gene and pseudogene, respectively, contain two to four point mutations, including c.1448T&gt;C.

It is caused by deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (also called acid beta-glucosidase, GBA), which results in abnormal accumulation of glycolipids within cellular lysosomes. GD is one of the few inherited metabolic disorders that can be treated by enzyme-replacement therapy. Early identification is crucial to improving ultimate outcome because early treatment can prevent development of irreversible complications. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the <em>GBA</em> gene, located on chromosome 1q21. More than 200 distinct mutations are reported. However, four mutant alleles account for most cases: c.1226A&gt;G (N370S), c.1448T&gt;C (L444P), IVS2+1G&gt;A, and c.84dupG (84GG). The prevalence of these alleles varies with ethnicity. The c.1226A&gt;G mutation is encountered commonly in non-Jewish Europeans and Ashkenazi Jews, whereas c.1448T&gt;C is relatively common in Sweden and Northern Europe. Disease onset, severity, and clinical manifestations vary with the genotype, although the genotype-phenotype correlation is not entirely consistent. (See <a href=\"#H8072432\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20908218\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presenting features of GD are variable and may occur at any age. GD is classified into three clinical types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56005 \">table 1</a>). The visceral organs, bone marrow, and bone are affected in all types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F85527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85527 \">table 2</a>). Type 1 is distinguished from types 2 and 3 by the lack of characteristic involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). GD with neurologic involvement (neuronopathic GD) is designated as type 2 or 3 based on the acute or chronic nature, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of GD is confirmed by the finding of reduced glucocerebrosidase activity in peripheral leukocytes. Diagnosis can also be confirmed by mutation analysis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21233118\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Patrick Deegan, MD, MRCPI, FRCP, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Baldellou A, Andria G, Campbell PE, et al.
