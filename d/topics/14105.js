Most women deliver in the two weeks before or after their due date. About 4 percent of pregnant women deliver on their due date.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Due date calculator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have regular monthly menstrual cycles and know the first day of your last menstrual period, you can determine when your baby is due (estimated due date) and how far along you are in your pregnancy now (estimated gestational age) by using the following calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you do not have regular monthly menstrual cycles or do not know when your last menstrual period started, you will need to have an ultrasound examination to determine your due date. This examination should be done as soon as possible because ultrasounds done after the fifth month of pregnancy are not reliable for predicting due dates. An ultrasound is commonly done to confirm the due date even in women who know their last menstrual period and who have regular periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430222108\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY IS THE DUE DATE IMPORTANT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers use the due date to figure out how far along you are in your pregnancy when you see them, both before and after your due date. A lot of decisions are based upon this information. For instance, deciding when to do certain lab tests or other tests on you or your baby and whether labor is starting too early or too late. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"topicVersionRevision\">Topic 6733 Version 10.0</div></div>","outline":"<div id=\"outlineSections\"><h2>Topic Outline</h2><ul id=\"innerOutline\"><li><a href=\"#H1\" id=\"outline-link-H1\">WHAT IS MY DUE DATE?</a><ul><li><a href=\"#H2\" id=\"outline-link-H2\">Due date calculator</a></li><li><a href=\"#H3\" id=\"outline-link-H3\">Ultrasound</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"#H430222108\" id=\"outline-link-H430222108\">WHY IS THE DUE DATE IMPORTANT?</a></li></ul></div><div><h2>CALCULATORS</h2><div id=\"outlineCalculators\"><ul><li class=\"plainItem\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd-patient-education\" title=\"calculator 1\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">Calculator: Estimated date of delivery (EDD) (Patient education)</a></li></ul></div></div>","javascript":null}
