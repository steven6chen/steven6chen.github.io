One study compared 225 patients who had a first MI and experienced one of these complications to 1012 patients with a first MI without these mechanical complications&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Delayed hospitalization (&ge;24 hours), undue in-hospital physical activity, and postinfarction angina increased the risk of rupture in predisposed patients.</p><p>The clinical issues related to these mechanical problems, each of which can result in cardiogenic shock, will be reviewed here.

Several large studies have found cardiac rupture in 14 to 26 percent of such patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75582\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75582 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The incidence is much lower when all patients with acute MI are considered. As an example, the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction published data on 350,755 patients in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of cardiac rupture was less than 1 percent; this is consistent with a 0.85 percent incidence of tamponade in a review of over 100,000 patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial complications of myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac rupture was responsible for 7.3 percent of all deaths and for 12.1 percent among those receiving a fibrinolytic agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death from rupture occurred earlier among patients receiving a fibrinolytic agent, often within 24 hours of drug administration.</p><p/><p>The overall incidence of free wall rupture was approximately four percent in a small, single center study that evaluated patients with STEMI in five-year blocks between 1977 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence declined progressively from 1977 to 1982 (above four percent) to 2001 to 2006 (about two percent). This decline was associated with both a progressive fall in the rate of death (94 to 75 percent) and a progressive increase in the use of reperfusion therapies, better control of blood pressure, and the use of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fibrinolytic therapy accelerates the occurrence of rupture, the TIMI 9 study of 3759 patients found no association between cardiac rupture and the use of adjunctive thrombin inhibitors, including heparin and hirudin, or the intensity of systemic anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The incidence of cardiac rupture may be lower in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention compared to those receiving a fibrinolytic agent. This was suggested in an observational study of 1375 patients who received a fibrinolytic agent or underwent primary angioplasty; the incidence of rupture was 3.3 and 1.8 percent, respectively, with the two therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a multivariate analysis, the use of angioplasty was a significant independent protective factor (odds ratio 0.46).</p><p>Risk factors for myocardial rupture have been identified in addition to fibrinolytic therapy. The Multicenter Investigation of Limitation of Infarct Size (MILIS) study, for example, found that myocardial rupture was 9.2 times more likely to occur in patients with all of the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No history of previous angina or MI</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST-segment elevation or Q wave development on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak MB-creatine kinase above 150 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span></p><p/><p>These associations suggest that the absence of collateral blood flow (suggested by the lack of previous ischemic symptoms) and the size of the infarct are important determinants of the likelihood of myocardial rupture. This hypothesis has been confirmed in other studies that have found that rupture is usually associated with a large transmural infarct, occurs more frequently in patients without previous MI, and is rarely seen in a hypertrophied ventricle or in an area of extensive collateral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-collateral-circulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary collateral circulation&quot;</a>.) In addition, affected patients often have persistent ST segment elevation and persistent or recurrent chest pain with evidence of infarct expansion or extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Other risk factors for rupture include anterior location of the infarction, age &gt;70, and female sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. On the other hand, beta blockers, which are routinely administered to patients with an acute MI, reduce the rate of death from free wall rupture compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial rupture occurs within the first five days after MI in about one-half of cases and within two weeks in over 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. A number of different pathologic patterns can be seen depending in part upon the time of occurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75673\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75673 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This was illustrated by a study of 1450 consecutive patients with acute MI, 27 (1.9 percent) of whom developed free wall myocardial rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The findings were different in early phase (&lt;72 hours) and late (&gt;4 days) ruptures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early rupture was characterized by an abrupt slit-like tear in the infarcted myocardium, with a preference for anterior infarction sites. There was no difference in incidence in between patients treated with conventional and reperfusion therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late rupture was characterized by the presence of infarct expansion, with no preferential infarction site. There was a very low incidence in patients with successful reperfusion.</p><p/><p>Myocardial rupture more frequently involves the left ventricle than the right ventricle, and rarely involves the atria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,19</a>]. The infarct commonly affects the anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle near the junction of the infarcted and normal myocardium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of reperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial rupture after MI is less common in patients with a patent infarct-related coronary artery. Such an association was demonstrated in a retrospective review that evaluated the perfusion status of the infarct-related coronary artery in 57 patients who had an initially nonfatal rupture and 28 patients with a postmortem diagnosis of myocardial rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rupture typically occurred in an area that had been infarcted without successful reperfusion. A coronary angiogram was available in 35 of the 57 patients with initial nonfatal rupture. Complete occlusion or ineffective reperfusion was present in 30 (89 percent). In addition, all 28 patients with a postmortem diagnosis of rupture had inadequate reperfusion of the infarcted area.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that fibrinolytic therapy early after MI improves survival and decreases the risk of cardiac rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The TIMI investigators examined the hearts of 61 patients who died from five hours to 42 days (median of three days) after a fatal first acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this selected group, myocardial rupture (of the left ventricular free wall or septum) was a relatively common complication. However, the frequency of myocardial rupture was lower in the 23 patients who received fibrinolytic therapy than in the 38 patients who did not (22 versus 46 percent). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may also reduce the risk of cardiac rupture if successful reperfusion is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these general findings, fibrinolytic therapy may be associated with a significant increase in free wall rupture in patients &ge;75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a review of 706 consecutive patients &ge;75 years of age with a first STEMI who were treated with primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy, or no reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The patients who received fibrinolytic therapy had a significantly greater likelihood of free wall rupture (17.1 versus 7.9 and 4.9 percent in those with no reperfusion and primary PCI, respectively, adjusted relative risk 3.62 compared to no reperfusion). Free wall rupture accounted for 54 percent of deaths after fibrinolytic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Late reperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A separate issue from the overall efficacy of reperfusion to reduce the incidence of free wall rupture is the value of late therapy. Initial suggestions that late administration of fibrinolytic therapy might increase the risk of cardiac rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] were disproved by the Late Assessment of Thrombolytic Efficacy (LATE) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this study, 5711 patients were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> or placebo 6 to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Late fibrinolysis did not increase the risk of cardiac rupture; it did, however, appear to accelerate the time of onset of rupture events, typically to within 24 hours of treatment.</p><p>In contrast, late primary PCI may be associated with reductions in free wall rupture. These benefits were suggested in a retrospective review of 2209 patients with acute MI treated with primary PCI; clinical outcomes were analyzed after dividing the patients into three groups: early reperfusion (&le;12 hours after presentation), late reperfusion (&gt;12 hours after presentation, mean onset to admission time 17 hours), and failed reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The incidence of free wall rupture in those in the early and late reperfusion groups was significantly lower than for those with failed reperfusion (0.7 and 0.9 versus 3.8 percent).</p><p>Late primary PCI (after 24 hours) of a totally occluded artery has not been shown to improve hard clinical outcomes however. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery patency and outcome after myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Late PCI to open an occluded artery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course of myocardial rupture is variable. </p><p>Rupture can present as sudden death in an undetected or silent MI. With a known MI, complete or <span class=\"nowrap\">incomplete/subacute</span> rupture can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete rupture of the left ventricular free wall usually leads to hemopericardium and death from cardiac tamponade. The presence of rupture is first suggested by the development of sudden profound right heart failure and shock, often progressing rapidly to pulseless electrical activity (electromechanical dissociation) and death. Pulseless electrical activity in a patient with a first MI and without overt heart failure had, in one report, a high predictive accuracy (95 percent) for the diagnosis of left ventricular free wall rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, the predictive accuracy of rupture was low (17 percent) in those with heart failure. Emergent pericardiocentesis will confirm the diagnosis and transiently relieve the tamponade. Transthoracic echocardiography can further confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Incomplete/subacute</span> rupture of the left ventricular free wall can occur when organized thrombus and the pericardium seal the ventricular perforation. This condition can progress to frank rupture with cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic compromise, to formation of a false aneurysm walled off by pericardial tissue and communicating with the left ventricle through the perforation, or to formation of a left ventricular diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15-17,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,31</a>].

Echocardiographic and hemodynamic indices of cardiac tamponade were present in 85 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">incomplete/subacute</span> rupture is confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>The diagnosis is made clinically, with confirmation from transthoracic echocardiography when time allows. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival depends primarily upon the rapid recognition of myocardial rupture and provision of immediate therapy. Patients displaying suggestive symptoms, signs, and ECG changes require a bedside echocardiogram and echocardiographically-guided pericardiocentesis if fluid is visualized. Immediate surgery is indicated if the pericardiocentesis identifies the fluid as blood. Medical therapy aimed at hemodynamic stabilization should also be instituted. This includes fluids, inotropic support, vasopressors, pericardiocentesis, intraaortic-balloon pump counterpulsation, and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass (if available and necessary) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12,15-18,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-18,21,23</a>]. Prompt surgical repair is also indicated for left ventricular false aneurysms because rupture of the pseudoaneurysm can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Rapid institution of the above regimen can lead to an appreciable survival rate, particularly in subacute rupture. In one study, for example, 25 of 33 patients (76 percent) with subacute ventricular rupture survived the surgical procedure and 16 (48 percent) were long-term survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RUPTURE OF THE INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of septal rupture has been reported to be about half that of free wall rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It typically occurs three to five days after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). It may, however, develop within the first 24 hours or as late as two weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased risk of septal rupture may be observed in patients with single-vessel disease (especially the left anterior descending artery), extensive myocardial damage, and poor septal collateral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Septal rupture may also be seen in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,34</a>] and there is a higher prevalence in first infarctions.</p><p>Due to the nature of the septal blood supply, patients with an MI due to occlusion of a &quot;wraparound&quot; left anterior descending (LAD) artery appear to have an elevated risk of septal rupture. In most individuals, the inferior one-third of the septum is supplied by the right coronary artery. In some individuals, however, the LAD extends beyond the left ventricular apex, wrapping around to supply the distal inferior wall and inferior septum.</p><p>In patients with a &quot;wraparound&quot; LAD, an anterior MI due to LAD occlusion can result in more extensive septal infarction and reduced collateral supply to the septum, producing an increased risk of septal rupture and ST elevation in the inferior leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In contrast, patients with a high lateral wall MI are more likely to have reciprocal ST depression in the inferior leads, while other patients have no inferior ST segment changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Based upon these observations, ECG evidence of infarction with a wraparound LAD (inferior ST elevation during a large anterior MI) may identify patients at high risk. In a report comparing 21 patients with an anterior MI and septal rupture to 275 similar patients without septal rupture, the patients with septal rupture were much more likely to have ST segment elevations (43 versus 4 percent) and Q waves (44 versus 4 percent) in all three inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>This series enrolled patients over a 27-year period; as a result, angiography confirming a wraparound LAD was not performed in all patients. ST elevation in a large number of leads predicts a larger infarction regardless of coronary anatomy, and such patients may be at increased of septal rupture.

A pulmonary artery catheter may be an adjunctive diagnostic tool for patients with suspected rupture of the interventricular septum.
