Preventive measures, ranging from improved infection control to protective gear, have been effective in reducing military morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, the rapidity of evacuation and access to higher-quality care have markedly improved survival rates for battle injuries. Clinicians caring for the new generation of combat veterans from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq need to be prepared for a different distribution of injuries than from prior wars. As an example, it is more common to see survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and amputees who have lost multiple limbs (as the torso is often spared by body armor).</p><p>Despite the evolution of war-related injuries over time, there are three aspects of injuries that have not changed for the returning veteran. First, while non-combat injuries (eg, infections, gastrointestinal illness, and musculoskeletal problems not related to battle) have decreased dramatically in recent conflicts, they invariably outnumber combat-related injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Second, the psychological effects of war are greater in number and duration than the physical effects over the long-term. Third, complaints in veterans presenting for care after deployment tend to be similar in distribution and frequency to those in the general primary care population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the overall medical care of the returning veteran may be similar to that of the general population, there are certain issues (eg, TBI, psychological sequelae, readjustment to society following deployment) that are of particular relevance to veterans.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of medical conditions commonly encountered in returning veterans, with a particular emphasis on United States veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. Specific medical conditions associated with combat are discussed in further detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic brain injury: Epidemiology, classification, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796170\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL INJURY DUE TO COMBAT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of combat-related fatalities has decreased over recent wars. This can be attributed to the use of tourniquets, modern body armor, rapid evacuation, early limb salvage, and improved hemostatic resuscitation practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Soldiers with combat injuries, which may have been fatal in previous conflicts, are arriving more rapidly to military treatment facilities in better physiologic condition and are able to receive higher levels of care.</p><p>There are clear differences between military and civilian trauma populations. Whereas blunt trauma, primarily due to motor vehicle accidents and falls, represents the most common injury among civilians in the United States, penetrating injuries are more common in combat casualties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common causes of serious penetrating injuries in civilian trauma centers are stabbings and low-velocity gunshot wounds, whereas in the military they tend to be high-velocity gunshot wounds and high-energy explosive munitions including improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mortars, and rockets which can produce varied fragmentation, concussive blast, and thermal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796184\"><span class=\"h2\">Amputations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of 8056 military casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq found that more than 70 percent were due to extremity injuries severe enough to either result in evacuation from combat or to prevent return to duty within 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some form of explosive device was involved with 88 percent of these injuries. Major injury resulted in amputations proximal to the wrist or ankle in 7.4 percent, compared with 8.3 percent in the Vietnam War, although service members are currently able to survive more serious injuries than in prior wars.</p><p>Amputee care and the quality of prostheses have improved dramatically as a result of efforts to provide combat amputees with maximum function and mobility. Amputees are able to remain on active duty in the military after injuries that they may not have survived in prior wars. Functional capacity assessment can be helpful in determining whether an amputee is able to return to their usual home and work environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is usually performed in conjunction with physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occupational therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disability assessment and determination in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Phantom limb pain is a common symptom following amputations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This may require chronic pain management, including referral to a pain specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3796191\"><span class=\"h2\">Traumatic brain injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of disability among returning veterans. TBI encompasses a broad range of pathologic injuries to the brain of varying clinical severity that result from head trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic brain injury: Epidemiology, classification, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While there is not complete agreement regarding classification, TBI may be best characterized by a combination of the Glasgow Coma Scale score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>), duration of loss of consciousness, and clearly abnormal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Based on these criteria, as many as 99 percent of service members diagnosed with TBI have mild TBI, including transient or no loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mild TBI is difficult to distinguish from other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], as symptoms of mild TBI (eg, concentration impairment, irritability, and headaches) overlap with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Furthermore, veterans with TBI may be at higher risk for PTSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TBI is a diagnosis given at the time of injury, based upon the circumstances of the inciting event, whereas persistent symptoms that may follow mild TBI are described as a postconcussion syndrome. The most common complaints of postconcussion syndrome include headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, and psychological symptoms. Most patients recover quickly from postconcussion syndrome (within several weeks), although a minority have prolonged disability. A brain MRI should be performed to exclude other causes if there are persistent and disabling complaints. In the absence of a defined specific treatment for postconcussion syndrome, symptomatic treatment should be offered, which may include migraine medications, analgesics, psychological counseling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychotropic medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postconcussion-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postconcussion syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Moderate to severe TBI represents only a small fraction of those returning from the wars. Moderate-to-severe TBI usually requires aggressive management and may lead to long-term disability and cognitive dysfunction. A multicenter prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial identified that the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> produced more rapid recovery of neurologic function during the four-week treatment period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the placebo group did show improvement during an ensuing two-week follow-up period, so that the two groups had similar functional status after six weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-severe-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute severe traumatic brain injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617393371\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord, penetrating abdominal, and chest injuries are less common than in prior wars, likely due to body armor protecting the trunk and back [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As mentioned above, limb and head trauma are the most common types of injuries in recent wars.

However, an initial screening will miss most cases of mental health problems, and repeated screening is necessary, especially between 3 and 12 months after return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness of screening is unclear. In the only randomized controlled study to address this issue,&nbsp;postdeployment screening of United Kingdom veterans of the Afghanistan War for PTSD, depression or anxiety, and alcohol misuse was not effective in reducing the prevalence of these disorders 10 to 24 months later or in increasing the frequency of help-seeking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These results may not be generalizable, as the screening assessment in this study was done by computer, which may be less effective than a face-to-face interview.</p><p>Of veterans who screen positive for a mental health disorder, less than half seek mental health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There is no evidence to suggest that most available treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders are more or less effective in military service members than in civilians. Multidisciplinary suicide prevention programs designed for injured returning veterans may reduce the number of suicides related to combat-related injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The psychological sequelae of combat are important by themselves but are also associated with increased rates of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341622647\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttraumatic stress disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks of past traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance. As war is outside the realm of normal human experience, battle experiences nearly always fulfill the first criterion for the definition of PTSD (exposure to a severe, traumatic event). The clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria for PTSD are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of PTSD and other mental health disorders varies based on the particular war, the veteran population being studied (eg, gender, branch of military), and when PTSD assessment is being performed (soon after return compared with years later). In a cohort study of 289,328 United States veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who received health care through the Veterans Administration (VA) between 2002 and 2008, the overall prevalence of newly diagnosed PTSD was 21.8 percent, with the rate increasing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. PTSD and other psychological sequelae are being identified at higher rates than has historically been the case, and they are frequently not fully manifest until months or years after return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/17,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24,25</a>].

It is brief and easy to use. It consists of nine items that correspond to the nine DSM-5 criteria for unipolar major depression and one additional item assessing psychosocial impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>).

One anonymous self-report survey of more than 28,000 United States military personnel found that cigarette smoking was the most common adverse behavior (31.7 percent), followed by heavy alcohol use (21.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Illicit drug use excluding prescription drug misuse was reported in 5.2 percent. The rate has declined sharply since 1980, associated with random drug testing and strict intolerance of drug use within military ranks. Although differences in methodology make direct comparisons difficult, rates within the military appear to be no higher than in the general population. However, prescriptions for psychotropic medications, and abuse of prescription medications, have increased markedly in the general population in recent years, and this trend seems to be even more pronounced in the military in association with drawn-out conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. In another study using data from the Veterans Administration (VA) health care system for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan seen for an initial visit between 2001 and 2009, alcohol use disorder was diagnosed in 10 percent, drug use disorder in 5 percent, and both diagnoses in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Over 55 percent of veterans diagnosed with substance use disorder were also diagnosed with either posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression and were 3.0 to 4.5 times more likely to have PTSD or depression than veterans without substance use disorder. Additionally, veterans with mental health diagnoses (and PTSD in particular) were more likely to have chronic pain requiring opioid treatment and were more likely to abuse prescription opioids with adverse health consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. It is important to recognize that an element of selection bias occurs, with healthier individuals who are less likely to engage in illicit drug use tending to remain in active military service at higher rates. Conversely, for those who leave the military, only about one-quarter receive care in the VA system, and they tend to be disproportionately impoverished with more complex health problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].</p><p>The frequency and intensity of tobacco use increases in military populations after deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

If the veteran has symptoms or signs of functional or mobility problems, then physical, occupational, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speech therapy evaluations should be conducted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disability-assessment-and-determination-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disability assessment and determination in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Military members in the United States who have physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mental health conditions that render them unfit to perform their required duties are reviewed by a Medical Evaluation Board. The board consists of active-duty clinicians (not involved in the care of the military member) who review the clinical case file and decide whether the individual should be returned to duty, or should be separated, using published medical standards for continued military service (Army Regulation 40-501 Standards of Medical Fitness, SECNAVINST 1850.4E Navy Disability Evaluation Manual) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. If the member's medical condition falls below medical retention standards, the case is forwarded to a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB). The PEB is a formal fitness-for-duty and disability determination that may recommend return of the member to duty (with or without assignment limitations which are documented and outlined in a &quot;physical profile&quot;), transfer of the member from active duty, or medical retirement of the member temporarily or permanently. The standard used by the PEB for determining fitness is whether the medical condition precludes the member from reasonably performing the duties of his or her office, rank, or position. Military members who are separated or medically retired are given a disability rating by the PEB based off of the Department of Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-of-the-returning-veteran/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p>Most United States military personnel are active-duty service members and are therefore eligible for care within the Department of Defense military treatment facilities upon their return from deployment. However, more than one-quarter of those who have been deployed are National Guard or Reserve service members who are activated specifically for deployment.
