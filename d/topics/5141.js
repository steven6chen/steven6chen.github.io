Immunologic abnormalities, especially the production of a number of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), are a prominent feature of the disease.</p><p>Patients present with variable clinical features ranging from mild joint and skin involvement to life-threatening renal, hematologic, or central nervous system involvement. The clinical heterogeneity of SLE and the lack of pathognomonic features or tests pose a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. To complicate matters, patients may present with only a few clinical features of SLE, which can resemble other autoimmune, infectious, or hematologic diseases.</p><p>The diagnosis of SLE is generally based on clinical and laboratory findings, after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the absence of SLE diagnostic criteria, SLE classification criteria are often used by clinicians as guidance to help identify some of the salient clinical features when making the diagnosis. Serological findings are important in suggesting the possibility of SLE, with some antibodies (eg, anti-double-stranded DNA [dsDNA] and anti-Smith [Sm]) highly associated with this condition.</p><p>The approach to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of SLE will be reviewed here. An overview of the symptoms and signs that can occur in SLE, discussions of particular sites of involvement (eg, skin, kidneys, central nervous system), and the treatment and prognosis of SLE are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR SUSPECTED SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) depends on the manner of presentation and the exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Given the heterogeneity of clinical presentations, there are some patients for whom the constellation of presenting clinical features and supportive laboratory studies make the diagnosis of SLE relatively straightforward. By contrast, there are others who present with isolated complaints or infrequent disease characteristics and represent more of a diagnostic challenge. Demographics should also be taken into account when evaluating a patient for SLE, since it occurs primarily in young women of childbearing age. In addition, SLE occurs more commonly in certain racial and ethnic groups, particularly African Americans, Asians, African Caribbeans, and Hispanic Americans, compared with Caucasians. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, the diagnosis of SLE is more likely in a young woman who presents with complaints of fatigue, arthralgia, and pleuritic chest pain and who is found to have hypertension, a malar rash, a pleural friction rub, several tender and swollen joints, and mild peripheral edema. Laboratory testing may reveal leukopenia, anemia, an elevated serum creatinine, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, an active urinary sediment, hypocomplementemia, and positive tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), including those to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the Smith (Sm) antigen. By contrast, another patient may present with leukopenia or single-organ involvement (eg, nephritis or pericarditis). Such patients may subsequently develop the characteristic multisystem features of SLE over a period of months or years.

Patients presenting with symptoms for a shorter duration of time will need close follow-up, as the frequency with which various features of SLE observed differ according to stage of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H615916089\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the broad range of clinical manifestations of SLE, it is helpful to consider the various features according to frequency at disease onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70386 \">table 1</a>).

These criteria can be useful for clinicians in systematically documenting key disease features, but their imperfect sensitivity and specificity limits their use for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>In 2012, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) proposed revised classification criteria that were developed to address inherent weaknesses of the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As an example, one of the major limitations of the 1997 ACR criteria is that patients with biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis could still fail to fulfill criteria. Other concerns regarding the ACR criteria included the possible duplication of highly correlated cutaneous features (such as malar rash and photosensitivity), the lack of inclusion of other cutaneous manifestations (such as maculopapular or polycyclic rash), and the omission of many neurologic manifestations of SLE (such as myelitis). The ACR criteria also did not include relevant immunologic information such as low serum levels of complement components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H914033\"><span class=\"h2\">2012 SLICC criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A consensus group of experts on SLE, the SLICC, has proposed revised criteria for SLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F86633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86633 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Classification as having SLE by the SLICC criteria requires either that a patient satisfy at least 4 of 17 criteria, including at least 1 of the 11 clinical criteria and one of the six immunologic criteria, <strong>or</strong> that the patient has biopsy-proven nephritis compatible with SLE in the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) or anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies.</p><p>The SLICC criteria were validated by analysis of 690 patients with SLE or other rheumatic diseases. In this initial validation testing, the SLICC revised criteria had greater sensitivity but lower specificity than the 1997 ACR classification criteria (sensitivity of 97 versus 83 percent and specificity of 84 versus 96 percent, respectively).</p><p>However, despite the improved sensitivity compared with the ACR criteria, the SLICC criteria might delay the diagnosis of SLE in a significant number of patients, and some patients might not be classified at all. These situations were demonstrated in a study in which patients were grouped according to whether the SLICC criteria were met before, at the same time as, or after the ACR criteria, and the groups were then compared. Out of 622 patients, 319 (50 percent) were classified at the same time using either criteria set, 78 (12 percent) earlier and 225 (35 percent) later (mean 4.4 years) with the SLICC criteria than with the ACR criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among the patients diagnosed later with the SLICC criteria, in the majority of cases, the delay was due to the combination of malar rash and photosensitivity into the acute cutaneous SLE criterion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690922894\"><span class=\"h2\">1997 ACR criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previously, most clinicians relied for the diagnosis of lupus upon the classification criteria that were developed by the American Rheumatism Association (ARA, now the ACR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73334 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The criteria were established by cluster analyses, primarily in academic centers and primarily in Caucasian patients.</p><p>The patient is classified with SLE using the ACR criteria if four or more of the manifestations are present, either serially or simultaneously, during any interval of observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

This is often challenging due to the great variability in the expression and severity of SLE. Although the classification criteria were designed for research purposes, many clinicians refer to aspects of these criteria when making the diagnosis of SLE.

Up to one-third of patients have all symptoms and signs disappear over a 10-year follow-up period. Anywhere from 40 to 60 percent of patients continue to exhibit their initial clinical features, while 5 to 30 percent evolve and meet classification criteria for a definite disease, such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), scleroderma, or an inflammatory myopathy (myositis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undifferentiated-systemic-rheumatic-connective-tissue-diseases-and-overlap-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases and overlap syndromes&quot;</a>). Thus, patients with UCTD should be followed carefully, encouraged to report new symptoms, and have periodic laboratory testing to assess for the emergence of new clinical features or laboratory findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173671\"><span class=\"h2\">ANA-negative lupus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ANA-negative SLE has been recognized since the 1970s, but was later shown to be influenced by the testing methods used to detect ANA. At that time it was estimated that about 5 percent of patients with SLE were ANA-negative by indirect immunofluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, this negative finding occurred because sera were tested using rodent and not human tissues as the substrate for the indirect immunofluorescence test for ANA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. By comparison, anti-Ro antibodies were found in many of these patients when a human cell line extract was used as substrate for anti-Ro antibody testing.</p><p>The subsequent substitution of HEp2 cells (a human cell line) for rodent tissue sections in the indirect immunofluorescence ANA assay has resulted in even fewer SLE patients with negative ANA by indirect immunofluorescence. Nevertheless, on rare occasions, the presence of anti-Ro antibodies may suggest a systemic autoimmune disease, despite the presence of a negative ANA indirect immunofluorescence. As an example, in one study in Sweden, among 4025 sera tested for ANA, 64 patients with negative ANA by indirect immunofluorescence had anti-Ro antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Of these 64 patients, 12 had SLE and five had cutaneous LE.</p><p>The clinician should understand the technique used to detect the ANA since this can influence the result. As an example, a negative ANA by indirect immunofluorescence is clinically useful as it dramatically decreases the likelihood of SLE. On the other hand, in a patient with a strong clinical suspicion for SLE and a negative ANA result by a solid phase assay, the test should be repeated using indirect immunofluorescence method with Hep-2 cells given the increased risk of a false negative result for the initial ANA test by solid phase assay. A detailed discussion of the methods used to detect ANA is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other factors that may also influence ANA negativity in SLE patients include disease duration and treatment exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In our experience, the frequency of ANA-negative SLE is lower in patients presenting at an early stage of their disease. In addition, SLE patients who have longstanding disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have undergone treatment may lose ANA reactivity and become serologically negative over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the protean manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the differential diagnosis is correspondingly broad. While it is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive list of all possible alternative diagnoses, we present several here.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</strong> &ndash; Early RA may be difficult to distinguish from the arthritis of SLE since both conditions cause joint tenderness and swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54324 \">table 4</a>). Features such as swan neck deformities, ulnar deviation, and soft tissue laxity, which are observed in later stages of RA in patients with more destructive disease, can also be seen in some patients with SLE. However, important distinguishing features are that the joint deformities in SLE are often reducible, and infrequently erosive on plain radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some extraarticular RA manifestations, including serositis, sicca symptoms, subcutaneous nodules, anemia, and fatigue, are other features that may also be observed in SLE. These features are more common in RA patients with more severe or advanced disease. Serologic abnormalities such as the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) are more supportive of the diagnosis of RA, and can help distinguish the diseases. It should be recognized that the antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may be positive in up to one-half of patients with RA. Conversely, rheumatoid factor (RF) may be present in approximately one-third of SLE patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rhupus</strong> &ndash; The term rhupus has been used to describe patients with overlapping features of both SLE and RA. Whether rhupus is clinically and immunologically a distinct entity, a true overlap of SLE and RA, or a subset of patients with SLE remains a matter of debate. In addition to having serologies consistent with both SLE and RA, some patients classified as rhupus may have an erosive arthropathy that is atypical for SLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undifferentiated-systemic-rheumatic-connective-tissue-diseases-and-overlap-syndromes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases and overlap syndromes&quot;, section on 'Early undifferentiated systemic rheumatic disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)</strong> &ndash; MCTD is characterized by overlapping features of SLE, systemic sclerosis (SSc), and polymyositis (PM), and by the presence of high titers of antibodies against U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP). However, the diagnosis of MCTD is often complicated since many of its characteristic features occur sequentially, often over a period of years. In addition, some patients with MCTD may evolve into another connective tissue disease, including SLE, during the clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

These patients may have symptoms such as arthritis and arthralgias, Raynaud phenomenon, and serological findings that are difficult to distinguish from early phases of SLE. The majority of patients with UCTD maintain an undefined profile and have a mild disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

By contrast, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias, calcinosis, and malignant hypertension with acute renal failure are more consistent with SSc rather than SLE. Further, a positive ANA is present in most patients with SSc, while other serologies such as anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith (Sm) antibodies which are more specific for SLE, are not commonly observed in SSc. Correspondingly, patients with SSc commonly express antibodies to an antigen called Scl-70 (topoisomerase I) or antibodies to centromere proteins. Distinguishing SSc from SLE can be particularly difficult in cases where there is overlap of these diseases, such as in MCTD.

However, patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome should have objective signs of keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia, and characteristic findings on salivary gland biopsy which are not typical of SLE. Also, patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome commonly express antibodies to Ro and La antigens.

However, patients with these types of vasculitides are usually ANA-negative. Rather, these patients frequently display antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA).

Other overlapping features include inflammatory eye disease, neurologic disease, vascular disease, and arthritis. However, patients with Beh&ccedil;et's are more commonly male and ANA-negative. Also, vascular involvement of any size (small, medium, large) is more commonly a feature of Beh&ccedil;et's syndrome rather than SLE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-behcet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM)</strong> &ndash; Patients with SLE can present with a low-grade myositis, whereas patients with DM and PM generally demonstrate more overt proximal muscle weakness. A positive ANA is observed in approximately 30 percent of patients with DM and PM, compared with almost all patients in SLE. Patients with DM may have characteristic skin findings including Gottron's papules, a heliotrope eruption and photodistributed poikiloderma (including the shawl and V signs). Clinical findings characteristic of SLE such as oral ulcers, arthritis, nephritis, and hematologic abnormalities are absent in DM and PM. Patients with DM or PM may also express myositis-specific antibodies such as anti-Jo-1.

However, patients with ASD often present with a leukocytosis rather than the leukopenia observed in SLE, and they typically are negative for ANA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult Still's disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kikuchi's disease</strong> &ndash; Kikuchi's disease is a benign and usually self-limited form of histiocytic-necrotizing lymphadenitis. Clinical features at presentation include lymphadenopathy as well as fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and, less commonly, hepatosplenomegaly. Associations with SLE have been reported, but the clinical course is usually favorable with spontaneous remission often occurring within four months. The diagnosis of Kikuchi's disease is based on a lymph node biopsy, which reveals a histiocytic cellular infiltrate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kikuchi-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kikuchi disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum sickness</strong> &ndash; Many of the clinical features observed in serum sickness such as fever, lymphadenopathy, cutaneous eruptions, and arthralgias are often observed in SLE. Furthermore, during severe episodes, complement measurements including C3 and C4 can be depressed, as in SLE. Unlike SLE, however, ANAs are typically negative and the course tends to be self-limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibromyalgia</strong> &ndash; Patients with SLE may present with generalized arthralgias, myalgias, and fatigue, much like patients with fibromyalgia. However, other characteristic features of SLE such as a photosensitive rash, arthritis, and multisystem organ involvement are absent. However, fibromyalgia occurs more commonly in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases than in the general population; thus, patients with SLE may have concomitant fibromyalgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infections</strong> &ndash; Several viral infections can produce signs and symptoms present in SLE, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In addition, EBV infection may lead to a positive ANA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Human parvovirus B19 can cause flu-like symptoms and hematologic abnormalities such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which can be observed in SLE, and patients may present with arthralgias or arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other viral infections that may present with multisystem involvement include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, serologic assays can be diagnostic for many of these viruses. Some bacterial infections such as Salmonella or tuberculosis should also be considered if appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</strong> &ndash; Although rare, patients with SLE can present with cranial neuropathies that must be distinguished from MS. Unilateral optic neuritis and pyramidal syndrome, with lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggesting dissemination in space and time are characteristic of MS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancies</strong> &ndash; Leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes may present with hematologic and constitutional symptoms similar to those observed in SLE. However, monoclonal expansion of B and T cells (as assessed by immunophenotyping), monocytosis, or macrocytosis can distinguish these malignancies from SLE. Patients with lymphoma also typically have additional findings such as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) may be distinguished by findings on an excisional tissue biopsy, most commonly a lymph node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</strong> &ndash; Although patients with SLE may have fever and thrombocytopenia, patients with TTP also have microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute renal insufficiency, fluctuating neurological manifestations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low levels of ADAMSTS13. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1829475855\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H541341998\" class=\"local\">'Definite SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Probable SLE</strong> &ndash; There are patients who do not fulfill the classification criteria for SLE, but in whom we still diagnose the disorder. These patients include those presenting with an inadequate number of ACR or SLICC criteria, or those who have other SLE manifestations not included in either classification criteria. (See <a href=\"#H14929732\" class=\"local\">'Probable SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">As a loose guide, we diagnose SLE in patients who have two or three of the ACR or SLICC criteria, along with at least one other feature that may be associated with, but is not specific for, SLE. Some of these features include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Optic neuritis, aseptic meningitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Glomerular hematuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Myocarditis, verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Abdominal vasculitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Raynaud phenomenon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Elevated acute phase reactants (eg, ESR and CRP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Possible SLE </strong>&ndash; We consider SLE a possible diagnosis in individuals who have only one of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACR/SLICC</span> criteria, in addition to at least one or two of the uncommon features listed above. (See <a href=\"#H795279615\" class=\"local\">'Possible SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD)</strong> &ndash; Other patients who have even fewer features suggestive of SLE may be classified as UCTD. This term is used to describe patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of a systemic autoimmune disease but do not meet the ACR criteria for SLE or another defined connective tissues disease. (See <a href=\"#H795279621\" class=\"local\">'Undifferentiated connective tissue disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>ANA-negative SLE</strong> &ndash; Less than 5 percent of patients with SLE are negative for ANA as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The frequency of ANA-negative SLE is even lower in patients presenting at an early stage of their disease. In addition, SLE patients who have longstanding disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have undergone treatment may lose ANA reactivity and become serologically negative over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of SLE is broad. It includes many systemic connective diseases as well as other autoimmune disorders. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359552510\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Peter Schur, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cervera R, Khamashta MA, Font J, et al.
