It can cause changes in skin color, numbness or pain, swelling, and other symptoms. Gangrene is a serious condition. It can be life threatening.</p><p>There are several different types of gangrene:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry gangrene &ndash; In this type, the tissue dries up and falls off. It is most common on the ends of the fingers and toes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wet gangrene &ndash; In this type, the tissue swells up and gets blisters.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gas gangrene &ndash; This type happens when bacteria infect tissue and cause gas bubbles inside it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200649\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of gangrene?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the type of gangrene.</p><p>Symptoms of dry gangrene can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hard, dry skin and tissue </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in skin color &ndash; Skin might look pale or very dark.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that feels cooler than normal</p><p/><p>It can be easy to tell the tissue with dry gangrene from healthy tissue. The area with dry gangrene looks very different from the healthy tissue.</p><p>Symptoms of wet gangrene can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue that looks wet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blisters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that looks dark</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad smell</p><p/><p>Symptoms of gas gangrene can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A numb or heavy feeling in the area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick, like with the flu</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in skin color &ndash; Skin can turn brown, red, or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blisters &ndash; These can look clear or turn red, purple, or blue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue that makes a crackling sound when you press on it</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200664\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have a hard, numb area on a finger or toe. If you have diabetes, tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any skin changes on your feet or have a foot wound that does not heal. You might need treatment to prevent gangrene.</p><p>If you had surgery or an injury, see your doctor or nurse if your pain gets worse in that area, the skin changes color, or you start to feel sick. These could be signs of an infection that could cause gangrene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200679\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. It depends on the type of gangrene and your situation. The doctor or nurse might be able to tell if you have dry or wet gangrene from doing an exam and learning about your symptoms.</p><p>You might also have the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can show gas in the tissue. This can be a sign of gas gangrene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These tests can look for signs of infection. The results can also tell doctors if gangrene or a different condition is causing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to measure blood flow &ndash; These tests can show doctors where problems are happening in blood vessels and how serious the problems are.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200694\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gangrene treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting away dead or dying tissue &ndash; This can sometimes keep gangrene from spreading. A doctor or nurse might need to do this every day for a while.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A kind of surgery called &quot;amputation&quot; &ndash; In this surgery, a doctor removes toes, feet, or other body parts that have gangrene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics given into a vein through a thin tube (called an &quot;IV&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200709\"><span class=\"h1\">Can gangrene be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have diabetes, you can reduce your chances of getting gangrene by keeping your blood sugar close to normal and taking good care of your feet. Having high blood sugar for a long time can cause nerve damage in your feet. You might not notice a foot injury, and then the injury can get infected. This can cause gangrene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200723\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-care-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Foot care in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing complications in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
