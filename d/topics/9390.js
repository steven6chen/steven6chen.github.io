The decision to institute invasive mechanical ventilation in this population is typically based upon a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms in the context of the patient's preferences for life support. While in the past, patients were traditionally intubated late in the course of their acute illness (eg, respiratory arrest) clinical practice now supports earlier intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The majority of patients with acute respiratory failure due to acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) should undergo a trial of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) because intubation can be successfully avoided and mortality reduced with this intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Exceptions include contraindications to NIV, failure of NIV, and severe respiratory distress. These are summarized below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This initial approach can take the form of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) via nasal or full facemask, but can also be approached with oxygen delivered through high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). There are now data in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure that support the use of HFNC as a means of avoiding the need for intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In fact, preliminary data suggest that HFNC may be more effective than NIPPV in avoiding the need for intubation, and is potentially associated with fewer long-term complications than NIPPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Examples of such patients include those with severe respiratory distress who are not suitable for NIV as well as those with agonal breathing, cardiopulmonary arrest, and concurrent severe hemodynamic instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>A bedside scoring system, BAP-65, that uses signs of respiratory distress, along with other risk factors, has been found to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In one study, patients with four risk factors (elevated BUN, altered mental status, pulse &gt;109 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> age &gt;65 years) were more likely to require mechanical ventilation compared to those with none of these risks (55 versus 2 percent). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4514118\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure of noninvasive ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies in patients with AECOPD have shown that deteriorating or unaltered gas exchange despite NIV predicts the need for mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]. In one multicenter prospective trial of 1033 patients with AECOPD, patients with the following features at initial presentation had a greater than 70 percent chance of failing NIV and requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: Glasgow Coma Score &lt;11, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score &ge;29, respiratory rate &ge;30, and pH &lt;7.25. After two hours of NIV, a pH &lt;7.25 further increased the likelihood of need for intubation from 70 to 90 percent. These data together with clinical experience support the need for close monitoring in an intensive care unit for patients with AECOPD initially treated with NIV. Interval evaluation at two hours should be considered so that timely escalation in the level of care from noninvasive to invasive ventilation can be performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87289272\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial blood gas abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with COPD, there are no absolute values on arterial blood gas (ABG) that determine when mechanical ventilation should be instituted. Typically, we consider intubation when the following gas exchange abnormalities are present, particularly after a trial of NIV: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxemia that has not corrected with supplemental oxygen (failure to oxygenate)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe respiratory acidosis, unresponsive to therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> NIV (failure to ventilate)</p><p/><p>Many patients with COPD who present with acute respiratory failure have chronic hypoxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercapnia due to their underlying disease or other comorbid conditions (eg, obesity hypoventilation). The interpretation of an ABG in this population should always be done in the context of prior baseline values when available, and the knowledge of influencing comorbidities. Additionally, paying attention to the presence of mixed acid-base disorders and calculating the predicted pH for acute and chronic acidosis should be done to avoid unnecessary intubation for chronic conditions. For example, a COPD patient with an arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of 100 mmHg may appear alarming to the clinician at the bedside. However, if the pH is near normal (eg, 7.32) or there is evidence of a prior baseline PaCO<sub>2</sub> close to the measured value (eg, 90 mmHg), this suggests that the degree of acute hypercapnia is likely minor and intubation may potentially still be avoided.

Volume-limited modes of ventilation are commonly used, while pressure support or pressure-limited modes are less suitable for patients with airflow limitation. Although the optimal mode is unknown, we typically use the following volume-limited modes: assist control ventilation (ACV), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) or SIMV with pressure support ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">(SIMV/PSV)</span>. Switching modes is not uncommon during the course of a patient's illness particularly when complications of mechanical ventilation such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or barotrauma occur. </p><p>The advantages and disadvantages of the modes of ventilation typically used in patients with acute respiratory failure complicating COPD are reviewed in this section. The details of these modes as well as other modes of mechanical ventilation are reviewed separately.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2407173\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume-targeted modes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume-limited (or targeted) modes of ventilation are modes in which ventilator assisted breaths are triggered by the patient and a set volume is delivered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9410337\"><span class=\"h3\">Assist Control Ventilation (ACV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACV provides a programed number of mandatory breaths (rate set by ventilator) as well as patient-triggered breaths (beyond the set rate) such that each breath is fully supported by the ventilator. </p><p>The key benefit to this mode is the ability to guarantee a predetermined minimum minute ventilation (set tidal volume multiplied by the set ventilator rate), which is generally high in patients with COPD due to abnormally increased physiologic dead space. Thus, ACV can more easily meet this demand. The greatest disadvantage of this mode in patients with COPD is overventilation when the patient is tachypneic and frequently triggering breaths, all of which are mandatory in size. Overventilation can lead to severe respiratory alkalosis and dynamic hyperinflation (DHI), which is often associated with barotrauma, cardiovascular collapse and death. Among all modes, the work of breathing is lowest in patients receiving ACV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, the work of breathing on this mode can still be excessively high if the patient is not adequately sedated, is dyssynchronous with the ventilator, or has excessively high inspiratory flow demands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Thus, in patients with COPD, careful selection of ACV settings (to avoid excessively high minute ventilation), judicious use of sedatives (to decrease respiratory drive and work), and aggressive bedside monitoring (for DHI) are necessary for the success with this mode. (See <a href=\"#H588202\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic hyperinflation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14987250\"><span class=\"h3\">Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IMV units are typically synchronized to patient effort (SIMV) to better accommodate patient demands. Like ACV, SIMV is programmed to deliver a predetermined minimum minute ventilation, and the patient can take additional spontaneous breaths above the set rate. Unlike ACV, each additional &quot;spontaneous&quot; breath is either not supported (IMV alone) or partially supported with pressure support <span class=\"nowrap\">(IMV/PSV)</span>. </p><p>SIMV, with or without pressure support, is an alternative mode for use in patients with COPD who are generating excessively high minute ventilation on ACV. Because not every breath is mandatory and preprogrammed in size, switching from ACV to SIMV can reduce the risk of DHI and its attendant complications. Compared to ACV, this mode has been shown to be associated with greater work of breathing which may offset some of the perceived benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Notably, when patients have stabilized and liberation from mechanical ventilation is being planned, using IMV may be discouraged as the mode is associated with slower weaning from mechanical ventilation when compared to spontaneous breathing trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14987257\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure support ventilation (PSV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In PSV, all breaths are patient triggered and cycled (discontinued), and the volume of spontaneous breaths is augmented with a preset amount of pressure. </p><p>Unlike ACV and SIMV, minute ventilation is determined by patient effort and respiratory mechanics, and consequently, a predetermined minute ventilation is not guaranteed. Work of breathing is also variable with PSV. When compared to unsupported breaths (PSV = 0) and IMV alone, incremental levels of PSV in the low range (ie, between 0 and 60 percent of patient effort) decrease patient effort and work of breathing. However, the incremental benefit diminishes at higher levels of pressure support (&gt;60 percent of patient effort) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71301 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Consistent with this observation, patients with COPD can become more dyssynchronous with the ventilator when higher levels of PSV are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77977\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77977 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>PSV is infrequently used to ventilate patients with COPD. This is, in part, because a predetermined minute volume cannot be set, and reduced work of breathing is not guaranteed with this mode, both of which are desirable in COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, minute ventilation may be insufficient during PSV in patients with COPD because airway resistance is high. High airway resistance results in decreased airflow during inspiration causing inspiration to be terminated early before the optimal tidal volume has been delivered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. PSV also does little to avoid auto-PEEP (the product of dynamic hyperinflation), which when left untreated, can lead to increased patient work and barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

It requires the clinician to set the inspiratory pressure and inspiratory time so that inspiration ends after delivery of the set inspiratory pressure for a set period of time. The volume delivered varies with airway resistance and lung compliance.</p><p>Pressure-limited ventilation is infrequently used in patients with COPD. This is partly because a predetermined minute volume cannot be set (desirable in COPD). In addition, use of this mode in patients with increased airway resistance may result in low minute ventilation and worsening gas exchange, resulting in hypercapnia which is typically undesirable in COPD. Permissive hypercapnia is usually reserved as a rescue mode when peak inspiratory pressures or plateau pressures are uncontrollably high in patients with ARDS but can also provide some room for avoiding dynamic hyperinflation when mechanically ventilating patients with COPD.

The settings will vary according to the cause of acute respiratory failure as well as the mode of mechanical ventilation selected, which is usually assist control ventilation (ACV). Although not absolute, we typically initiate mechanical ventilation with the following initial settings for each mode:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACV &ndash; For patients in whom ACV is chosen as the initial mode of ventilation, we typically use the following settings: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to maintain the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SO<sub>2</sub>) above 92 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tidal volume &ndash; 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (lower starting tidal volumes of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> may be preferred in COPD patients ventilated for ARDS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ventilator rate &ndash; 10 to 16 breaths per minute (target minute ventilation 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) &ndash; 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inspiratory flow &ndash; 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trigger sensitivity &ndash; -1 to -2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O when pressure triggering is used or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> when flow triggering is used</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">SIMV/PSV</span> &ndash; For patients in whom synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support <span class=\"nowrap\">(SIMV/PSV)</span> is chosen as the initial mode of ventilation, we typically use similar settings to ACV with the addition of pressure support (5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) for spontaneous breaths taken by the patient above the set rate.

However, when using PSV alone, achieving the optimal pressure support level can be difficult. This is because the expiratory effort (&quot;fighting the ventilator&quot;), and consequently the respiratory rate, of patients with COPD may increase when the level of support is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The initial settings should be adjusted to satisfy the patient's minute ventilation requirement.

A low tidal volume strategy (eg, 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> is beneficial in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is appropriate for COPD patients who are mechanically ventilated for ARDS. For patients with COPD who are ventilated due to other reasons, tidal volumes in the low range (eg, 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> ventilation may be tried as an initial strategy, although the benefit is less proven. The rationale for this approach is based upon the known high minute ventilation requirements in patients with COPD and the desire to avoid overdistension, dynamic hyperinflation, and lung injury in these patients who are already at risk for these complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Tidal volume'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H506326222\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilator rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal ventilator rate for patients with acute respiratory failure complicating COPD is not established and is largely determined by the patient's native respiratory rate. The ventilator rate (VR) refers to the number of breaths per minute that is set by the clinician on the ventilator (mandatory breaths). The spontaneous rate (SR) refers to the number of breaths per minute that a patient receives beyond the set ventilator rate (non-mandatory breaths). The patient's respiratory rate (RR) refers to the total number of breaths that the patient receives in one minute (RR = VR + SR). Although there is no desired upper or lower limit, we typically aim for RR &lt;25 (ideally &lt;20) and &gt;8 to 10 breaths per minute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Respiratory rate'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During ACV, as a general rule, the VR is often set four breaths per minute less than the RR (eg, VR is set at 16 when the patient's RR is 20 breaths per minute). However, the patient should be monitored closely because a particularly high respiratory rate will decrease the expiratory time. This can worsen dynamic hyperinflation and result in inverse ratio ventilation (ie, inspiratory time is longer than the expiratory time), which is not desirable in COPD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During SIMV, the initial VR is typically set to ensure at least 80 percent of the patient's total minute ventilation (RR multiplied by tidal volume) is delivered by the ventilator. For example, if the patient's minute ventilation is recorded by the ventilator at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> with a set tidal volume of 0.4 L, then the rate would be set at 20 breaths per minute (20 x 0.4 = 8 L).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A ventilator rate is not set during PSV.</p><p/><p>The target rate is frequently adjusted to target a total minute ventilation (tidal volume multiplied by rate) of 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>.

Ideally, the application of extrinsic PEEP should slightly &quot;undermatch&quot; intrinsic PEEP so as to avoid worsening of auto-PEEP. In other words, extrinsic PEEP should never be more than intrinsic PEEP. In practice this is difficult to achieve because intrinsic PEEP is dynamic and fluctuates over time, often decreasing with therapy. While in the past, applied PEEP at levels no greater than 80 percent was advised, given the difficulty of actually measuring intrinsic PEEP in this population together with the dynamic nature of auto-PEEP, and the harmful effects of too much applied PEEP, we typically initially set PEEP at 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and adjust accordingly depending on the patient's course. Alternatively, starting at 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and increasing PEEP only if ineffective trigger efforts are observed can also be effective. Ineffective efforts are due to the patient having to overcome intrinsic PEEP before their effort is sensed by the ventilator. Ineffective efforts can often be alleviated with applied, extrinsic PEEP (provided it is not equal or greater to the intrinsic PEEP), which in turn may actually help to corroborate suspicions regarding the presence of auto-PEEP. For example, resolution of ineffective efforts with applied extrinsic PEEP can help confirm the presence of auto-PEEP and act as a guide to avoid the application of excessive extrinsic PEEP.

In our practice, we use flow triggering in patients receiving IMV and in a subset of patients receiving PSV. We do not have a preference for pressure or flow triggering in patients receiving ACV.

DHI (spontaneous or ventilator-induced) creates elevated levels of auto-PEEP, which can lead to patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and increased work of breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52671\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52671 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59751\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59751 \">figure 6</a>) barotrauma, cardiovascular collapse, and potentially even death.

One practical and reliable method in patients with COPD is the demonstration on ventilator graphics of a progressive rise in peak airway pressures during mandatory tidal volume ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].

In addition, the ability of patients with COPD to successfully be liberated from mechanical ventilation is poorly studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Prognosis appears to be affected by both the severity of the underlying COPD as well as the reason for mechanical ventilation. Poor prognostic factors in this population include failure of noninvasive ventilation, the presence of multiorgan failure and virulent pathogens such as <em>Pseudomonas</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> spp. While earlier studies suggested that mortality was determined by the severity of the underlying disease (eg, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and high Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] score), several studies have since reported that a diagnosis of COPD alone is also a risk factor for death in mechanically ventilated patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective study of 428 patients with acute respiratory failure due to community acquired pneumonia, compared to patients without COPD, patients with COPD had a higher rate of requiring mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR] 2.78, 95% CI 1.6-4.7) and of dying (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.0-1.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-complicating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Common indications for intubation in this population include respiratory distress, failure to respond clinically to noninvasive ventilation, and gas exchange impairment that is unresponsive to medical therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> noninvasive ventilation (failure to oxygenate or ventilate). (See <a href=\"#H14987200\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary objectives of mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD include supporting oxygenation and ventilation, minimizing the work of breathing, and avoiding dynamic hyperinflation (DHI). (See <a href=\"#H14987214\" class=\"local\">'Goals of ventilator management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure complicating COPD, we suggest volume-targeted modes of ventilation over pressure support or pressure-limited modes of ventilation. Among the volume-targeted modes, we prefer assist control ventilation [ACV] or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support <span class=\"nowrap\">[SIMV/PSV]</span>. Switching modes is not uncommon during the course of a patient's illness, particularly when complications of mechanical ventilation occur. (See <a href=\"#H14987242\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator modes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal ventilator settings in patients with acute respiratory failure complicating COPD are those that meet the goals of mechanical ventilation. The initial ventilator settings will vary according to the cause of acute respiratory failure as well as the mode of mechanical ventilation selected. Subsequent adjustments should be made based upon the patient's clinical status, comfort level, gas exchange, and propensity for developing dynamic hyperinflation (DHI). Suggested initial ventilator settings are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H322490005\" class=\"local\">'Initial ventilator settings and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic PEEP (also known as auto-PEEP) is common in patients with COPD who are mechanically ventilated, due to a high prevalence of spontaneous or ventilator-induced dynamic hyperinflation (DHI). Auto-PEEP can result in patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, increased work of breathing, barotrauma, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. (See <a href=\"#H588202\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic hyperinflation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevention and treatment of DHI is primarily achieved through a reduction in respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> or tidal volume, raising the inspiratory flow rate, the application of extrinsic PEEP, and treating underlying airflow obstruction (if present) with bronchodilators and glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H1578897\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with COPD who are mechanically ventilated should also be treated for the primary cause of their respiratory failure. This is especially important for patients with severe airflow obstruction from acute exacerbations of COPD, who should be aggressively treated with bronchodilators, glucocorticoids and antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H16713704\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality of patients with COPD who are mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure is high (37 to 64 percent). Factors that portend a poor prognosis in this population include failure to respond to noninvasive ventilation, the presence of multiorgan failure and the presence of virulent pathogens such as <em>Pseudomonas</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> species cultured from airway secretions.
