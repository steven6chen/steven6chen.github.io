In at least 25 percent of patients, the tumor is discovered incidentally during computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen for unrelated symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Studies have found that 19 of 33 patients (58 percent) and 40 of 57 patients (70 percent) with adrenal pheochromocytoma had their tumors discovered incidentally on imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In other patients, the tumor is found only at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among patients suspected to have a pheochromocytoma, the diagnosis is rarely confirmed. In one series, as an example, the diagnosis was established in only 1 of 300 patients evaluated for pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The treatment of pheochromocytoma will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81154\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81154 \">algorithm 1</a>).

It is an irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific alpha-adrenergic blocking agent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial dose is 10 mg once or twice daily, and the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg in divided doses every two to three days as needed to control blood pressure and spells. In general, the patient is ready for surgery in 10 to 14 days after initiation of alpha-adrenergic blockade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The final dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenoxybenzamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenoxybenzamine</a> is typically between 20 and 100 mg daily.

Men should be counseled about retrograde ejaculation, as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With their more favorable side-effect profiles and lower financial cost, selective alpha-1-adrenergic blocking agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terazosin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a>) are utilized in many centers or are preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenoxybenzamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenoxybenzamine</a> when long-term pharmacologic treatment is indicated (eg, for metastatic pheochromocytoma).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192460828\"><span class=\"h4\">Blood pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure should be monitored twice daily in the outpatient setting with the patient in the seated and standing positions.

This degree of volume expansion may be contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta-adrenergic blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated, which typically occurs two to three days preoperatively. The beta-adrenergic blocker should <strong>never</strong> be started first, because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a further elevation in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The clinician should exercise caution if the patient is asthmatic or has congestive heart failure. Chronic catecholamine excess can produce a cardiomyopathy that may become evident with the initiation of beta-adrenergic blockade, resulting in acute pulmonary edema. Therefore, when the beta-adrenergic blocker is administered, it should be used cautiously and at a low dose.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, a patient is usually given 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> orally every six hours on the first day of beta-adrenergic blockade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the second day, the beta-adrenergic blockade (assuming the patient tolerates the drug) is converted to a single, long-acting dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose is then increased as necessary to control the tachycardia (goal heart rate is 60 to 80 beats per minute).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although perioperative alpha-adrenergic blockade is widely recommended, a second regimen that has been utilized involves the administration of a calcium channel blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nicardipine</a> is the most commonly used calcium channel blocker in this setting; the starting dose is 30 mg twice daily of the sustained-release preparation. It is given orally to control blood pressure preoperatively and is given as an intravenous infusion intraoperatively. Although there is less collective experience with calcium channel blockers than with alpha and beta-adrenergic blockade, when calcium channel blockers are used as the primary mode of antihypertensive therapy, they may be as effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Clearly, the exclusive use of calcium channel blockers for the perioperative management of patients with catecholamine-secreting tumors does not prevent all hemodynamic changes; however, its use has been associated with low morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The main role for this class of drugs may be either to supplement the combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade protocol when blood pressure control is inadequate or to replace the adrenergic blockade protocol in patients with intolerable side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Metyrosine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another approach involves the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrosine</a> (alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis. In one report, the patients given metyrosine had a smoother perioperative course than those given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenoxybenzamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenoxybenzamine</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metyrosine</a> should be used with caution and only when other agents have been ineffective or in patients where tumor manipulation or destruction (eg, radiofrequency ablation of metastatic sites) will be marked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although some centers advocate that this agent should be used routinely preoperatively, most reserve it primarily for patients who cannot be treated with the typical combined alpha and beta-adrenergic blockade protocol because of intolerance or cardiopulmonary reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The protocol used at the Mayo Clinic with short-term preprocedure preparation is to start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrosine</a> 250 mg every six hours on day 1, 500 mg every six hours on day 2, 750 mg every six hours on day 3, and 1000 mg every six hours on the day before the procedure, with the last dose (1000 mg) the morning of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. With this short-course metyrosine therapy, the main side effect is hypersomnolence.</p><p>The side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrosine</a> can be disabling and with long-term therapy they include sedation, depression, diarrhea, anxiety, nightmares, crystalluria and urolithiasis, galactorrhea, and extrapyramidal signs. Metyrosine may be added to alpha and beta-adrenergic blockade when the resection will be difficult (eg, malignant paraganglioma) or if destructive therapy is planned (eg, radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastases or cryoablation of bone metastases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The extrapyramidal effects of phenothiazines or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> may be potentiated, and their use concomitantly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrosine</a> should be avoided. High fluid intake to avoid crystalluria is suggested for any patient taking more than 2 g daily. The metyrosine-phenoxybenzamine regimen has not been compared with the phenoxybenzamine-beta-adrenergic blocker regimen. The cost of metyrosine has increased dramatically recently and may make use of this medication prohibitive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ADRENALECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laparoscopic approach to the adrenal gland is the procedure of choice for patients with solitary intraadrenal pheochromocytomas that have no malignant radiologic features. Both the laparoscopic transabdominal and retroperitoneal approaches have been used successfully, although there is some evidence that the retroperitoneal approach is preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Key to success is an endocrine surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic techniques and operating on pheochromocytomas. Inexperience can lead to critical errors in management; for example, intraoperative tumor capsule rupture with seeding of the retroperitoneum and creating an incurable situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be safely performed for pheochromocytoma in more than 90 percent of cases. As an example, in an observational study of 102 patients with pheochromocytoma, 97 adrenalectomies were performed laparoscopically, seven were performed with open surgery, and four required conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>If the pheochromocytoma is in the adrenal gland, the entire gland should be removed in sporadic cases. Abdominal paragangliomas can also be approached laparoscopically in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no curative treatments for metastatic pheochromocytoma, unless the sites of disease are surgically resectable.

Patients with familial pheochromocytomas (eg, MEN2, VHL) have a high incidence of bilateral disease. Cortical-sparing bilateral adrenalectomy (partial adrenalectomy) may be considered for some patients with bilateral pheochromocytomas to prevent permanent glucocorticoid deficiency because some types of familial pheochromocytomas have less metastatic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. In a retrospective series of 96 patients with hereditary pheochromocytomas, 39 underwent an intended cortical-sparing procedure as part of a bilateral adrenalectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Acute adrenal insufficiency developed in only one patient, but two patients had a recurrence in their adrenal remnant requiring subsequent complete bilateral adrenalectomy.</p><p>The management of patients with MEN2 and VHL differs as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with <strong>MEN2</strong> have bilateral disease in 30 percent of cases and contralateral disease develops in 50 percent of the MEN2 patients with unilateral disease within 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/28,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,37,38</a>]. For these reasons, when bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas &gt;2 cm in diameter are present, consideration of <strong>complete</strong> bilateral adrenalectomy is recommended for MEN2 patients. If <strong>partial </strong>adrenalectomies are performed for bilateral pheochromocytoma in the setting of MEN2, the patient should be informed about the risk of recurrent disease (3 percent in the remnant gland occurring 6 to 13 years after partial adrenalectomy) and need for annual long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients with MEN2 have a high incidence of paroxysmal attacks and a higher prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular problems than do patients with VHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/28,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with some forms of <strong>VHL</strong> have less diffuse medullary disease, and cortical-sparing bilateral adrenalectomy is an option for these patients when bilateral disease is evident on imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, partial adrenalectomy potentially leaves residual adrenal medullary tissue behind, thus increasing the risk of recurrent pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one study, as an example, 13 of 14 patients with VHL did not require glucocorticoid therapy during a mean of 11 years of follow-up; however, three patients had recurrent pheochromocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similarly, in a study of 36 partial adrenalectomies in 26 patients with VHL, three patients became steroid dependent (11 percent), and there were five local recurrences (11 percent) with nine years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some variant forms of VHL (VHL type 2A) have high malignancy rates, and cortical-sparing adrenalectomy should be avoided in patients from these kindreds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

As an example, in a series of 143 patients who had open surgery, adverse perioperative events or complications occurred in 32 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The most common adverse event was sustained hypertension in 36 patients (25 percent). There were no perioperative deaths, myocardial infarctions, or cerebrovascular events. Perioperative factors associated with adverse perioperative events included larger tumor size, prolonged duration of anesthesia, and increased levels of preoperative urinary catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites.

The diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma is based on documentation of metastatic disease. The risk of malignancy is higher for paragangliomas than for pheochromocytomas, especially if the patient has a mutation in succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, and is also higher in some forms of variant VHL.

Metastatic disease was diagnosed at a median age of 39 years (range 7 to 83 years), with synchronous metastases in 96 (35 percent) patients. In 176 (65 percent) of patients, metastases developed at a median of 5.5 years (range 0.3 to 53.4 years) from the initial diagnosis. Median overall and disease-specific survivals were 24.6 and 33.7 years, respectively. Shorter survival correlated with male sex, older age at the time of primary tumor, synchronous metastases, larger primary tumor size, elevated dopamine, and not undergoing primary tumor resection. An individualized approach to patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is warranted. The only reliable clue to the presence of a malignant pheochromocytoma is local invasion or distant metastases, which may occur as long as 20 years after resection.

For beta-adrenergic blockade, we suggest cautious, low-dose administration. As an example, a patient is usually given 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> every six hours to start. On the second day of treatment, the beta-adrenergic blockade (assuming the patient tolerates the drug) is converted to a single, long-acting dose. The dose is then increased as necessary to control the tachycardia (goal heart rate is 60 to 80 beats per minute).
