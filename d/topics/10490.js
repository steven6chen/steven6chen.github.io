An APR is primarily used to resect a very low rectal cancer or anal cancer. It also is a salvage treatment for recurrent rectal or anal cancer and is a surgical treatment for severe inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>The most frequent complications of a perineal resection include hemorrhage, perineal wound complications, persistent perineal sinus, and perineal hernia. Factors associated with an increased risk of perineal complications include intraoperative hemorrhage, intraoperative gross contamination, operative perineal wound management, preoperative radiation therapy, and indications for surgery (malignant versus benign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Management of the perineal wound ranges from packing to partial closure, primary closure, and closure with continuous irrigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Primary closure of the perineum following an APR is widely accepted when intraoperative hemostasis is intact and no gross contamination has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>The perineal complications following an APR are reviewed here. Anastomotic and intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications are discussed elsewhere.

The perineum is bounded anteriorly by the pubic symphysis and the arcuate ligament, posteriorly by the coccyx, anterolaterally by the ischiopubic rami and the ischial tuberosities, and posterolaterally by the sacrotuberous ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54523\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54523 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63229 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62230\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62230 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74060\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74060 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79236 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52520\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52520 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492656\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMORRHAGE AND HEMATOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meticulous hemostasis during the perineal portion of the dissection is essential for reducing the risk of postoperative hemorrhage. The incidence of early and delayed postoperative perineal hemorrhage ranges from 0 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Perineal bleeding can develop from several sources, including the presacral venous plexus, the prostate in men or vagina in women, the pelvic floor musculature, or distal branches of the internal iliac vessels. Life-threatening postoperative hemorrhage is related to lack of intraoperative control of hemostasis. Hematomas occur as fluid accumulates in an undrained or inadequately drained space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47741652\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent and uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding is the typical cause of early, life-threatening postoperative perineal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Packing of the perineal wound is a maneuver used to control severe intraoperative pelvic and presacral hemorrhage. Early postoperative hemorrhage occurs with the first dressing change if the packing only temporarily tamponaded the bleeding vessels, or if a hemostatic thrombus is dislodged while the dressing is removed. Delayed bleeding is caused by erosion of the packing into previously sealed blood vessels and often becomes evident when the packing is removed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery#H98515550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Presacral bleeding'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493527\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of perineal bleeding depends upon the source and severity of blood loss. For severe bleeding, such as bleeding from presacral or pelvic vessels, repacking serves as a temporizing measure until the patient is stabilized and transferred to the operating room where the bleeding source can be identified and adequately controlled. Management of presacral bleeding and other pelvic sources of bleeding are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intra-abdominal-pelvic-and-genitourinary-complications-of-colorectal-surgery#H98515550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intra-abdominal, pelvic, and genitourinary complications of colorectal surgery&quot;, section on 'Presacral bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>For bleeding sites directly involving the perineal tissues, bleeding can be controlled with direct suture ligature of bleeding points, spray electrocautery, or application of topical hemostatic agents. Most minor venous bleeding can be controlled with temporary perineal packing, which usually stops the bleeding within 48 to 72 hours. Operative intervention is rarely required to localize and control the site of minor bleeding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493535\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no high-quality data from randomized trials to determine the optimal treatment for perineal bleeding or to assess the outcomes of postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma formation. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that perineal hemorrhage and hematoma predisposes patients to the development of subsequent perineal wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492663\"><span class=\"h1\">PERINEAL WOUND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of perineal wound complications following an APR ranges from 14 to 80 percent and includes surgical site infection, abscess, dehiscence, and delayed healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following findings were noted in a retrospective review of 153 patients undergoing an APR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major perineal wound complication (&gt;2 cm dehiscence, perineal abscess, or any wound requiring reoperation or readmission) occurred in 14 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minor perineal wound complication (&lt;2 cm dehiscence, stitch abscess, or sinus tracts) occurred in 24 percent. Patients with a major wound complication were excluded from the analysis for minor wounds.</p><p/><p>The incidence of perineal wound infection with subsequent delayed healing ranged from 11 to 50 percent in different series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of infection. Following resection of the pelvic contents (eg, rectum, mesentery) and perineum (eg, pelvic floor musculature, anus), a large cavity is created that is partially surrounded by the pelvic bone. Serous fluid and blood accumulate in this space, which can serve as a reservoir for bacterial colonization and can contribute to wound infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> formation of a chronic perineal sinus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493543\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for perineal wound complications can be classified according to the following subgroups: patient characteristics, indications for surgery, preoperative radiation treatment, and intraoperative findings and technical approach. The following are associated with an increased risk of perineal wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/1,4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient characteristics</strong> &ndash; Patient-related risk factors include diabetes, obesity, tobacco smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/2,3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,18</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective review of 120 rectal cancer patients undergoing an APR, significantly higher rates of perineal complications occurred in obese patients (odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25) and patients with diabetes (odds ratio 8.75, CI 1.69-45.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications for surgery</strong> &ndash; Indications for an APR include anal (includes anal canal, anal margin, or perianal skin) and rectal cancers and inflammatory bowel disease. A perineal resection performed for anal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease is associated with a higher risk of wound complications than one performed for rectal cancer. The following findings were noted in the above retrospective review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a diagnosis of anal cancer had a significantly higher rate of major complications compared with patients with rectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease (8 of 16 versus 12 of 120 and 1 of 12 patients, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with anal cancer and patients with inflammatory bowel disease had higher rates of minor wound complications compared with patients with rectal cancer (4 of 8 versus 5 of 11 versus 23 of 108 patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preoperative radiation treatment </strong>&ndash; Preoperative radiation treatments (RT) to the rectum and pararectal tissues may be associated with a significant increase in perineal wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>].

Compared with APR alone, APR following pelvic RT was associated with greater than two times the risk of perineal wound complications (odds ratio 2.22, 95% CI 1.45-3.40). The increase in risk was similar whether the conventional or extralevator technique of APR was used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intraoperative findings and technical approach </strong>&ndash; Intraoperative fecal contamination, hypothermia, rectal injury during dissection, and prolonged operating times have been associated with an increased risk of perineal wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Closure of the pelvic peritoneum is associated with a fixed fibrotic cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and a prolonged time (&gt;6 months) for perineal wound healing after primary closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Failure to close the perineum, however, can be associated with an increased risk of formation of a chronic perineal sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The technique of &quot;extralevator&quot; or &quot;cylindrical&quot; APR, typically utilized for patients with rectal cancer, has been associated with an increased risk of perineal wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The rigidity of the surrounding pelvic structures and the limited tissue for primary reapproximation of the perineal wound can create tension on the closure and lead to dehiscence and other perineal wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-perineal-complications-following-an-abdominal-perineal-resection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the setting of inadequate hemostasis or gross contamination, primary closure with drainage is associated with expedited healing but increased morbidity.

Careful examination of the perineal area is essential to confirming the diagnosis, with bacterial swabs to identify a possible secondary infection and biopsy of the tract to diagnose malignant transformation or a local recurrence. The sinus tract should be evaluated with imaging to define the anatomy and rule out causes of non-healing such as an enteroperineal fistula, undrained sepsis, retained rectal mucosa, or retained foreign body. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis is routinely performed as our initial study, with sinography, small bowel series, and computed tomographic (CT) enterography used as adjuncts, depending on the index of suspicion of an enteroperineal fistula.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493580\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the risk factors for development of a persistent perineal sinus following an APR mirror risk factors for other perineal wound complications (see <a href=\"#H492663\" class=\"local\">'Perineal wound complications'</a> above).

The most frequent complications include hemorrhage, perineal wound complications, pelvic sepsis, persistent perineal sinus, and perineal hernia. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meticulous hemostasis must be achieved when performing an APR, particularly with respect to the presacral vessels, to reduce the risk of early postoperative hemorrhage. For severe bleeding, such as bleeding from presacral or pelvic vessels, repacking serves as a temporizing measure. For bleeding sites directly involving the perineal tissues, bleeding can be controlled with direct suture ligature of bleeding points, spray electrocautery, or application of topical hemostatic agents. (See <a href=\"#H492656\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhage and hematomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The technical principles that reduce perineal wound complications include avoidance of fecal contamination, meticulous hemostasis, primary closure of the perineal wound in several layers, and closed-suction drainage of the pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H392080646\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with draining wounds in the absence of overt pelvic sepsis (eg, fever, pain), management includes local wound opening and drainage, debridement of ischemic tissues, removal of foreign bodies, and packing with wet-to-dry dressings or the application of a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device. (See <a href=\"#H492663\" class=\"local\">'Perineal wound complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a pelvic abscess, management includes hospital admission and image-guided percutaneous drainage, and administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H492663\" class=\"local\">'Perineal wound complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent perineal sinuses will rarely heal with conservative management alone. Optimal management includes an initial trial of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device, with operative repair reserved for those who fail to heal. (See <a href=\"#H492670\" class=\"local\">'Persistent perineal sinus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A perineal hernia is a rare complication following an APR. In the acute setting with evisceration of the abdominal contents, management includes immediate operative reduction and packing. (See <a href=\"#H492677\" class=\"local\">'Perineal hernia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the elective setting for patients with a symptomatic perineal hernia (eg, pain or discomfort), the perineal hernia can be repaired using the combined abdominal and perineal approach and placement of a prosthetic or biologic mesh or myocutaneous flap to reconstruct the pelvic floor.
