The infection can cause diarrhea, nausea, and stomach ache. It is very common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412659\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Giardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giardia infections do not always cause symptoms. Some people carry the parasite that causes Giardia without ever knowing it. When symptoms do happen, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that comes on suddenly and that can start off watery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling ill</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having bowel movements that are fatty and smell worse than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly cramps, gas, and bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412666\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. See your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe diarrhea, meaning it happens many times in a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot eat or drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p/><p>Young children and older adults with symptoms should make sure to see their doctor or nurse. That's because these groups can get dehydrated more easily than other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412673\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I catch Giardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giardia infections can spread in 3 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From person to person &ndash; The parasite that causes Giardia lives in bowel movements of people who are infected. You can catch Giardia from another person if they do not wash their hands after a bowel movement and then touch you. The same is true for someone who changes a diaper on a child or an adult and then does not wash his or her hands. It is also possible to catch Giardia through any kind of anal sex (even if you use a condom).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through food &ndash; The parasite that causes Giardia can live on food. Cooking kills it. But if food is not cooked or not handled the right way, it can carry Giardia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through water &ndash; The parasite that causes Giardia can live in water sources that people drink from. For instance, Giardia can live in streams or drinking wells. People who camp and hike are at risk of getting Giardia if they drink water from lakes or streams without treating the water properly first.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412680\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Giardia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have Giardia, he or she will ask you for a bowel movement sample. At the lab, the sample can be checked for Giardia and other infections that can cause the same symptoms as Giardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412687\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Giardia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for Giardia involves taking an antibiotic medicine for several days. In most cases, that gets rid of the infection and its symptoms. In some cases, though, Giardia does not get better with the first round of antibiotics. If that happens, doctors usually suggest changing the type or dose of antibiotic, or increasing the length of time a person is treated.</p><p>If you do not have symptoms of Giardia, you might not need antibiotics &ndash; even if your test shows you have the infection. Some people with Giardia can beat the infection without treatment. But children in daycare and people who work with food should be treated for Giardia, even if they have no symptoms. This helps prevent the spread of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412694\"><span class=\"h1\">Can Giardia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, it can. The most important thing is to be clean. Follow these tips:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, and teach children to do the same</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water after changing diapers or after touching anyone who can't control his or her bowels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw away dirty diapers right away in sealed trash bins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash clothes that could have even small amounts of bowel movement on them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to swallow water when swimming</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kill the germs and parasites in your drinking water when traveling or hiking. You can do this by doing one of these things:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Boiling drinking water for at least 10 minutes at a hard boil</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adding 5 drops of tincture of iodine to 4 cups of water and waiting 30 minutes. Tincture of iodine is a liquid you can buy at most pharmacies or camping goods stores. People also use it on cuts to kill germs. It is much better at killing Giardia than bleach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using a good water filtering system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28412806\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Giardia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
