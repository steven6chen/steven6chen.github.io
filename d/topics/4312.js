To make a colostomy, your doctor will do a procedure to make a small opening in your belly. Then he or she will connect your large intestine to this opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57774 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>A colostomy is sometimes called a &quot;stoma,&quot; which is a medical word that means &quot;opening.&quot; After a colostomy is made, your bowel movements will come out through the stoma into a bag that is attached to your skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84445896\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my bowel movements be like with a colostomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will probably have about 4 to 8 bowel movements a day. Your bowel movements might be looser than they used to be (not as solid).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84445911\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I manage my colostomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A special nurse (called an ostomy nurse) will teach you how to manage your colostomy. He or she will teach you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When and how to empty the bag that collects your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When and how to put on a new bag to collect your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to check your stoma for problems</p><p/><p>There are different types of colostomy bags that people can use. With some types of bags, you empty, clean, and reuse them. With other types, you throw them out after each use.</p><p>Some people worry that their bag will leak, or that other people will be able to smell their bowel movements. But this is not common. The bags are made so that they do not leak or smell.</p><p>If you have a certain type of colostomy, you might be able to manage it with a process called &quot;irrigation.&quot; This is a way to make your bowel movements regular. It involves squirting water into your stoma on a regular basis to cause a bowel movement to happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84445926\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen with a colostomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different problems can happen with a colostomy, either right away or years later. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any of the following symptoms or problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your stoma is swollen or larger than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your stoma is smaller than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your stoma leaks more than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a rash or sores around your stoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have sudden belly pain, cramps, or nausea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are dehydrated. Dehydration is when the body loses too much water. Symptoms of dehydration include not making as much urine or having dark yellow urine, or feeling thirsty, tired, dizzy, or confused.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You haven't had any gas or bowel movements for 4 to 6 hours (during the day). These symptoms could mean that your stoma is blocked.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84445941\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to follow a special diet?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. But you should avoid getting constipated. (Constipation means trouble having bowel movements.) To avoid constipation, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods that have a lot of fiber (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of water and other fluids</p><p/><p>The foods you eat can affect the odor of your bowel movements, and how solid or loose they are. Certain foods can also make you have more gas. The foods that can affect your bowel movements and gas are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58115 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84445996\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like with a colostomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should be able to live an active and normal life with your colostomy. But many people worry about the following things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clothes &ndash; You do not need to wear special clothes. Other people won't be able to see your bag under your clothes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baths and showers &ndash; You can take a bath or shower with or without your bag on.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sports &ndash; You will probably be able to play most sports. You might want to wear a special belt to protect your bag and keep it in place. Doctors usually recommend that people with a colostomy not play certain contact sports (such as football) or lift weights.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swimming &ndash; You can swim with your bag on. Make sure to empty your bag before you swim.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex &ndash; You can have sex. But you might want to wear a special wrap to protect (and hide) your bag during sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel &ndash; When you travel, be sure to bring extra supplies to manage your colostomy. If you fly, take your supplies in your carry-on luggage.</p><p/><p>It is normal to feel sad, upset, or worried when you have a colostomy. If you have these feelings, try to get help. You can talk with a family member, friend, or counselor. You might also find it helpful to go to a support group for people who have a colostomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26018299\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colectomy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Crohn disease in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gas-and-bloating-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gas and bloating (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ileostomy-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ileostomy care (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
