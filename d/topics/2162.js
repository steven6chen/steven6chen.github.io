Although a higher percentage of men have localized disease at presentation, metastatic prostate cancer remains an important clinical problem in terms of the number of men with advanced disease and its impact on quality of life, and as a cause of mortality.</p><p>Osteoblastic lesions in bone are the most common site of metastasis. These frequently are symptomatic and can cause pain, debility, and functional impairment. The treatment of bone metastases in men with prostate cancer is palliative. The goals of treatment are to improve survival, relieve pain, improve mobility, and prevent complications (eg, pathologic fractures, epidural spinal cord compression).</p><p>The management of bone metastases in men with advanced prostate cancer is reviewed here. Treatment can include treatments directed specifically against the cancer-involving bone, osteoclast inhibition to prevent complications from osseous involvement, and systemic therapy directed against the cancer.</p><p>The clinical presentation and evaluation of bone metastases and the overall approach to the management of men with advanced prostate cancer are discussed separately.
