The clinical manifestations of this group of diseases, called autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), depend greatly on the type of antibody that is produced by the abnormal immune reaction.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the mechanisms underlying AIHA due to warm agglutinins and drugs. The diagnosis and treatment of this disorder and issues related to cold agglutinins and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria are discussed separately.

For this reason, they are called &quot;<strong>warm</strong> agglutinins&quot; even though they seldom directly agglutinate the RBCs. Rarely, IgM antibodies have these reaction characteristics and readily agglutinate red cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM antibodies which generally react with polysaccharide antigens on the RBC surface only at temperatures below that of the core temperature of the body. They are therefore called &quot;<strong>cold</strong> agglutinins.&quot; Rarely, IgG antibodies have these reaction characteristics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies of the IgA isotype are much less common and often of unknown significance. They can produce AIHA with either of the above reaction characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody detection: the direct Coombs test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of warm agglutinin AIHA is based upon detection of antibody on the surface of the RBC, or of the consequences of its interaction with the red cell.</p><p>The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are usually diagnosed by demonstrating an abnormality in a single clinical laboratory test, the direct antiglobulin test first described by Coombs and therefore sometimes called the direct Coombs test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this test, the RBCs of the patient are washed free of adherent proteins and reacted with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies prepared against the various immunoglobulins, particularly IgG and a fragment of the third component of complement, C3d. If either or both of these are present on the red cell surface, agglutination or some other endpoint will be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F100639\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100639 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>When these tests are accurately and specifically performed, over 99 percent of patients with warm agglutinin AIHA will exhibit a positive result compared with less than 1 percent of the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is important to know whether IgG or C3 or both are present on the red cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69817 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If IgG is present, then the destruction of the red cells is almost certainly due to this antibody. If C3 is also deposited on the RBCs, then the IgG antibody was able to fix complement and complement may play an additional role in the destruction of the cells. If C3 is not present, then the IgG antibody is not able to fix complement or, as with antibodies directed against the Rh complex, the antigens are too far apart for two IgG molecules to be able to activate complement (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antigens on proteins of the Rh complex'</a> below). In these settings, complement plays no role in the destruction of the cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of C3 but not IgG can be explained by one of two mechanisms: First, the antibody is not IgG; this is the case for IgM cold agglutinins and the rare IgA antibodies. Second, the antibody is IgG but so poorly fixed to the RBC surface that it is removed as the cells are washed in preparation for the test. This reduction in affinity may be temperature-related.</p><p/><p>As an example, the Donath-Landsteiner antibody in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria and the antibody of cold agglutinin disease both show better fixation to the RBC surface at lower temperature. In other cases, the antibody (with or without its inciting antigen) may be so poorly fixed under any condition that it is washed away during the preparation of the red cells for the test; this is frequently the case when the antigen is a drug (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal subjects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of a positive Coombs test in normal blood donors is in the range of 1:1000 to 1:36,000, and is higher in older donors than in younger ones. A number of risk factors have been associated with a positive test, including cardiolipin antibodies, AIDS, drugs, and elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgG) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>A positive Coombs test may predate the clinical detection of malignancy, especially a lymphoproliferative disorder, by months to years. This was shown in a follow-up study of 586 Coombs positive blood donors and 2344 age- and sex-matched Coombs negative donor controls, in which a significantly increased incidence of all cancers (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.13-4.10) and hematologic cancers (RR 8.3; 95% CI 1.5-43) was noted in the Coombs positive donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF RBC DESTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the destruction of red cells is due to immunologic mechanisms which are dependent upon the type of immunoproteins affixed to the red cells. Two fundamental processes are involved, immunoadherence and direct lysis by complement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoadherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoadherence is the process by which a target cell (in this case, a red cell) is affixed to a destructive cell of the immune system (phagocyte or other cytotoxic cell) through an immunoprotein molecule reacting with molecules on each cell. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a mechanism of red blood cell (RBC) destruction, which is based on the interaction with IgG-FcR of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells.</p><p>An IgG molecule may be bound to an antigen on the red cell and an Fc receptor on the cytotoxic cell. Three closely related types of receptors (FcRI, FcRII, and FcRIII) are distributed on monocytes, granulocytes, cytotoxic lymphocytes, platelets, and other cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These receptors bind to areas on the Fc portion of the IgG molecule with variable affinity, depending upon the identity of the receptor and of the isotypic subtype of the IgG molecule. In general, IgG3 and IgG1 antibodies bind best, but even they have a rather low affinity for the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>If complement is fixed by the antibody, the third and fourth components of complement bind covalently to various components on the red cell membrane; they may bind to one or more of four complement receptors (CR) found on cytotoxic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. CR1 and CR2 belong to the class of molecules containing short consensus repeats characteristic of many complement reactive proteins, while CR3 and CR4 belong to the bimolecular integrin type of surface proteins.</p><p>Immunoadherence, especially that mediated by IgG-FcR, may stimulate the set of reactions that result in phagocytosis. In order for phagocytosis to occur, a &quot;sufficiency&quot; of IgG-FcR reactions must occur in a patch of the membrane of the phagocytic cell; this usually means that the reaction has been fostered by a prolonged time of interaction, as occurs during the slow circulation of RBCs through the spleen.</p><p>The reactions of C3 and C4 with their receptors have a higher affinity but are less likely to result in phagocytosis by themselves. They can, however, augment the phagocytosis engendered by IgG-FcR reactions by holding the RBC in place at the cytotoxic cell until the requisite number of IgG-FcR reactions can occur.</p><p>The phagocytosis that results from immunoadherence may completely engulf the target red cell, destroying it in an internal phagosome. Commonly, however, the ingestion is partial, resulting in a RBC with a reduced surface-to-volume ratio that becomes a spherocyte (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70611\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Spherocytes, by virtue of their reduced deformability, are not able to traverse the small slits in the wall of the splenic sinuses and are therefore destroyed in the cords of Billroth of the spleen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Monocyte adherence tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of IgG antibody on the target red cell induces adherence to monocytes. This property has been used to detect the antibody and assess its clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These tests are not widely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct destruction by complement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement is a group of proteins that interact on the surface of the target cell; the cytotoxic end product is the membrane attack complex C5b-9. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.) The reactions are regulated by both serum and membrane-bound proteins so that the process is markedly inefficient. Many sequences must be initiated in order to get enough complement fixed to the RBC surface in order to lyse the cell. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulators and receptors of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IgM antibodies are much more efficient at initiating the fixation of complement sequences, since only one molecule of antibody is needed. IgG antibodies, on the other hand, require two molecules in order to initiate this process. Thus, direct lysis of RBC by complement is a less common mechanism for autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to IgG antibodies. The IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses are not capable of activating the complement cascade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57721417\"><span class=\"h2\">RBC membrane changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with antibodies to the Pr component of glycoproteins there is often a discrepancy between the evidence of immunological attack and the degree of hemolysis, which can sometimes be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This may be due to the hemolysis of the red cells because of physical changes in the membrane that occur when the antibody is affixed to the cell, resulting in abnormal cation permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">WARM AGGLUTININ DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is that due to IgG antibody able to react with its antigen at core body temperature, the so-called &quot;warm agglutinins.&quot; These account for more than 80 percent of all cases of AIHA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics of the antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warm antibodies are always polyclonal, even when they occur in diseases characterized by monoclonal accumulation or proliferation of lymphocytes. The distribution of subtypes varies from patient to patient and does not necessarily reflect the distribution of subtypes in the IgG in the plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The subisotypes are one of the characteristics that determine the rate of destruction; IgG3 and IgG1 antibodies are the more destructive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] due perhaps to their greater ability to fix complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A retrospective review found a high prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy in adults with warm AIHA (30.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The reasons for this association are unknown.</p><p>The antibodies in AIHA appear to react only to protein structures on the RBC surface (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics of the antigens'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. These antibodies probably persist because of continued antigenic stimulation from the autoantigens. Protein antigens are nearly always processed into the T-cell memory system. Thus, after the primary immunization, subsequent antibody production (as in an anamnestic antibody response), is derived from cells that have undergone the second Ig rearrangement to result in IgG antibodies. In cases in which the antigen is not continuously available (eg, certain forms of drug-related immune hemolytic anemia), antibody production will stop fairly abruptly, but is readily reinitiated when the antigen (drug) is reintroduced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Genesis of antibody production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear why autoantibody production should begin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. IgM antibodies to autoantigens are normally present in the plasma, although at low and nonpathologic levels. It has been suggested that the B-cell clones that normally produce these autoantibodies are altered or de-repressed to produce IgG antibodies in high and pathogenetic titer in AIHA. Alternatively, defective control of IgG autoreactivity by autologous IgM has been proposed as an underlying mechanism for autoimmune hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Alteration of T-cell function may play a role in the genesis of autoantibodies, since induction of apoptosis appears to normally regulate deletion of autoreactive T cells clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Reduced Th1- and increased Th2-like responses have been associated with AIHA, with the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in the treatment of AIHA being attributed, at least in part, to a readjustment of this <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2</span> imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

In a study of 12 children with Evans' syndrome (ie, autoimmune destruction of at least two hematologic cell types), six had lymphocyte abnormalities suggestive of the presence of ALPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apoptosis-and-autoimmune-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Apoptosis and autoimmune disease&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>In some patients, autoantibody production is initiated or exacerbated by an immune reaction to a microbial infection (heteroimmune response). This is most likely to occur in children with viral infections, and results in the production of autoantibody beginning one to three weeks after the initial infection and lasting for one to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A reaction to blood transfusion or transplantation may also initiate this process (alloimmune response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>].

The complex is not able to move in a lateral plane of the membrane because it is attached to the cytoskeleton underlying the membrane surface. As mentioned above, two IgG molecules must be deposited to initiate complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].

Several weeks to months after starting the medication, the direct Coombs test becomes positive with anti-IgG but not with anti-C3. The antibody produced reacts with a component of the surface Rh complex in the absence of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Two syndromes result: one in which the drug is firmly bound to the membrane (penicillin type), and one in which the drug is only loosely bound to the membrane glycoprotein (fuadin type, previously called the &quot;innocent bystander&quot; type, but more reasonably called the immune complex type).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Penicillin type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When very large doses of penicillin (10,000,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day)</span> are given, some patients develop mild to moderate hemolysis with a direct Coombs test that is positive with anti-IgG antisera and usually negative with anti-C3 antisera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The indirect Coombs test, in which the patient's serum is incubated with normal red cells, is positive only if the normal red cells are pretreated with high concentrations of penicillin. These results are interpreted to mean that the drug binds to a protein of the Rh complex, accounting for the fact that the complement sequence is not initiated. When the drug is stopped, hemolysis usually ceases within a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune complex type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the immune complex type of reaction (also called nonpenicillin type, ternary complex type, or fuadin type), hemolysis usually begins within a few days to two weeks following the first ingestion of the drug. The onset of hemolysis may be quite sudden and severe, sometimes accompanied by hemoglobinuria and acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Once the drug is stopped, hemolysis diminishes rapidly, the rate depending upon the clearance of the drug.</p><p>The direct Coombs test in the immune complex type of drug-induced AIHA is usually positive with anti-C3 antisera but negative with anti-IgG antisera. The indirect antiglobulin test is positive only if the drug and a source of complement are added to the reaction mixture; under those conditions, the red cells have C3 on the surface but IgG is not detected. The antibody may also be detected by its ability to immunologically hemolyze the red cells; this hemolysis may be increased by using the red cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</p><p>For many years, it was thought that the drug did not react with the red cell and that the red cell was an &quot;innocent bystander&quot;. It is now thought that the reaction is a typical haptene reaction in which the drug forms a loose complex with a membrane glycoprotein (the Rh complex in many cases); the epitope is comprised of both components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia-warm-agglutinins-and-drugs/abstract/56,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,70,71</a>].
