In clean-contaminated procedures, the predominant organisms include gram-negative rods and enterococci in addition to skin flora. When the surgical procedure involves a viscus, the pathogens reflect the endogenous flora of the viscus or nearby mucosal surface; such infections are typically polymicrobial.</p><p>The causative pathogens associated with SSIs in the United States have changed over time. Between 1986 and 2003, the percentage of SSIs caused by gram-negative bacilli decreased from 56 to 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. <em>S. aureus</em> was the most common pathogen, causing 22 percent of SSIs during this time period. Between 2006 and 2007, the proportion of SSIs caused by <em>S. aureus</em> increased to 30 percent, with methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) comprising nearly half of these isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

This trend toward resistant organisms and <em>Candida</em> species probably is due to the widespread use of prophylactic and empiric antibiotics, increased severity of illness, and greater numbers of immunocompromised patients undergoing surgical procedures.</p><p>Exogenous sources of infection include contamination of the surgical site by organisms from the operating room environment or personnel. Anal, vaginal, or nasopharyngeal carriage of group A streptococci by operating room personnel has been implicated as a cause of several SSI outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Preoperative antibiotics are warranted if there is high risk of infection or if there is high risk of deleterious outcomes should infection develop at the surgical site (such as in the setting of immune compromise, cardiac surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> implantation of a foreign device). Antimicrobial therapy administered in the setting of contaminated wounds is not considered prophylactic; in such cases, a therapeutic course of antimicrobial therapy is warranted. Patients who receive prophylactic antibiotics within one to two hours before the initial incision have lower rates of SSI than patients who receive antibiotics sooner or later than this window (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79097 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

To achieve these goals, an antimicrobial agent should be active against the pathogens most likely to contaminate the surgical site, be administered in an appropriate dose and at an appropriate time to ensure adequate serum and tissue concentrations during the period of potential contamination, and be administered for the shortest effective period to minimize adverse effects, emergence of resistance, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic selection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3099970\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, antimicrobial selection for SSI prophylaxis is based on cost, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and antimicrobial activity.

For most adults, it is acceptable to dose antimicrobials based on standardized doses for safety, efficacy, and convenience. However, the serum and tissue concentrations of some drugs administered to obese patients may differ from those in nonobese patients for a number of reasons, including pharmacokinetic variability related to the lipophilicity of the administered drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>There are limited data for determining the optimal approach to antimicrobial dosing for obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

SSIs are often localized to the incision site but can also extend into deeper adjacent structures. Incisional SSIs may be superficial (ie, those involving only the skin or subcutaneous tissue) or deep (ie, those involving deep soft tissues of an incision). <span class=\"nowrap\">Organ/space</span> SSIs may involve any part of the anatomy (other than the incision) that was opened or manipulated during the operative procedure. (See <a href=\"#H3142347\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds may be classified as clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty. Clean wounds are uninfected operative wounds in which no viscus is entered, no purulence is encountered, and the wound is closed primarily. Clean-contaminated wounds are operative wounds in which a viscus is entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Contaminated wounds include open accidental wounds, wounds in which purulence was encountered during the procedure, wounds from operations with major breaks in sterile technique, or wounds from operations with gross viscus spillage. Dirty wounds are old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue, foreign bodies, or fecal contamination or wounds that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscus. (See <a href=\"#H3142409\" class=\"local\">'Wound classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominant organisms causing SSIs after clean procedures are skin flora, including streptococcal species, <em>S. aureus</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. In clean-contaminated procedures, the predominant organisms include gram-negative rods and enterococci in addition to skin flora. When the surgical procedure involves a viscus, the pathogens reflect the endogenous flora of the viscus or nearby mucosal surface; such infections are typically polymicrobial. (See <a href=\"#H3142798\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of antimicrobial prophylaxis is to prevent SSI by reducing the burden of microorganisms at the surgical site during the operative procedure. Preoperative antibiotics are warranted if there is high risk of infection or if there is high risk of deleterious outcomes should infection develop at the surgical site. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, antimicrobial selection for SSI prophylaxis is based on cost, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and antimicrobial activity. There is little evidence to suggest that broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents result in lower rates of postoperative SSI compared with narrower spectrum antimicrobial agents. The clinical approach is summarized in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76499 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87199 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87201 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87202 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87204 \">table 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87205 \">table 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87206 \">table 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63103 \">table 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89540 \">table 12</a>).

Some pharmacokinetic studies have noted that administration of 1 or 2 g of cefazolin may not be sufficient to produce serum and tissue concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most common pathogens. In addition, doubling the normal dose of cephalosporins may produce similar concentrations in obese patients to those achieved with standard doses in nonobese patients, with relatively low cost and favorable safety profile. Therefore, we favor administration of cefazolin 2 g for patients &lt;120 kg and cefazolin 3 g for patients &ge;120 kg (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

If the preferred agent is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or a fluoroquinolone, administration should begin 120 minutes before surgical incision because of the prolonged infusion times required for these drugs.

Redosing may also be warranted in the setting of factors that shorten antimicrobial half-life, such as extensive burns. The dosing interval should be measured from the time of the preoperative dose (not from the beginning of the procedure). Redosing may not be warranted for patients in whom the antimicrobial half-life is prolonged, such as renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H188863\" class=\"local\">'Repeat dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, repeat antimicrobial dosing following wound closure is not necessary and may increase antimicrobial resistance. For cases in which prophylaxis beyond the period of surgery is warranted, in general, the duration should be less than 24 hours.
