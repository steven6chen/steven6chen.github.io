Medical and surgical treatment of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) will be reviewed here. Similar principles apply to infections associated with other implanted orthopedic devices, such as pins and rods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Biofilms play an important role in the pathogenesis of PJIs. Organisms within biofilm become resistant to therapy; as a result, antimicrobial therapy is often unsuccessful unless the biofilm is physically disrupted or removed by surgical debridement. Biofilms also account for two other features of PJIs: the propensity of infection to become apparent weeks or months after surgery and the common observation that antimicrobial therapy results in a clinical response that is typically followed by a relapse within days or months if the infected prosthesis is retained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Biofilm'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and prevention of these infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-prosthetic-joint-and-other-types-of-orthopedic-hardware-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of prosthetic joint and other types of orthopedic hardware infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prosthetic joint infections are categorized according to the timing of symptom onset after implantation: early onset (&lt;3 months after surgery), delayed onset (from 3 to 12 months after surgery), and late onset (&gt;12 months after surgery). These infections have the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early-onset infections are usually acquired during implantation and are often due to virulent organisms, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic organisms, or mixed infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed-onset infections are also usually acquired during implantation. Consistent with the indolent presentation, delayed infections are usually caused by less virulent organisms, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci or enterococci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late-onset infections resulting from hematogenous seeding are typically acute and often due to <em>S. aureus</em>, beta hemolytic streptococci, or Enterobacteriaceae.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8190615\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) generally consists of both surgery and antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The surgical and antimicrobial approaches depend on the timing and microbiology of infection, stability of the prosthesis, quality of the soft tissue envelope, and individual patient circumstances. Surgical options include resection arthroplasty with reimplantation (in one or two stages), debridement and retention of prosthesis, resection arthroplasty in the absence of subsequent hardware reimplantation, or amputation. In the United States, two-stage replacement arthroplasty is the most common surgical approach for management of PJI.</p><p>The choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy for treatment of PJI must be tailored to surgical management as described in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15429516\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection arthroplasty with reimplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of delayed-onset and late-onset infections require prosthesis removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Options for replacement arthroplasty in patients with PJIs include one-stage or two-stage procedures. The two-stage procedure is associated with the highest success rates and is the preferred procedure in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]; the one-stage procedure is more commonly performed in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers are commonly used in between stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Data are insufficient to determine whether use of antibiotic-impregnated cement in temporary spacers confers additional benefit for treatment of PJI beyond the benefit associated with systemic antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Therefore, the optimal approach to their use is uncertain.</p><p>Cemented reimplants are frequently fixed using cement impregnated with antimicrobial agents; the efficacy of this approach is uncertain. Most commercially available antibiotic-impregnated cements are prepared with aminoglycosides, which are appropriate for infection due to gram-negative organisms. In the setting of documented infection due to gram-positive organisms, it may be appropriate to mix <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> with a commercial preparation containing an aminoglycoside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15429531\"><span class=\"h3\">Two stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A two-stage strategy is the most common surgical approach in the United States for management of PJI. This procedure consists of prosthesis resection, debridement of soft tissue and bone, and placement of a joint spacer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Following removal of the infected prosthesis, antimicrobials with activity against the infecting organism(s) are administered for four to six weeks for most pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reimplantation of a new prosthesis is undertaken following completion of antibiotic therapy.</p><p>The use of an antimicrobial-impregnated joint spacer for local delivery of antimicrobial therapy is a standard practice for two-stage surgery to manage PJI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An articulating or static (nonarticulating) spacer may be used. Use of an articulating spacer may permit earlier ambulation, while use of a static spacer may limit range of motion and lead to muscle atrophy and arthrofibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The choice of spacer type does not appear to influence infection-related outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Many experts favor an observation period of two or more weeks off all antimicrobials prior to reimplantation of a new prosthesis, with repeat culture to assess sterilization of the joint space; others favor proceeding directly with implantation of a new prosthesis following completion of antimicrobials if there are no clinical signs of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. A longer duration between stages to ascertain the lack of relapsing infection should be weighed against the potential risk of the development of joint arthrofibrosis and diminished functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The role of culture prior to reimplantation was evaluated in a prospective study including 69 patients with knee arthroplasty infection managed with two-stage replacement arthroplasty; half had joint replacement immediately after completing six weeks of antimicrobial therapy, while the other half had repeat culture four weeks after completion of antimicrobial therapy prior to joint replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Those with positive cultures underwent repeat debridement and a repeat course of antibiotic therapy prior to joint replacement; those with negative cultures underwent prompt joint replacement. The rate of recurrent infection was lower among the patients who underwent culture prior to reimplantation than those who did not (3 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, another study including 152 patients with PJI noted that the presence of positive cultures obtained at the time of new prosthesis implantation was not associated with a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A persistently elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) at the time of reimplantation surgery may or may not be accurate in predicting the presence of persistent PJI. In one study of 76 patients treated with two-stage exchange, ESR remained persistently elevated in 37 (54 percent), and CRP remained elevated in 14 (21 percent) patients, without any evidence of residual infection at the time of reimplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The need for subsequent debridement prior to reimplantation must be interpreted in the context of the entire clinical picture when deciding timing of reimplantation. Routine synovial fluid examination and joint aspirate cultures prior to reimplantation is not required but can be pursued in selected cases when there is clinical concern regarding the presence of persistent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The approach to systemic antimicrobial therapy following reimplantation of a new prosthesis is dependent on culture data obtained at the time of reimplantation as well as previous culture data obtained at the time of the original resection. It is reasonable to institute empiric antimicrobial therapy pending availability of culture data, which can be discontinued once cultures are finalized as negative. Patients with positive cultures at the time of reimplantation should be managed similarly to patients undergoing one-stage replacement arthroplasty. (See <a href=\"#H4163000\" class=\"local\">'One stage'</a> below.)</p><p>The microbiologic eradication rate for two-stage exchange arthroplasty is close to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/8,20,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20,23,24</a>], although most studies excluded patients who had a permanent resection arthroplasty without a second-stage reimplantation, usually due to persistent infection in the joint or periarticular tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/8,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4163000\"><span class=\"h3\">One stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A one-stage (direct exchange) procedure consists of prosthesis resection, debridement of the soft tissue and bone, and reimplantation of new prosthesis during the same surgery. This procedure is advocated in patients with total hip arthroplasty infection, good soft tissue envelope, and an easily treatable microorganism. In selected case series, the microbiologic eradication rate of this strategy approaches 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Given the lack of comparative effectiveness trials, it is difficult to recommend this procedure over the two-stage approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Based on published literature, a one-stage approach may be suitable in selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Initial therapy for treatment of <em>S. aureus</em> infection following one-stage replacement arthroplasty consists of four to six weeks of pathogen-specific intravenous therapy in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> (300 to 450 mg orally twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Surgical debridement followed by a long course of parenteral antibiotics is curative in up to 71 percent of early-onset infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute onset of symptoms (&lt;3 weeks of symptom onset) in the setting of a well-fixed prosthesis without a sinus tract.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients for whom alternative surgical strategies are not acceptable because of high risk may also be considered for a debridement and retention strategy; in such cases, the likelihood of relapsed infection is greater than for patients who undergo resection arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,37</a>].</p><p/><p>Debridement alone is not an effective management strategy for PJI if the prosthesis is loose or if a sinus tract is present; in such cases, resection arthroplasty is required. Debridement and retention of prosthesis can be done via either arthrotomy or arthroscopic lavage. Arthrotomy allows debridement of infected tissue and synovium as well as polyethylene liner exchange. Available data indicate that arthrotomy is associated with better outcomes than arthroscopic lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The optimal number of subsequent debridements is unclear; among patients with methicillin-resistant staphylococcal PJI in one study, the optimal number of debridements was two to three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Initial therapy for treatment of staphylococcal PJI managed with debridement and component retention consists of two to six weeks of pathogen-specific intravenous therapy in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> (300 to 450 mg orally twice daily or 600 mg once daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment/abstract/9,36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36,39</a>].

Subsequently, a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy is administered, after which a new prosthesis is implanted. Some favor proceeding directly with implantation of a new prosthesis following completion of antimicrobials if there are no clinical signs of infection, while others favor an observation period of two to eight weeks off of antimicrobials prior to implantation of a new prosthesis, with repeat culture to assess sterilization of the joint space.
