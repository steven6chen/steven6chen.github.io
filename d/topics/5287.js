Preemptive transplantation improves patient survival compared with transplantation after initiation of dialysis. However, dialysis is often required by patients who are awaiting transplantation or who receive a transplant that does not work immediately.</p><p>This topic review discusses the timing of renal transplantation and the optimal dialysis modality and prescription for patients who require dialysis either before or after transplantation.</p><p>Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-graft-failure-in-kidney-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for graft failure in kidney transplantation&quot;</a>).

The suitability of individuals for transplantation is discussed elsewhere.</p><p>Preemptive transplantation is generally preferred because it leads to substantial improvements in graft and patient survival when compared with transplantation after a period of dialysis therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of nearly 40,000 primary renal transplant recipients, those undergoing preemptive transplantation had 25 and 27 percent reductions in the relative risk for graft loss for deceased- and live-donor transplants, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Corresponding risks for patient death were reduced by 16 and 31 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 7948 patients identified from the Dutch National Organ Transplant Registry, the 10-year survival was greater among patients who underwent a preemptive living-donor kidney transplant compared with patients who had a deceased-donor transplantation after a median time of three years on dialysis (73 versus 45 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Compared with wait-listing on dialysis, the patient survival benefit with preemptive transplantation was approximately 7.5 to 9.9 years for 40-year-old patients and 4.3 to 6 years for 70-year-old patients.</p><p/><p>The amount of time that a patient spends on dialysis prior to transplantation is directly related to increased mortality, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H22706301\" class=\"local\">'Patients already on dialysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Improved graft and patient survival associated with preemptive transplantation may be related to decreased rates of delayed graft function and biopsy-confirmed acute rejection for both deceased-donor and living-donor transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6</a>]. In addition, relatively lower clearance provided by dialysis, compared with a transplanted kidney, may cause the accumulation of substances associated with atherosclerosis, malnutrition, and chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Despite its demonstrated benefit, only approximately 20 percent of living-donor and 5 percent of deceased-donor transplants are performed preemptively in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is primarily due to the rapid increase in the number of potential transplant candidates without a commensurate increase in the donor pool. As a result, the waiting time for a deceased-donor kidney has dramatically increased over the last 15 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613248152\"><span class=\"h3\">Exceptions to preemptive transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe nephrotic syndrome may benefit from dialysis prior to transplantation. This is because severely nephrotic patients are hypercoagulable. Hypercoagulable patients who undergo transplantation are more likely to thrombose the transplanted kidney if they undergo preemptive transplantation. By contrast, dialysis tends to decrease the thrombotic tendency associated with nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-vein-thrombosis-and-hypercoagulable-state-in-nephrotic-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal vein thrombosis and hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are receiving their second transplant after the first transplanted kidney has failed within one year may also benefit from a short period of dialysis before the second transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H63438504\" class=\"local\">'Timing of second transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63436591\"><span class=\"h2\">Glomerular filtration rate threshold for transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although we believe that transplantation should be performed in most patients prior to the need for dialysis, the precise level of kidney function (ie, glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) at which to perform a transplant is not known.</p><p>Experts generally agree that transplantation should not be performed until the estimated GFR (eGFR) is &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and evidence exists of a progressive and irreversible decrease in renal function over the previous 6 to 12 months. This is consistent with the consensus guidelines from the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We calculate the eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Performing a transplantation at a higher eGFR is not justified, even in the setting of irreversible renal disease. This is because patients generally have few signs or symptoms of ESRD that require dialysis at this level of kidney function, and there is no benefit to be gained by performing a transplantation before it is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This was best shown by an analysis of 19,461 first-time, preemptive kidney recipients reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) between 1995 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Analysis of this large cohort did not detect any difference in patient survival or death-censored graft survival among patients who were transplanted at eGFRs &lt;10, between 10 and 15, between 15 and 20, and &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p><p>Once the eGFR is below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the decision to perform an elective preemptive transplant should be based upon individual patient (and donor) preferences. Unlike the decision to initiate chronic dialysis, the transplant should not be delayed until the emergence of uremic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Referral for evaluation by a transplant team should take place before this eGFR is reached. We refer for transplant evaluation at an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The evaluation of a transplant candidate and the identification and evaluation of potential donors takes time. This earlier referral threshold allows appropriate candidates to be waitlisted at the time the eGFR declines to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> and increases the chances that the candidate will avoid dialysis prior to transplantation. This approach is in agreement with the National Kidney <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/Kidney</span> Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF/KDOQI)</span> guidelines, which recommend patient referral for transplant evaluation at an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The evaluations of potential transplant recipients and donors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-living-kidney-donor-candidate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the living kidney donor candidate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, referral at this level of kidney function is often not done for several reasons, since many nephrologists do not recognize the benefit provided by preemptive transplantation, and patients are often reluctant to consider any kind of renal replacement therapy until it is absolutely necessary. In addition, there is a lack of streamlined access to pretransplant evaluation in many regions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22706301\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients already on dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are already on dialysis and are suitable candidates for transplantation should be considered for transplantation as soon as possible. This is because the adverse effects of dialysis therapy on posttransplant outcomes are duration dependent. As noted above, transplantation is associated with better outcomes than dialysis for most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Analyses of the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) database have shown that pretransplant dialysis duration of six months or more decreases graft survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61627\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61627 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. In one study, dialysis duration for 36 months conferred a 68 percent increase in death-censored graft loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61627\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61627 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another analysis, the 10-year adjusted graft survival for both deceased- and living-donor transplants was higher for patients transplanted preemptively compared with those who were on dialysis for two years prior to transplantation (69 and 75 for preemptive transplants versus 39 and 49 percent for dialysis followed by transplantation, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The risk of death with a functioning allograft and all-cause mortality is also higher among patients who are dialyzed for more than six months before transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53436\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53436 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].</p><p>The duration of dialysis prior to transplantation may increase the risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In one registry study, patients on dialysis for more than 4.5 years before transplantation had a 60 percent greater risk of cancer compared with those on dialysis for less than 1.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS MODALITY BEFORE TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the associated risks, many patients need dialysis prior to transplantation.</p><p>Available dialysis modalities include hemodialysis, either in a dialysis center or at home, or peritoneal dialysis. There are no good, objective data to inform decisions regarding the choice of dialysis modality prior to transplantation. Practice patterns are center specific, and the choice of therapy is determined on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of patient preference and medical factors. The choice of modality generally depends on factors that are unrelated to transplantation; these include availability and convenience, comorbid conditions, socioeconomic and dialysis-center factors, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis modality and patient outcome&quot;, section on 'Selection of dialysis modality'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies that have compared pretransplant dialysis modalities on posttransplant outcomes have shown no clear benefit of one modality over others on overall graft or patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/23-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-33</a>]. One study of nearly 23,000 primary renal transplant recipients showed an unexpected 15 percent greater risk of death-censored graft failure among peritoneal dialysis-treated patients relative to those treated with hemodialysis prior to transplantation, with most of the risk confined to the early transplant period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52161 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. When the analysis was restricted to the first three months after transplantation, the relative risk for graft loss associated with peritoneal dialysis was 33 percent higher than that for hemodialysis. However, this observation was not confirmed in more recent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>The etiology of excess graft loss associated with pretransplant peritoneal dialysis, if present, is unclear. Limited data suggest that graft thrombosis may be higher among patients treated with peritoneal dialysis prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/28,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,36-38</a>]. The mechanism by which peritoneal dialysis predisposes to allograft thrombosis is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260397680\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine (ie, scheduled) dialysis should be avoided in the 24 hours prior to transplantation. This recommendation differs from that for patients undergoing nontransplant surgery, for whom dialysis is generally recommended in the 24 hours prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery#H649594083\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of the dialysis patient undergoing surgery&quot;, section on 'Routine dialysis prior to surgery'</a>.)</p><p>We avoid dialysis within 24 hours prior to transplantation because it may increase the risk of delayed graft function. The strong likelihood of renal recovery after transplantation makes even small risks associated with dialysis less acceptable.</p><p>The effect of elective dialysis on short-term posttransplantation outcomes is not certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. One study suggested that dialysis within 24 hours of transplantation increased the risk of delayed graft function, especially if a bioincompatible filter was used and ultrafiltration was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, in a trial that randomly assigned 110 patients to receive hemodialysis (one three-hour session without ultrafiltration) or no hemodialysis immediately prior to transplantation, there was no difference in delayed graft function or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) five days posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, avoidance of ultrafiltration for 16 to 24 hours before transplantation may help to reduce the risk of delayed graft function.</p><p>In addition to a possible risk of delayed graft function, dialysis may contribute to electrolyte and fluid shifts, which require several hours to equilibrate, and could theoretically contribute to sudden death. Although not studied in the transplant perioperative period, in a retrospective study of 80 chronic dialysis patients with documented sudden death, a 1.7 relative risk was observed in the 12-hour period beginning with the initiation of the dialysis treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Among nontransplant end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, this risk and other risks associated with dialysis are justified by the proven benefits provided by dialysis to patients with absent kidney function. By contrast, most patients undergoing transplantation have a rapid recovery of renal function postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-metabolic-and-hemodynamic-considerations#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury: Metabolic and hemodynamic considerations&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of hemodialysis-induced hypotension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-related-factors-that-may-influence-recovery-of-renal-function-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis-related factors that may influence recovery of renal function in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, despite the anticipated recovery of renal function, dialysis may be indicated in some transplant candidates to correct metabolic abnormalities that cannot be treated conservatively or pose unacceptable anesthesia risk. Hyperkalemia is the most common reason for dialysis in the immediate pretransplant period. Mild hyperkalemia at baseline is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may be exacerbated during surgery. In most cases, hyperkalemia resulting from transplant surgery is mild.</p><p>We generally dialyze patients who have a potassium &gt;5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], but there is variability between centers.</p><p>The threshold serum potassium at which it becomes unsafe to proceed with surgery without prior dialysis has not been evaluated among transplant patients, and there are no data that show that serum potassium should be normalized preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Volume overload is another potential indication for dialysis. Other indications for acute hemodialysis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H134900926\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications for dialysis therapy'</a>.)</p><p>When dialysis is required, ultrafiltration (ie, fluid removal) should be avoided in most transplant candidates because there is evidence that fluid shifts are associated with delayed graft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some patients, however, require dialysis to treat volume overload. For such patients, we suggest using a relatively low rate of ultrafiltration (such as 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour), which allows for adequate plasma refill and may avoid intravascular volume depletion and hypotension. Avoiding intravascular hypotension is particularly important because patients undergoing transplantation often receive intraoperative antibody preparations, which are associated with hypotension that could be exacerbated in a patient with recent, large ultrafiltration.</p><p>The length of the dialysis session should be tailored to the individual patient based on the goal of the treatment. Generally, hyperkalemia can be treated safely with two hours of dialysis. Patients who require ultrafiltration may require longer treatments (three to four hours) to remove volume safely and without inducing hypotension. Unlike patients who are not undergoing transplantation, urea kinetic modelling (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V)</span> should not be used to direct treatment, since there is an anticipation of renal recovery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-hemodialysis-prescription#H4049774965\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute hemodialysis prescription&quot;, section on 'Dialysis dose'</a>.)</p><p>The dialysate composition is the same as for nontransplant patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-hemodialysis-prescription#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute hemodialysis prescription&quot;, section on 'Dialysate composition'</a>). However, the flux of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and glucose should be minimized during the treatment, and the choice of potassium and bicarbonate baths should be made carefully to minimize the development of hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Dialysate temperature should also be tailored to each patient. We generally prefer a 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> calcium, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> magnesium, 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> constant sodium, and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> glucose dialysate bath. We adjust the dialysate temperature to typically be 0 to 1 degrees Celsius below the patient's body temperature.</p><p>Most outpatient dialysis treatments are performed with systemic anticoagulation utilizing heparin. It is preferred not to use heparin among patients who are undergoing transplantation with 24 hours of dialysis.</p><p>A biocompatible membrane should be used for all transplant patients who are undergoing dialysis prior to transplantation. Complement-activating or bioincompatible membrane dialyzers (eg, cuprophane dialyzers) have been associated with delayed graft function. As an example, in a study of 44 allograft recipients who were dialyzed within a 24-hour interval prior to transplantation, the recovery of renal function was higher among those dialyzed with the biocompatible membrane compared with a bioincompatible one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The need for dialysis in the first postoperative week after transplantation is called delayed graft function, regardless of the cause of kidney dysfunction.

We, and most nephrologists, perform hemodialysis after transplantation. This is because of the concern that the peritoneal membrane has been disrupted during transplant surgery, with the potential for leakage of glucose-containing peritoneal dialysate fluid and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Some authors have suggested removing the peritoneal dialysis catheter at the time of transplant surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, peritoneal dialysis has been used successfully in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Generally, there is no indication for continuous renal replacement therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The dialysis prescription is generally the same as for nontransplantation patients.

We generally target a weight (as a parameter of volume) that is within 1 to 2 kilograms of the patient's known dry weight with fluid removal not greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span>.<br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC DIALYSIS AFTER GRAFT FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may require dialysis after their transplanted kidney has failed. This may occur many years after the transplantation. The indications for initiating maintenance dialysis among transplant recipients with a failing allograft are the same as for nontransplant patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-initiation-of-dialysis-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for initiation of dialysis in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who return to dialysis after graft loss have a high mortality rate, even when compared with dialysis patients who have never received a transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. As an example, a study of Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data demonstrated a 78 percent increase in mortality among patients who returned to dialysis after a transplant compared with those on the transplant waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. When results were analyzed at different intervals after graft failure, the largest increase in mortality was noted during the first week after graft failure.</p><p>Mortality is considerably higher than in patients who have continued allograft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, less than 40 percent of such patients survive 10 years as compared with more than 75 percent of patients with a functioning kidney transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The annual adjusted death rate is over three times higher than the death rate during the period of time when the transplant is functioning (9.42 versus 2.81 per 100 patient-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p>The exact reasons for the increased mortality are undefined but are likely to be related in part to the recurrence of renal failure independent of a requirement for dialysis. In one study, the increase in serum creatinine one year after transplantation was directly related to cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Transplant recipients who return to dialysis also tend to lose residual renal function quickly; loss of residual renal function is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output and residual kidney function in kidney failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical importance of residual kidney function'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis#H14176514\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;, section on 'Residual renal function'</a>.)</p><p>Given the high mortality, the appropriate timing of dialysis initiation and the aggressive management of comorbid conditions associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are critical in optimizing survival in patients with a failing allograft. Unfortunately, it is common to delay the initiation of dialysis after graft loss until clearances have fallen well below recommended targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>In addition, patients commonly initiate dialysis with a central venous catheter rather than the preferred arteriovenous fistula despite the well-recognized infection risk associated with catheters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This was demonstrated in the following retrospective studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of 16,728 patients with failed transplants who initiated dialysis between January 2006 and September 2011, 65 percent initiated dialysis with a central venous catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 683 patients who started dialysis after allograft failure, 47 percent had a vascular access created in the 24 months after initiation of dialysis, and only 16 percent had an access created in the 12 months prior to dialysis initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Coronary artery disease, diabetes, and peritoneal dialysis prior to transplantation were associated with lower rates of pre-dialysis access creation.</p><p/><p>The detriment of this approach is suggested in an analysis of 186 patients returning to dialysis where 40 percent of infections were dialysis catheter-related bacteremia episodes, with the six-month absolute risk in patients on immunosuppression being 12 versus 8 percent in patients weaned from immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This may be particularly concerning in patients with diabetes who have a significantly increased risk of infection-related death after transplant failure compared with patients with glomerulonephritis or hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The optimal dialysis modality after allograft loss in these patients is unclear. In general, the choice between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis generally depends on factors that are unrelated to transplantation. Similar survival rates have been reported with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/56,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,63,64</a>].</p><p>One study suggested that patient survival and peritonitis-free survival are similar in those with failed allograft function who subsequently undergo peritoneal dialysis compared with those who undergo peritoneal dialysis after the loss of native kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This differs from studies of patients on hemodialysis that have shown increased mortality among patients who have had a transplant. However, follow-up was limited to 15 months in this study, and we do not believe that these are sufficient data to recommend peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>Given the high mortality associated with the return to dialysis after transplantation, it may be reasonable to consider a more intensive dialysis regimen (such as daily hemodialysis) than conventional hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in patients after allograft loss. However, a patient survival benefit of these therapies has not been demonstrated among transplant patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63438504\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF SECOND TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest preemptive transplantation for most patients after the first transplanted kidney has failed. This is consistent with the 2014 British Transplantation Society Guidelines for the Management of the Failing Kidney Transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The one exception is when the first transplanted kidney has failed within one year.</p><p>Prolonged waiting times for a second kidney transplant are associated with inferior graft and patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In one study of 911 recipients of a second kidney transplant, the relative risk of acute rejection at six months, overall graft failure, and all-cause mortality increased by 11, 6, and 13 percent, respectively, for every one-year increase in waiting time before the second transplant. </p><p>Preemptive transplantation is preferred for most patients because overall graft and patient survival has been shown to be substantially better among patients who receive a preemptive second transplant compared with patients who receive a second transplant after a period of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In one study, preemptive second transplantation, compared with nonpreemptive second transplantation, was associated with a decreased risk of graft failure due to any cause (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.96) and death with a functioning allograft (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.87). The risk of death-censored graft failure was the same between groups.</p><p>Patients who have early failure of the first kidney transplant (ie, less than one year from transplantation) may have improved graft survival with a short period of dialysis prior to a second transplantation. Analyses of USRDS data have shown a 34 to 36 percent higher risk of graft failure in patients who undergo preemptive retransplantation in comparison with those retransplanted after a period of dialysis (more than six days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p>Among patients with early graft failure of the first transplanted kidney, the optimal duration of dialysis prior to the second transplant is not known.

Thus, we avoid a prolonged period of dialysis prior to the second transplant.</p><p>We agree with the British Transplantation Society Guidelines that suitable patients should be evaluated for repeat transplantation when graft survival is estimated to be less than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33915669\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), we suggest preemptive transplantation rather than waiting until dialysis is initiated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Preemptive transplantation is associated with improved patient and graft survival when compared with transplantation after a period of dialysis therapy.<br/><br/>Exceptions are for patients who have nephrotic syndrome and patients who are undergoing a second transplant after the first transplanted kidney has failed within one year from transplantation. Such patients may benefit from a short period of dialysis prior to transplantation.

We generally refer potential candidates for evaluation by a transplant team when the eGFR is &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The evaluation of transplant candidates and identification of a suitable donor may be prolonged, and timely referral is likely to prevent the requirement for dialysis prior to transplantation.
