It is most often induced by drug therapy. AIN is also caused by autoimmune disorders or other systemic disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis), a variety of infections remote to the kidney (eg, <em>Legionella</em>, leptospirosis, and streptococcal organisms), and tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (TINU) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/2-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-10</a>].</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AIN is presented in this topic review.

The interval between the onset of these drugs and detection of AIN is very variable (from one week to nine months), although 10 to 11 weeks is the most common interval. In many cases, it is difficult to establish a temporal relationship between PPI consumption and AIN given the frequent discontinuity in their intake and the sparse symptoms associated with PPI-induced AIN. One study found that renal function decline in PPI-induced AIN was less severe than in antibiotic-induced AIN, but the possibility of recovery at six months was lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. PPIs are one of the most frequently prescribed drug classes worldwide. Studies have suggested that repeated episodes of PPI-induced AIN, many of them undetected, can contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and, indeed, an association between consumption of PPI and the presence of CKD has been found in epidemiological studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

IgG4-related disease is a systemic disorder that was initially described in 2003 and reported to cause tubulointerstitial nephritis in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. IgG4-related disease is characterized by the infiltration of multiple organs by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate that is rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, resulting in diverse clinical manifestations, including autoimmune pancreatitis, enlarged lacrimal and salivary glands and periorbital tissue, and tubulointerstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Kidneys are reportedly involved in approximately 30 percent of cases of IgG4-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/47,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,56</a>]. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most commonly associated renal lesion, although glomerular lesions (mostly membranous nephropathy) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. In a case series from Japan, among 153 patients with IgG4-related disease, 23 patients (15 percent) had tubulointerstitial nephritis, and two patients had a concurrent membranous nephropathy lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The clinical and laboratory features that characterize IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis are described below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypocomplementemic tubulointerstitial nephritis, described in a small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and a number of case reports, is characterized by massive tubulointerstitial deposits and lymphoid or plasma cell infiltration observed on kidney biopsy and systemic hypocomplementemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. It is possible that many of the early reports of hypocomplementemic tubulointerstitial nephritis were due to IgG4-related disease, which is also characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and systemic hypocomplementemia, since IgG4 immunostaining was not available at the time of the initial reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, both IgG4-positive and IgG4-negative cases of hypocomplementemic interstitial nephritis have since been diagnosed at the same institution that reported the defining case series, suggesting that these diseases should be considered distinct entities.</p><p>A rare cause of AIN is due to anti-tubular basement membrane (TBM) antibodies, leading to linear staining with immunoglobulin along the TBMs on immunofluorescence microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. This can occur in the presence or absence of concurrent anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>] and has been described in patients with membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

In one review, compared with patients ages 18 to 64 years (n = 88), patients older than 65 years (n = 45) were more likely to have drug-induced AIN (64 versus 87 percent) and less likely to have AIN related to autoimmune or systemic diseases (27 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There is no known biologic reason for this predilection, which is most likely related to polypharmacy in older individuals. In addition, some systemic diseases that cause tubulointerstitial nephritis are more frequent among older individuals. The most common causative agents among older patients were penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2974465447\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIN is demonstrated in 1 to 3 percent of all renal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. When analysis is restricted to biopsies performed in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), the percentage rises to 13 to 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest that the incidence of AIN is increasing, particularly among older subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/13,31,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31,64</a>]. The reasons for this change are complex and difficult to assess but may include an aging population base, increasing polypharmacy (including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) in older people, and an increasingly less restrictive policy of renal biopsies in older patients with AKI. The true incidence of AIN may also be underestimated for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A confirmatory renal biopsy is often not done in older and frail patients; empirical treatment is often preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of AIN caused by PPIs, 5-aminosalicylates, and NSAIDs and often without obvious associated symptoms is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Granuloma formation also suggests a greater likelihood of infection-induced AIN compared with AIN without granulomas. In a review of 40 biopsies of patients with granulomatous renal disease (including 37 patients with interstitial nephritis, two with associated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, and one with vasculitis), sarcoidosis was present in 20 patients (50 percent) and drug-induced and <em>Mycobacterium</em> infection present in seven (18 percent) and five (13 percent), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Similarly to AIN, renal atheroemboli may present with eosinophiluria, eosinophilia, and skin lesions. However, the skin lesions associated with atheroemboli are more commonly reticular (livedo reticularis) with digital infarcts, whereas the characteristic rash associated with AIN is a diffuse, maculopapular one. The history may also distinguish between AIN and renal atheroemboli since the majority of cases of atheroemboli are preceded by an endovascular procedure.

As discussed above, the vast majority of cases of AIN are caused by a drug. A careful review of medications, including the timing of initiation in relation to the onset of acute kidney injury (AKI), may reveal the likely culprit agent.</p><p>Less commonly, a drug is not identified. Among such patients, a histologic diagnosis of AIN should provoke a search for underlying infection and systemic disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis.</p><p>In some cases, histologic features may suggest the underlying disease that is associated with AIN. As an example, granulomas are more likely to be seen in patients with sarcoidosis than in other forms of AIN. Additionally, AIN related to SLE may be accompanied by characteristic glomerular lesions. Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease may be suggested by the presence of tubular basement membrane (TBM) immune complex deposits and an increase in immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-positive plasma cells in the interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Drugs, particularly antibiotics, are the most common cause of AIN. Other causes include autoimmune disorders, infections, sarcoidosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (TINU) syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs that most commonly cause AIN are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including selective cyclooxygenase [COX]-2 inhibitors), penicillins and cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, antimicrobial sulfonamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and other quinolones, diuretics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a>, and 5-aminosalicylates (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesalamine</a>). Many other drugs can occasionally cause AIN. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections that have been associated with AIN include <em>Legionella</em>, <em>Leptospira</em>, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and <em>Streptococcus</em>. Other, less commonly associated organisms include <em>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</em>, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), <em>Yersinia</em>, and polyomavirus. <em>Mycobacterium</em> infection is associated with a granulomatous variant of AIN. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune disorders that have been associated with AIN include sarcoidosis, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener&rsquo;s). Rare causes of AIN are immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease, anti-tubular basement membrane (TBM) antibodies, hypocomplementemic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and the TINU syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Associated with systemic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with AIN present with nonspecific signs and symptoms associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Signs and symptoms of an allergic-type reaction may be present, including rash, fever, and eosinophilia, although only 10 percent of patients have the full triad of rash, fever, and eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients generally present with a rise in the plasma creatinine concentration, which (if drug induced) is temporally related to administration of the offending drug. Urine sediment usually reveals white cells, red cells, and white cell casts. Urinary eosinophils may be present but lack the specificity and sensitivity to either exclude or diagnose AIN. Protein excretion is usually only mildly or moderately increased. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and radiographic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-significance-of-urinary-eosinophils\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The significance of urinary eosinophils&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIN should be suspected in a patient who presents with an elevated serum creatinine and a urinalysis that shows white cells, white cell casts, and, in some cases, eosinophiluria. Drug-induced AIN should be suspected when the onset of characteristic laboratory findings are temporally related to the initiation of a new drug, particularly one that has been previously reported to cause AIN. A definitive diagnosis of AIN is made by renal biopsy. Selected patients with suspected AIN will benefit from renal biopsy. (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have a histologic diagnosis of AIN and are not on a drug known to cause AIN should be evaluated for an underlying etiology.
