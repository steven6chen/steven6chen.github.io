Several other scoring systems also exist to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis based upon clinical, laboratory, radiologic risk factors, and serum markers but can be used only 24 to 48 hours after disease onset and have not been shown to be consistently superior to assessment of SIRS or the APACHE II score.

In patients with severe volume depletion that manifests as hypotension and tachycardia, we provide more rapid repletion with 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of intravenous fluid given over 30 minutes followed by 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for 8 to 12 hours. In rare patients with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia, lactated Ringer's is contraindicated because it contains 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> calcium. In these patients, normal saline should be used for volume resuscitation. Several other approaches to fluid replacement have also been reported in patients with acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Fluid requirements should be reassessed at frequent intervals in the first six hours of admission and for the next 24 to 48 hours. The rate of fluid resuscitation should be adjusted based on clinical assessment, hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Adequate fluid replacement can be assessed by an improvement in vital signs (goal heart rate &lt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute,</span> mean arterial pressure between 65 to 85 mmHg), urine output (&gt;0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour)</span> and reduction in hematocrit (goal 35 to 44 percent) and BUN over 24 hours, particularly if they were high at the onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Monitoring the BUN may be particularly important, as both the BUN at the time of admission and the change in BUN during the first 24 hours of hospitalization predict mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Increased fluid resuscitation should be considered in patients whose BUN levels stay the same or increase. It is important to note that a low urine output may reflect the development of acute tubular necrosis rather than persistent volume depletion. In this setting, aggressive fluid replacement can lead to peripheral and pulmonary edema without improving the urine output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)<br/></p><p>In the initial stages (within the first 12 to 24 hours) of acute pancreatitis, fluid replacement has been associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/5,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-17</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution may reduce the incidence of SIRS as compared with normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one small randomized trial of 40 patients, patients who received lactated Ringer's had significantly lower mean C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared with patients who received normal saline (52 versus 104 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and a significant reduction in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after 24 hours (84 versus 0 percent). <br/><br/>Inadequate hydration can lead to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis. Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hours has been associated with development of necrotizing pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Necrotizing pancreatitis results in vascular leak syndrome leading to increased third space fluid losses and worsening of pancreatic hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, it is important to limit fluid resuscitation mainly to the first 24 to 48 hours after onset of the disease. Continued aggressive fluid resuscitation after 48 hours may not be advisable as overly-vigorous fluid resuscitation is associated with an increased need for intubation and increased risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is often the predominant symptom in patients with acute pancreatitis and should be treated with analgesics. Uncontrolled pain can contribute to the hemodynamic instability.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention to adequate fluid resuscitation should be the first priority in addressing abdominal pain, as hypovolemia from vascular leak and hemoconcentration can cause ischemic pain and resultant lactic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H22664712\" class=\"local\">'Fluid replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids are safe and effective at providing pain control in patients with acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Adequate pain control requires the use of intravenous opiates, usually in the form of a patient-controlled analgesia pump. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydromorphone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (intravenous) may be used for pain relief in acute pancreatitis. Fentanyl is being increasingly used due to its better safety profile, especially in renal impairment. As with other opiates, fentanyl can depress respiratory function. It can be given both as a bolus as well as constant infusion. The typical dose for the bolus regimen ranges from 20 to 50 micrograms with a 10-minute lock-out period (time from the end of one dose infusion to the time the machine starts responding to another demand). Patients on patient-controlled analgesia should be carefully monitored for side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient#H108948142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;, section on 'Type and management of side effects'</a>.)<br/><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Meperidine</a> has been favored over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> for analgesia in pancreatitis because studies showed that morphine caused an increase in sphincter of Oddi pressure. However, there are no clinical studies to suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, meperidine has a short half-life and repeated doses can lead to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine that causes neuromuscular side effects and, rarely, seizures. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106843768\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute pancreatitis should be monitored closely in the first 24 to 48 hours. Patients with organ failure will need ongoing monitoring for other complications that might arise. (See <a href=\"#H540132454\" class=\"local\">'Management of complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs including oxygen saturation should be monitored and supplemental oxygen administered to maintain arterial oxygen saturation of greater than 95 percent. Blood gas analysis should be performed if oxygen saturation is less than 90 percent or if the clinical situation demands. Hypoxia may be due to splinting, atelectasis, pleural effusions, opening of intrapulmonary shunts, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with persistent or progressive hypoxia should be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilatory support.

Hypocalcemia should be corrected if ionized calcium is low or if there are signs of neuromuscular irritability (Chvostek's or Trousseau's sign).

Nutritional support is often required in patients with moderately severe pancreatitis and almost invariably needed in patients with severe pancreatitis as they are unlikely to resume oral intake within five to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Nasojejunal tube feeding (using an elemental or semi-elemental formula) is preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34183426\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time to reinitiate oral feedings depends on the severity of the pancreatitis.

This usually occurs 24 to 48 hours after the onset of pancreatitis. We usually start with a low residue, low fat, soft diet, provided there is no evidence of ileus or significant nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting. We then advance the diet cautiously as tolerated. Traditionally, patients have been advanced from a clear liquid diet to solid food as tolerated. Early refeeding with a solid, low fat diet when patients are subjectively hungry, regardless of resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of pancreatic enzymes, may be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In moderately severe to severe pancreatitis, oral feeding may not be tolerated due to postprandial pain, nausea or vomiting related to gastroduodenal inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extrinsic compression from fluid collections leading to gastric outlet obstruction. Patients may require enteral or parenteral feeding if caloric and protein needs are not met. However, when the local complications start improving, oral feeds can be initiated and advanced as tolerated. </p><p/><p>In a systematic review of 11 randomized trials that included 948 patients with acute pancreatitis, early refeeding (&le;48 after hospitalization), as compared with delayed refeeding, did not increase adverse effects or exacerbate symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In four of seven trials that included patients with mild to moderate pancreatitis, early refeeding was associated with a reduction in length of hospital stay. However, there was significant heterogeneity in feeding protocols and reported outcomes across studies and a high risk of bias in several studies included in the systematic review. Additional randomized trials are needed to define the benefits of early refeeding in patients with acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-oral enteral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral feeding rather than parenteral nutrition is recommended in patients with moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis who cannot tolerate oral feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/3-5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,31</a>]. We initiate non-oral enteral feeding when it becomes clear that the patient will not be able to consume nourishment by mouth (eg, transfer to an intensive care unit, development of organ failure, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] persisting for 48 hours). This assessment can usually be made within the first three to four days of illness.</p><p>Some nutritional guidelines have suggested that enteral nutrition be initiated early (within 24 to 48 hours) in all patients with severe acute pancreatitis to decrease the risk of major infection, although evidence to support this recommendation is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/23,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32-34</a>]. In a randomized trial, 208 patients with severe acute pancreatitis were assigned to early nasoenteric tube feeding (within 24 hours of randomization) or an oral diet at 72 hours with on-demand nasoenteric tube feeding if an oral diet was not tolerated at 96 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There was no difference in the primary endpoint (composite of major infection or death at six months) between patients who received early or on-demand nasoenteric tube feeding (30 versus 27 percent, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.8-1.4). There were also no significant differences in the rates of infection and death between the two groups. In the oral diet and on-demand tube feeding group, 32 patients (31 percent) required nasoenteric tube feeding.</p><p>Non-oral enteral feeding requires radiologic or endoscopic placement of a jejunal feeding tube beyond the ligament of Treitz. If placement of a nasojejunal feeding tube is not possible, nasogastric feeding should be initiated. Two controlled trials comparing nasogastric with nasojejunal feedings found no significant differences in APACHE II scores, CRP levels, pain, or analgesic requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. However, another small study comparing nasogastric feeding with TPN noted increased pulmonary and total complications in the nasogastric group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Further studies are needed before nasogastric feeding can be routinely recommended. </p><p>We use high protein, low fat, semi-elemental feeding formulas (eg, Peptamen AF) because of a reduction in pancreatic digestive enzymes. We start at 25 cc per hour and advance as tolerated to at least 30 percent of the calculated daily requirement (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> ideal body weight), even in the presence of ileus. Signs that the formula is not tolerated include increased abdominal pain, vomiting (with nasogastric feeding), bloating, or diarrhea (&gt;5 watery stools or &gt;500 mL per 24 hours with exclusion of <em>Clostridium difficile </em>toxin and medication-induced diarrhea) that resolves if the feeding is held.</p><p>Enteral nutrition helps maintain the intestinal barrier and prevents bacterial translocation from the gut. Another advantage of enteral nutrition is the avoidance of the complications associated with parenteral nutrition including those secondary to venous access and blood stream infections. Consistent with prior meta-analyses, a 2010 meta-analysis of eight trials demonstrated that enteral nutrition significantly reduced mortality, multiple organ failure, systemic infections, and the need for surgery as compared with those who received parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. </p><p>The presence of fluid collections or elevated pancreatic enzymes is not necessarily a contraindication to enteral feeding. However, in a subgroup of patients there is clear correlation of pain, recurrence of pancreatitis, or worsening of fluid collections with feeding. These patients often have disrupted pancreatic ducts with fluid collections. Drainage of fluid collections may allow resumption of oral intake.

However, biliary sludge is commonly found in 20 to 40 percent of patients with acute pancreatitis with no other obvious cause. On ultrasound, sludge appears as a mobile, low-amplitude echo that layers in the most dependent part of the gallbladder and is not associated with shadowing. However, ultrasound has a low sensitivity for biliary sludge. If the cause is not clear, we perform EUS, even after one attack, to look for microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct. Cholecystectomy should be performed in patients who have had an episode of pancreatitis and have biliary sludge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. Studies suggest that biliary sludge can lead to pancreatitis and that these patients may benefit from intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. In a randomized trial, 85 patients, after their first attack of idiopathic acute pancreatitis, were assigned to laparoscopic cholecystectomy or conservative watchful waiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-pancreatitis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. During a median follow-up of 36 months, significantly fewer patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy had recurrent idiopathic acute pancreatitis as compared with controls (10 versus 30 percent). A total of five patients needed to be treated to prevent one episode of what was thought to be idiopathic acute pancreatitis. However, EUS was not performed to detect small gallstones or biliary sludge. Biliary stones or sludge were detected during surgery in 23 of 39 patients (59 percent) who underwent cholecystectomy.

Acute pancreatitis can be divided into two broad categories: edematous, interstitial acute pancreatitis and necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Mild acute pancreatitis is characterized by the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by no organ failure or transient organ failure (&lt;48 hours) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local complications. Severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by persistent organ failure (&gt;48 hours) that may involve one or multiple organs. (See <a href=\"#H106843438\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At initial evaluation, the severity of acute pancreatitis should be assessed by clinical examination to assess for early fluid losses, organ failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87718 \">table 1</a>), measurement of the APACHE II score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apache-ii-scoring-system-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score. Routine abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is not recommended at initial presentation in patients with acute pancreatitis unless there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H446700317\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of disease severity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=predicting-the-severity-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Admission to a monitored or intensive care unit is indicated in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and in patients with acute pancreatitis who meet one or more of the following parameters (see <a href=\"#H106843693\" class=\"local\">'Indications for monitored or intensive care'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulse &lt;40 or &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systolic arterial pressure &lt;80 mmHg or mean arterial pressure &lt;60 mmHg or diastolic arterial pressure &gt;120 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory rate &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum sodium &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> or &gt;170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> serum potassium &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> or &gt;7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> serum glucose &gt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> serum calcium &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;50 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>pH &lt;7.1 or &gt;7.7</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pancreatitis is treated with supportive care including pain control, intravenous fluids especially during the first 24 hours, and correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. The majority of patients with mild pancreatitis require no further therapy, and recover within three to seven days. Patients with moderately severe and severe pancreatitis require more intensive monitoring as they have transient (&lt;48 hours) or persistent (&gt;48 hours) organ failure and local or systemic complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain is often the predominant symptom in patients with acute pancreatitis. Adequate pain control requires the use of intravenous opiates, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, usually in the form of a patient-controlled analgesia pump. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild pancreatitis, recovery generally occurs quickly, making it unnecessary to initiate supplemental nutrition. A soft diet can be started as soon as the pain is decreasing and inflammatory markers are improving. We usually start with a low-residue, low-fat, and soft diet, provided there is no evidence of ileus or significant nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting. <br/><br/>In patients with severe pancreatitis, we recommend enteral nutrition through a nasojejunal tube placed endoscopically or radiologically rather than initiating parenteral nutrition (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If the target rate is not achieved within 48 to 72 hours and if severe acute pancreatitis is not resolved, supplemental parenteral nutrition should be provided. (See <a href=\"#H34183426\" class=\"local\">'Oral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Non-oral enteral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderately severe or severe acute pancreatitis, signs of sepsis, or clinical deterioration 72 hours after initial presentation, should undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan to assess the presence of pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis and local complications. Patients with persistent organ failure and extensive local complications should be transferred to centers of expertise. (See <a href=\"#H540132454\" class=\"local\">'Management of complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pancreatitis may develop local or systemic complications. Local complications of acute pancreatitis include acute peripancreatic fluid collection, pancreatic pseudocyst, acute necrotic collection (ANC), and walled-off necrosis (WON) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87683 \">table 3</a>). While acute peripancreatic fluid collections and acute necrotic collections may develop less than four weeks after the onset of pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis usually occur more than four weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H547873037\" class=\"local\">'Local complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both ANC and WON are initially sterile but may become infected. The occurrence of pancreatic infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Infected necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88436\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88436 \">image 4</a>) should be suspected in patients with pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis who deteriorate (clinical instability or sepsis physiology, increasing white blood cell count, fevers) or fail to improve after 7 to 10 days of hospitalization. In patients with suspected infected necrosis, we suggest empiric antibiotics rather than CT-guided fine needle aspiration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H106842171\" class=\"local\">'Acute necrotic collection and walled-off necrosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with infected necrosis who fail to respond to antibiotics or who are clinically unstable, we recommend pancreatic debridement rather than continued conservative management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Where possible we attempt to delay intervention until four weeks after initial presentation to allow the infected necrosis to become walled off. We perform necrosectomy with minimally invasive methods and reserve open surgical debridement for patients who are clinically unstable or if minimally invasive debridement is not possible or fails. (See <a href=\"#H106842171\" class=\"local\">'Acute necrotic collection and walled-off necrosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with gallstone pancreatitis, we recommend urgent (&lt;24 hours) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy for patients with cholangitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Cholecystectomy should be performed after recovery from acute pancreatitis in all operable patients with gallstone pancreatitis or biliary sludge.
