The choice of treatment is determined by a variety of factors, including patient preference, clinician judgment, and resource availability.

The prostate gland is a midline structure that lies in close proximity to the rectum and bladder. Thus, the major toxicities of normal tissue irradiation are gastrointestinal and genitourinary.</p><p>Definitive RT is usually delivered to the entire prostate gland because of the multifocal nature of prostate cancer and the inability to accurately localize all malignant areas within the gland by noninvasive means. Treatment fields are further individualized based upon the estimated risk of seminal vesicle and regional lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The lymphatic drainage of the prostate gland is through a periprostatic network that drains into both the external and internal iliac lymph nodes (together referred to as pelvic nodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Higher clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, and Gleason score are associated with an increased risk of both seminal vesicle and pelvic lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The serum PSA and Gleason score have been incorporated into the anatomic stage prognostic groups of the eighth (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a>). For patients at high risk of relapse, RT to the whole pelvis, which encompasses the bilateral lymph node regions, is sometimes utilized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-risk-stratification-and-choice-of-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial staging and evaluation of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL BEAM RT TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conformal techniques, particularly intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and image-guided RT (IGRT), are the contemporary standard of care when external beam RT is used to treat localized prostate cancer. These conformal techniques allow higher doses to the target while minimizing radiation to normal tissues compared with older two-dimensional approaches. This improved targeting permits a decrease in toxicity and an improvement in therapeutic index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional conformal RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) delivers radiation to a three-dimensional volume using imaging studies and computer software to precisely target RT delivery by delineating the prostate gland and its surrounding structures. Because treatment margins are smaller than with older techniques, the volume of normal tissue receiving a clinically significant radiation dose is reduced.</p><p>The prostate, rectum, and bladder are identified on axial pelvic computed tomography (CT) images. Treatment planning computers then calculate the dose in three dimensions, and the beam arrangements are planned to the prostate target volume (the gross tumor volume [GTV]) plus a margin of grossly normal surrounding tissue, termed the clinical target volume (CTV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The planning target volume (PTV) is the final treatment volume that encompasses the GTV, CTV, and a margin for any error that results from daily set-up and prostatic motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Either multileaf collimation or cerrobend blocks are used to shape the treatment portals. Dose-volume histograms, which are the visual representation of the dose received by a particular target volume, permit the radiation oncologist to assign a specific RT dose to a particular volume of tissue, maximizing the delivery of the highest doses to the areas at highest risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensity-modulated RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IMRT is an advanced form of 3D-CRT that can create a dose distribution around a complex and irregular target volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72560\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72560 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54616 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. IMRT delivers nonuniform beam intensities to the target volume by changing the intensity of the beam, in contrast to 3D-CRT, in which a uniform intensity is administered to a defined field. The nonuniform beam intensity can be generated by varying the opening of the RT beam (collimator) with a fixed gantry position or by changing the beam opening during an arc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatively, the beam intensity in IMRT can also be modulated by the gantry speed as in <span class=\"nowrap\">rotational/arc</span> delivery approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>IMRT can safely escalate the dose to the prostate while reducing complications from irradiation of surrounding normal tissue, especially the rectum. The high degree of conformality of the RT field permits further dose escalation to the tumor target compared with 3D-CRT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">IMRT versus 3D-CRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IMRT is considered the standard of care in RT treatment centers; in both the United States and Europe, it has largely replaced older forms of 3D-CRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Although there are no randomized trials comparing IMRT with 3D-CRT, IMRT appears to be less toxic at equivalent tumor doses of radiation by reducing the exposure of normal tissue to radiation. Furthermore, IMRT may have important dosimetric advantages in treating pelvic lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>], where it allows better coverage while reducing radiation to the rectum, colon, small bowel, bladder, and penile structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The toxicity of IMRT was compared with that of 3D-CRT in the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0126 prostate cancer trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In that study, 763 patients were randomly assigned to receive 79.2 Gy; of these, 257 were treated with IMRT, and 492 were treated with 3D-CRT. Grade 2 or higher genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was significantly less frequent with IMRT compared with 3D-CRT (15.1 versus 9.7 percent).</p><p>IMRT may have increased toxicity when escalated radiation doses are compared with the lower doses with older 3D-CRT techniques. In a single-institution series of 1571 men treated for localized prostate cancer, IMRT was used to treat 741 patients to a dose of 81 Gy while 830 men were treated with 3D-CRT at lower doses (358 at &le;70.2 Gy and 472 at 75.6 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Acute urinary symptoms requiring treatment were significantly more frequent with IMRT than 3D-CRT (37 versus 22 percent), while acute rectal symptoms were uncommon with either modality (3 and 1 percent, respectively). Late urinary tract toxicity (frequency or urgency, incontinence, hematuria, stricture) was significantly more frequent in patients treated with IMRT (20 versus 12 percent). Patients treated with IMRT had a significantly decreased frequency of grade &ge;2 gastrointestinal toxicity at 10 years (5 versus 13 percent with 3D-CRT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Image-guided RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IGRT is a 3D-CRT technique that acquires two- or three-dimensional images prior to each treatment, thus tracking the location of the tumor and surrounding organs. Commonly used imaging approaches for prostate IGRT include gold marker (fiducial) tracking with megavoltage portal imaging, kilovoltage (kV) imaging, abdominal ultrasound, or CT. IGRT provides accurate localization of the prostate gland, which can vary on a daily basis.</p><p>Over the last several years, the use of IGRT in prostate cancer RT has grown substantially. Most investigators have concluded that IGRT allows treating clinicians to reduce target volumes and may be useful to reduce treatment-related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>IGRT was compared with older 3D-CRT techniques in 475 patients from the control arms of two randomized trials, both of which administered 78 Gy in 39 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Analyses of dose contours found a decrease in radiation dose to the bladder and anorectum with IGRT compared with 3D-CRT (33 versus 43 and 24 versus 45 Gy, respectively). Analyses of acute toxicity found that, during the first year, there was a decrease in both grade &ge;2 urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity (38 versus 48 and 29 versus 49 percent, respectively).</p><p>Definitive evidence that IGRT reduces morbidity and improves the efficacy of prostate cancer treatment compared with older techniques will require carefully conducted clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Particle irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Particle beams interact with tissue similar to X-rays, but heavier particles, such as neutrons or carbon, cause greater levels of ionization per unit length and an increased radiobiologic effect (RBE) compared with photons, which lack mass. The most extensive data are available for particle beams using protons; there is more limited, ongoing research with carbon ions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824853\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Particle therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920638\"><span class=\"h3\">Proton beam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The theoretical advantage of proton beam therapy is in its dose distribution. The physical characteristics of the proton beam result in the majority of the energy being deposited at the end of a linear track, in what is called the Bragg peak. The radiation dose then falls rapidly to zero beyond the Bragg peak. However, there can be some uncertainty about the exact location of the Bragg peak due to tissue inhomogeneities (eg, bone, air). Proton beam therapy thus permits the delivery of high doses of RT to the target volume while limiting the &quot;scatter&quot; dose received by surrounding tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H781215576\"><span class=\"h3\">Proton beam versus external beam RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of proton beam RT is expanding as more proton beam treatment centers open. However, there are no randomized trials that compare proton beam therapy with photon therapy or brachytherapy in men with clinically localized prostate cancer. A systematic review of the available evidence from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) on efficacy and toxicity concluded that outcomes were similar with proton beam therapy and IMRT using photons but did not demonstrate a benefit for the proton beam approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Results from large observational series include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis from the Medicare Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database identified 684 men treated with proton beam therapy between 2002 and 2007 and compared these with a cohort treated using IMRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. IMRT was associated with significantly less gastrointestinal morbidity. However, there were no significant statistically significant differences in other toxicities, nor was there a significant difference in the frequency with which patients required additional cancer therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of early toxicity compared 421 men treated for prostate cancer with proton beam therapy with 842 matched controls treated with IMRT in the Medicare database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Patients were treated from 2008 to 2009. There was a statistically significant decrease in genitourinary toxicity at six months, but this difference had disappeared by one year. There were no other significant differences in toxicity between the two techniques at either six months or one year. The costs associated with proton beam therapy were approximately 75 percent higher compared with IMRT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another analysis compared outcomes in patients with localized prostate cancer treated between 1996 and 1999 with high-dose radiation using photons plus proton beam or brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There was no difference in the primary outcome, biochemical progression-free survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H920645\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbon ion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon ion RT is being evaluated, primarily in a series of studies in Japan, as an alternative form of particle irradiation to treat men with prostate cancer. In an analysis of 2157 patients treated at four institutions, the five-year biochemical relapse-free survival rates for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease were 92, 89, and 92 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. No grade 3 toxicities were observed, and the rates of grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 4.6 and 0.4 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3132687\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial choice of treatment approach and the interpretation of outcomes in men with localized prostate cancer require stratification for known pretreatment prognostic factors, including clinical stage (tumor [T], lymph node [N], metastasis [M]), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a>).

Now, a rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following RT is almost universally used as an endpoint for treatment failure and is termed &quot;biochemical recurrence.&quot; Men without a rise in serum PSA following treatment are considered biochemically without evidence of disease (bNED). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Follow-up surveillance during and after treatment for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3124870\"><span class=\"h3\">Definition of biochemical recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of biochemical failure after definitive RT is complicated by the presence of normal prostatic glandular tissue that remains following RT. Furthermore, the decline in serum PSA following RT is gradual, and the mean time for the PSA to reach its nadir is 18 months or longer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>In an effort to standardize the criteria used to define progression, a consensus panel convened by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in 1996 established criteria for defining biochemical failure in patients who had been treated with external beam RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These criteria were modified by ASTRO in 2005 as the so-called Phoenix criteria, which are now widely used for patients treated with RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Definition of biochemical progression'</a>.)</p><p>The Phoenix criteria define biochemical (PSA) failure as a rise in serum PSA of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or more above the nadir, regardless of whether or not a patient receives androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The date of failure is defined by the time the rise in the PSA by &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> above the nadir is observed. This definition, however, was not designed to determine cure rates but rather the presence of a clinically significant recurrence and, thus, should not be used to compare with other modalities.</p><p>Although biochemical progression is universally accepted as an endpoint to define treatment failure, overt metastatic disease may not become evident for many years after a rising serum PSA is detected. The natural history of disease in men with an isolated rising serum PSA without clinical evidence of metastases is discussed separately.

Rebiopsy is only indicated if the serum PSA is rising and further local therapy is being considered, since some of these men are curable with salvage retreatment (eg, surgery, brachytherapy, cryosurgery). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer#H11086744\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Follow-up surveillance during and after treatment for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Surveillance strategies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA after radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Salvage local therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The time course of disappearance of viable cancer from the prostate following RT can be prolonged. This is thought to be due to the long doubling time of many prostate tumors and the observation that cell death following RT is a postmitotic event. As a result, false-positive biopsies may be due to delayed tumor regression, and indeterminate biopsies (showing either atypical cells or radiation effect in tumor cells) are of uncertain significance. Nonetheless, the persistence of viable-appearing tumor cells beyond 18 months does appear to predict a greater likelihood of treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p>The histologic changes induced by RT and the difficulty in accurate interpretation of a prostate biopsy following RT are discussed separately.

Conventional schedules for RT using highly conformal techniques use a daily dose of 1.8 to 2 Gy for 38 to 45 fractions. Multiple trials have examined the importance of dose and confirmed the added benefit of dose escalation in preventing biochemical failure after definitive therapy.</p><p>The most comprehensive data on the impact of dose come from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0126 trial, in which 1499 eligible patients with localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with either 79.2 Gy in 44 fractions or 70.2 Gy in 39 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. With a median follow-up of seven years, the 10-year biochemical failure rates using Phoenix criteria were 26 and 43 percent for the 79.2 Gy and 70.2 Gy regimens, respectively. The 10-year local progression rates were 4 versus 8 percent, respectively, and the 10-year distant metastasis rates were 5 versus 8 percent, respectively. However, there were no statistically significant differences in overall survival (10-year overall survival 67 versus 66 percent). The higher doses of RT were associated with an increased incidence of late toxicity.</p><p>Newer techniques (intensity-modulated RT [IMRT], image-guided RT [IGRT], proton beam irradiation, combining external beam RT with brachytherapy) have allowed further dose escalation, and doses greater than 81 Gy can be safely administered to the prostate gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Although the results varied from study to study, the authors concluded that there was a small increase in the risk of both bladder cancer and rectal cancer in patients treated with external beam RT when compared with prostate cancer patients not receiving radiation. However, these differences were not consistently present in studies comparing the cancer incidence to the general population. In addition, since most of these studies use surgically treated patients as a control group to patients treated with external beam RT, but patients treated with a radical prostatectomy have a hazard ratio of 0.45 for second cancers, this may lead to gross over estimation of the true risk of RT-induced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. &#160; </p><p>The systemic review found significant heterogeneity between different reports, and the interpretation of the data was complicated by a number of factors, including the use of older RT techniques with larger treatment fields in many series, the variable duration of follow-up, and the use of different comparators (general population versus prostate cancer patients not treated with RT).</p><p>The risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms was analyzed in a retrospective analysis of 10,924 patients treated for prostate cancer between 1986 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Therapy consisted of external beam RT, brachytherapy, or radical prostatectomy in 2183 (20 percent), 2936 (27 percent), and 5805 (53 percent) cases, respectively. Myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed in 31 cases; there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups nor was there an increased incidence compared with population-based registries.

The choice of external beam RT is largely a matter of patient preference. There are few randomized trials that compare RT with radical prostatectomy; however, a 2015 review and the results of the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial suggest that 10-year cause-specific survival rates are comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-beam-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/1,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,99</a>]. Long-term outcomes with contemporary external beam RT techniques that use high radiation doses and conformal treatment planning, as well as neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for those with higher-risk disease, appear similar to those with surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer#H834319\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anatomic extent of disease, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and biopsy Gleason grade are used for risk stratification. Patients with low-risk disease can be treated with external beam RT alone, while those at higher risk of recurrence may benefit from the addition of ADT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer#H834319\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients choosing external beam RT, treatment should be administered with a contemporary, three-dimensional conformal technique. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of proton beam irradiation over contemporary photon techniques. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'External beam RT techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is available, we suggest its use, particularly in men in whom pelvic nodal irradiation is being considered (ie, those with a predicted risk of pelvic nodal metastases of 15 percent or higher) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Retrospective analyses do not provide evidence that proton beam therapy is either more effective or less toxic than photon therapy alone. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intensity-modulated RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When available, we suggest image-guided RT (IGRT) for daily localization of the prostate prior to each treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Image-guided RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An adequate dose of radiation is necessary for optimal tumor control. We prefer a dose of 74 Gy or higher given using conventional fractionation (1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction). For patients in whom costs and convenience are important considerations, hypofractionation (eg, 60 Gy in 20 fractions) is an appropriate alternative. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dose and schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of external beam RT is assessed using the Phoenix criteria, which define biochemical recurrence as a rise in the serum PSA of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or more above the nadir, regardless of whether or not a patient receives ADT. The date of failure is defined by the time the rise in the PSA by &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is noted. (See <a href=\"#H3124870\" class=\"local\">'Definition of biochemical recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most frequent complications due to external beam RT are gastrointestinal (radiation proctitis and enteritis), urinary (frequency, dysuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urgency due to cystitis, urethritis), and sexual dysfunction.
