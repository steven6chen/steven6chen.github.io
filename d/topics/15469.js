STIs are frequently asymptomatic and can lead to various complications. The immediate goal of screening for STIs is to identify and treat infected persons before they develop complications and to identify, test, and treat their sex partners to prevent transmission and reinfections.</p><p>In this topic, we discuss screening for STIs among asymptomatic individuals. In its 2015 guidelines on the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also made recommendations on screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has also released guidelines on screening for various STIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America's HIV Medical Association has published STI screening recommendations for HIV-infected persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The recommendations in this topic are largely consistent with these guidelines. Other subspecialty group guidelines and national guidelines may be more pertinent in certain settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>The approaches to patients with specific genitourinary symptoms and signs are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with genital ulcers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Information on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of specific STIs are reviewed in detail separately (see related topics). Sexually transmitted infections and HIV infection in adolescents are also discussed separately.

The approach to STI diagnosis and management is based upon disease or symptom-specific syndromes, including vaginal discharge, urethral discharge, ulcerative genital disease, nonulcerative genital disease, and pelvic pain. However, many patients have asymptomatic disease, which increases the risk of complications and sustained transmission in the community. Thus, screening is an important approach to identify and treat infected individuals, who would otherwise go undetected. Routine screening for all potential STIs in all patients is cost-prohibitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; targeted screening of asymptomatic patients in specified risk groups is more feasible.</p><p>There is little direct evidence supporting the efficacy of screening programs. Screening for chlamydia has been the most extensively studied. The drawbacks to screening pertain largely to expense of the tests, the infrastructure required to administer them, and the psychological and relationship repercussions of false positive tests, which do occur, particularly among low prevalence populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88323163\"><span class=\"h2\">Chlamydia and gonorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria&nbsp;gonorrhoeae</em> are very common. In the United States, they are the two most commonly reported communicable diseases. In females, the primary benefit of screening and treatment is to reduce their personal risk of reproductive sequelae. In males, who have a lower risk of long-term sequelae or more frequently have symptomatic disease, the main rationale for screening and treatment would be to reduce the likelihood of reinfection of sex partners and reduce overall transmission of these infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88324495\"><span class=\"h3\">Females</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among women, most chlamydial and gonococcal infections are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and if left untreated, can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, complications of pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H22688563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Clinical syndromes in women'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H790870927\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Urogenital infection in women'</a>.)</p><p>Because the incidence of these infections are highest among adolescents and young adults, screening efforts have focused on this age group. Some proponents have argued that school-based health centers should implement systematic screening programs in adolescents to target these high-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For older women, decisions on screening are based on the presence of personal behavioral risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H52242144\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Several trials have suggested that screening young women for chlamydia reduces the rate of subsequent PID, although some limitations reduce certainty about the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. As an example, in a trial of female college students in London, all participants provided vaginal swabs at study entry and were then randomly assigned to screening (in which the samples were tested for chlamydia and those with positive tests were treated) or control (in which the samples were stored and analyzed at the end of the study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. Among those with chlamydia at baseline, 1 of 63 in the intervention group versus 7 of 74 in the control group developed PID (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03- 1.01). However, 30 of the 38 cases of PID observed in the study occurred in participants with negative baseline chlamydia, and 10 of those cases were documented to be associated with chlamydia. These findings indicate the importance of ongoing chlamydial transmission and the need for repeated screening over time in at-risk individuals.</p><p>Data on the effect of screening on prevalence of chlamydia are less clear. In one study of women and men ages 16 to 29 years in the Netherlands who were offered yearly home-based chlamydia screening tests for three years, participation was low (10 to 16 percent), and there was no evidence of reduced chlamydia rates after three rounds of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Effects on population prevalences could not be reliably estimated because of low uptake.</p><p>Although rectal chlamydial infections in women have been increasingly recognized, the adverse consequences of undetected, untreated infection at this site are unknown, and thus these are not generally screened for. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H320339991\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Extragenital infections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88324501\"><span class=\"h3\">Males</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major rationale for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening among men is to reduce infection or reinfection of existing partners and transmission to new partners. For men who have sex with only women, it is unclear if this would be of additive benefit over screening women and treating them and their sex partners. Screening is thus more relevant among men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom there is a high burden of STIs, which would be less likely impacted by screening efforts among women.</p><p>MSM are at high risk of STIs, in part, because of individual behavioral risk, but also because of other factors, such as a higher prevalence of these infections within MSM sexual networks. In the United States, the median prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea among MSM seen at STI clinics throughout the country is approximately 16 and 19 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Prevalence is even higher among HIV-infected MSM. Although there are few data to show that these screening tests improve outcomes, it is reasonable to perform screening on at least an annual basis given the high prevalence rates of these STIs in MSM and the higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among gonococcal isolates in this population. MSM with high-risk behaviors should be screened every three months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections#H7889004\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of uncomplicated Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic resistance'</a>.) </p><p>Evaluation for infection at non-genital sites is also important in this population. Several studies have reported that a significant proportion of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases would be missed if genital-only screening were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. For example, over a seven-year period, 7333 MSM attending a STI clinic in the United States underwent culture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> NAAT sampling of multiple sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The study demonstrated that one-third of the total number of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> cases would have been missed if only urethral or urine samples were tested. Similar findings have been reported in HIV-infected MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It has also been suggested that the acquisition of drug resistance mainly takes place at extragenital sites, such as the throat, where horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants is more likely to occur than in the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>For men who have sex with only women, there is little rationale for routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Evidence to support routine screening of chlamydia in men is lacking. Although screening and treating asymptomatic men for STI can reduce the burden of infection and thus transmission, it is unclear if this would be of additive benefit over screening women and treating them and their sex partners. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to screen heterosexual men for chlamydia in high prevalence settings (eg, at STI or adolescent clinics and correctional facilities) if resources allow and screening programs for men would not negatively impact those for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Among asymptomatic heterosexual men, gonorrhea prevalence is low (0 to 1.5 percent), in contrast to rates as high as 28 percent among symptomatic men in some settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Focusing on treating symptomatic men would thus likely address a significant proportion of the gonococcal burden among heterosexual men, and screening asymptomatic men may not add substantial value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88323746\"><span class=\"h2\">Trichomonas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Trichomonas</em>&nbsp;<em>vaginalis</em> infection is often asymptomatic, has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and, among HIV-infected women, an increased risk of PID. Some studies have suggested that vaginal trichomoniasis is also a risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The prevalence of trichomoniasis appears to increase with increasing age and is up to twice as high in HIV-infected women. There are currently no recommendations to routinely screen for trichomoniasis in HIV-uninfected women because the value of screening in reducing complications in non-HIV-infected reproductive-aged women is not well established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88323184\"><span class=\"h2\">Syphilis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syphilis can lead to serious long-term sequelae, including cardiac and neurologic manifestations, which are prevented by treatment in the early stages of disease, which can be minimally symptomatic or easily left undiagnosed. Screening and treatment can also reduce transmission of infection. Additionally, syphilis is associated with an increased risk for HIV transmission and acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>Although syphilis is not as common as chlamydia or gonorrhea, the prevalence can be high among certain risk groups. As an example, in the United States, the majority of all primary and secondary syphilis cases occur among MSM, many of whom are HIV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, the USPSTF recommends routine screening of asymptomatic persons who are at increased risk of syphilis, in particular MSM and HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

One reason for this omission may be related to provider comfort with this part of the patient interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Suggestions for open-ended, non-judgmental questions, as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are found in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61677 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602294876\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening recommendations vary by gender, age, and sexual behavior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103391 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88324090\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend screening for HIV infection in all adults and adolescents aged 13 to 75 years. All individuals who seek screening or testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should receive testing and counseling for HIV infection. This provides an opportunity for risk reduction education, as well as diagnosis of HIV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although all sexually active individuals are at some risk of STIs, screening for all STIs in all patients is not practical. Thus, screening for STIs focuses on those who are at high risk. For some STIs, this is done by targeting specific risk groups that have a high prevalence for STIs (eg, females &lt;25 years old, men who have sex with men [MSM], HIV-infected patients, and individuals entering into correctional facilities). In other cases, screening is dependent on assessment of an individual's personal risk based on behavioral factors. Clinicians should also consider the characteristics of the communities they serve when determining appropriate screening strategies for their particular patient population. Local public health authorities can be a source of valuable information regarding local patterns of infection and disease prevalence. (See <a href=\"#H602295897\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal interval for screening of STIs is uncertain. For individuals with prior negative screening tests, the interval for re-evaluation will be influenced by persistence or change in risk factor profile. Positive screening tests are a marker for risk and warrant more frequent testing. (See <a href=\"#H298797387\" class=\"local\">'Rescreening and retesting'</a> below.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All individuals whose sex partners had been diagnosed with an STI should undergo testing or presumptive treatment for that STI.

Many patients have asymptomatic disease, and screening for infection is thus an important approach to identify and treat infected individuals who would otherwise go undetected. (See <a href=\"#H1120616292\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although all sexually active individuals are at some risk of STIs, screening for all STIs in all patients is not practical. Thus, screening for STIs focuses on those who are at high risk. For some STIs, this is done by targeting specific risk groups that have a high prevalence for STIs (eg, females &lt;25 years old, men who have sex with men [MSM], HIV-infected patients, and individuals entering into correctional facilities). In other cases, screening is dependent on assessment of an individual's personal risk based on behavioral factors or the prevalence of infection in the local community. (See <a href=\"#H88324090\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our screening recommendations are generally consistent with those of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (See <a href=\"#H602294876\" class=\"local\">'Screening recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We screen all HIV-uninfected adults and adolescents at least once for HIV infection. In addition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103391 \">table 2</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all sexually active females &lt;25 years old, we screen for chlamydia and gonorrhea annually. Screening for syphilis, <em>Trichomonas</em>, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is reserved for those with other risk factors, as delineated for older women. (See <a href=\"#H1690631\" class=\"local\">'Younger than 25 years'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women &ge;25 years old who have risk factors for STIs (eg, new or multiple sex partners, recent STI diagnosis, exchanging sex for money or drugs), we screen for genital chlamydia and gonorrhea, syphilis, <em>Trichomonas</em> (in settings where the prevalence is high), and HBV infection (if unvaccinated or of unknown status, with plans to vaccinate if susceptible). HCV screening is performed for those who have a sex partner with chronic HCV infection. (See <a href=\"#H1690638\" class=\"local\">'25 years and older'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For men who have sex exclusively with women, we do not routinely screen heterosexual men for STIs unless they have a history of STI or are seeking STI evaluation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For MSM, we screen at least annually for syphilis, genital chlamydia and gonorrhea, rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea (in those who have had receptive anal intercourse in the prior year), and oropharyngeal gonorrhea (in those who have had receptive oral intercourse in the prior year). More frequent screening every three months is warranted for MSM at particularly high risk for STIs, including those with multiple or anonymous partners. We perform one-time screening for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HBV, with vaccination if susceptible, and at least one time screening for HCV. (See <a href=\"#H1690965\" class=\"local\">'Men who have sex with men'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For HIV-infected patients, we screen at the initial visit and then at least annually for chlamydia and gonorrhea, syphilis, <em>Trichomonas</em> (in women), and HCV. We perform one-time screening for HAV (in MSM, injection drug users, and patients with chronic hepatitis), and HBV, with vaccination if susceptible. (See <a href=\"#H298797772\" class=\"local\">'HIV-infected patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who request an STI evaluation often do so because of a specific exposure. In such cases, we test for the following infections: gonorrhea (at genital, and if exposed, rectal and pharyngeal sites), chlamydia (at genital and, if exposed, rectal sites), syphilis, HIV, <em>Trichomonas</em> (in women), and HSV-2 by serology. (See <a href=\"#H298795204\" class=\"local\">'Individuals seeking STI evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) focuses on detection of oncogenic HPV infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytologic abnormalities that can be caused by persistent infection. Indications for screening for cervical and anal dysplasia associated with HPV are discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H10700351\" class=\"local\">'Screening methods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive STI screening test warrants treatment of the STI, potential notification of the health department, partner notification and management, and decisions on retesting after treatment.
