However, systemic corticosteroid administration (primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>) is associated with serious adverse effects. As a result, currently available evidence suggests that the potential benefits of routine administration of postnatal corticosteroids are outweighed by its short- and long-term complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The use of postnatal corticosteroid therapy, including its complications in preterm infants for prevention or treatment BPD, will be reviewed here.

Despite numerous studies, however, it remains difficult to determine if a subset of infants exists in which the benefits of postnatal corticosteroid therapy outweigh its risks, due in part to difficulties in interpreting the data because of numerous methodologic issues.</p><p>These issues include variations in the preparation of corticosteroid used, the dosing and timing of administration, length of therapy, and the open label use of corticosteroids in patients in control groups, as well as limited data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Open label use is defined as the use of prescribed corticosteroids by clinicians, in addition to the administration of the masked study drug. As a result, patients in the placebo group sometimes received corticosteroids, thereby minimizing differences between treatment and control groups. Because of these issues, the postnatal use of either systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a controversial and continuously evolving subject.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC STEROIDS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous clinical trials have shown the beneficial pulmonary effects of postnatal systemic corticosteroids in preterm infants. Two meta-analyses have divided these trials based upon the timing of administration and their focus on either prevention or treatment of established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Dexamethasone</a> has been the corticosteroid used in most of the studies, including those reviewed in the meta-analyses.</p><p>The first meta-analysis included trials that administered corticosteroid therapy up to and including seven days of age to preterm infants at risk for BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Results showed that postnatal corticosteroid therapy compared with placebo was associated with earlier extubation and decreased incidence of BPD both at 28 days and 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). There were no differences in mortality or in the proportion of survivors discharged home on oxygen.</p><p>The second meta-analysis included trials that administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> to infants with evolving or established chronic lung disease who were greater than seven days of age. Results showed that postnatal corticosteroid therapy compared with placebo improved survival at 28 days of age, but not at time of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, late administration of corticosteroid therapy was associated with a lower extubation failure rate, incidence of BPD at 28 days and 36 weeks PMA, and discharge on home oxygen.</p><p>Although these reviews demonstrated the benefits of postnatal systemic corticosteroids in reducing the incidence of BPD at 28 and 36 weeks PMA and increasing the likelihood of earlier extubation, corticosteroid therapy was associated with significant short- and long-term complications regardless of the timing of its administration. Early corticosteroid administration was associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy (CP) and abnormal neurologic examination at long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The follow-up studies may not be definitive, however, because of limitations in the methodologic quality of some of them. These meta-analyses concluded that the potential benefit of routine postnatal corticosteroid therapy in either prevention or treatment of established BPD may not outweigh its known adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

However, interest in prophylactic use of hydrocortisone had been limited because of the early termination of a multicenter trial due to concerns of associated increased risk of spontaneous intestinal perforation in the treatment group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The treatment group was assigned to a course of intravenous low-dose hydrocortisone within the first 10 days after delivery of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (divided into two doses) for the first seven days followed by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for three days as a single dose. The number of patients needed to treat to gain one BPD-free survival was 12 (95% CI, 6-200). There was no difference in the rate of adverse events for the entire cohort, including gastrointestinal perforation and sepsis, although subgroup analyses showed a higher rate of late-onset sepsis in the hydrocortisone-treated infants born at 24 to 25 weeks GA compared with gestational-matched controls (40 versus 23 percent). Of note, this study was also terminated early because of limitations in funding. The study included 523 patients with a predetermined sample size of 786 infants based on an expected survival rate without BPD of 56 percent for controls and 66 percent for the treatment group. A follow-up study at a median corrected age of 22 months reported no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients assigned to hydrocortisone and controls had similar rates of no neurodevelopmental impairment (73 versus 70 percent), mild neurodevelopmental impairment (20 versus 18 percent), moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment (7 versus 11 percent), and cerebral palsy (6 versus 5 percent).

We do not administer systematic steroids concurrently, and we do not recommend chronic use of inhaled steroids in BPD patients (with the exception of older infants who develop the typical course of asthma).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremely low gestational age infants (gestational age less than 28 weeks) are at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64789 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal corticosteroid therapy administered systemically has been shown to improve the pulmonary outcome of infants with established BPD and prevent BPD in high-risk preterm infants. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic corticosteroid therapy has significant adverse effects during its administration, which include hyperglycemia, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Short-term adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal systemic corticosteroid therapy, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>, increases the risk of cerebral palsy in preterm infants. It is unclear whether systemic corticosteroid therapy is associated with other significant long-term neurologic disabilities, such as decreased cognitive function, because the limited available data are inconsistent. In addition, specific corticosteroids (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> and dexamethasone) differ in their long-term adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled corticosteroids may provide some short-term pulmonary benefit while avoiding the adverse effects of systemic administration. However, whether postnatal administration of inhaled corticosteroids (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a>) prevents BPD without increasing undesirable outcomes including mortality requires further study. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled corticosteroid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, the approach is consistent with the revised 2010 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published guidelines in the use of postnatal corticosteroid therapy for BPD as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> using postnatal systemic corticosteroid therapy to prevent BPD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The early routine use of systemic corticosteroids to prevent BPD unnecessarily exposes a large number of preterm infants, who would not develop BPD, to potential short-term and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Systemic steroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most preterm infants with established BPD, we recommend <strong>not</strong> <strong>routinely </strong>treating infants with BPD with postnatal systemic corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Based upon current data, the potential benefit of corticosteroid therapy is not justified because of its known short- and long-term adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Systemic steroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In our practice, we consider the use of systemic corticosteroid therapy in infants with severe BPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64789 \">table 1</a>) who require substantial persistent ventilatory and oxygen support. Under these circumstances, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hydrocortisone versus dexamethasone'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> using inhaled corticosteroids to prevent BPD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In our practice, we use inhaled steroids only in selected infants with severe BPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64789 \">table 1</a>) who are dependent upon substantial pulmonary support (eg, mechanical ventilation and high concentrations of supplemental oxygen).
