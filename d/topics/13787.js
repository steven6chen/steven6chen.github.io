(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When administered according to an alternative or abbreviated schedule, PCV is most effective if at least one dose is administered at &ge;12 months of age. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Alternative or abbreviated schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend universal immunization of infants and children younger than 60 months with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine-13-valent-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</a> (PCV13) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also recommend immunization with PCV13 for incompletely immunized children younger than 72 months who are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68655 \">table 3</a>) and children 72 months through 18 years who have anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other immunocompromising condition, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leak (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first three doses of PCV13 should be administered at two, four, and six months of age; the fourth dose should be administered at 12 to 15 months of age, but at least eight weeks after the third dose. PCV13 is administered intramuscularly (IM) as a single 0.5 mL dose. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Routine schedule'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Dose and route'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The schedule for children in high-risk groups also includes the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62519\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62519 \">table 4</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Catch-up schedule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common reactions following PCV13 in infants are moderate local reactions and fever. Rare but serious adverse events include seizures, anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions, serum sickness, and thrombocytopenia.
