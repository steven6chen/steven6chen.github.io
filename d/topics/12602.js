Although true and complete replacement of renal function is not provided by dialysis, this modality removes metabolic wastes and excess body water and replenishes body buffers in order to sustain life.</p><p>The apparatus used to conduct hemodialysis consists of the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialyzer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis solution (dialysate)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubing for transport of blood and dialysis solution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Machine to power and mechanically monitor the procedure</p><p/><p>Dialyzers are composed of a polyurethane capsule or shell within which hollow fibers or parallel membrane plates are suspended in dialysate. The fibers or plates function as a semipermeable membrane across which blood and dialysate flow. By crossing this membrane, solutes and water move between a patient's intravascular compartment and the dialysis fluid contained within the dialyzer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51887 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the hemodialysis apparatus.</p><p>Prior to discussing the different aspects of this modality, it is helpful to briefly review the principles underlying solute removal in hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SOLUTE CLEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solute is cleared from the intravascular compartment by either diffusive or convective transport. Such transport depends upon multiple factors including the concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate for a particular solute, the type and amount of blood and dialysate flow, the properties of the dialysis membrane, and the size and physicochemical property of the solute being removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffusive transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffusive transport is the primary means of metabolic waste removal in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Such transport depends upon the interface of blood from the patient with dialysate fluid, which occurs via pores located within each fiber of the dialysis membrane. Diffusive transport occurs when blood flowing within each hollow fiber meets dialysate fluid bathing the fibers. Diffusion of solutes proceeds down a concentration gradient from blood to dialysate or from dialysate to blood (bidirectional).</p><p>The degree of diffusive transport is a function of the concentration difference of the solute with respect to blood and dialysate, membrane surface area, porosity and thickness of the membrane, molecular size of the solute, and flow rate of blood and dialysate. The mass transfer coefficient (KoA) of a dialyzer (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clearance'</a> below), which defines its capacity, varies with the depth and porosity of the membrane, the molecular size of a given solute, and the flow rates of blood and dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Blood and dialysate flow in <strong>opposite</strong> directions through the dialyzer with dialysate flow rates generally set at 1.5 to 2 times the blood flow rates, equating to rates of 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and 500 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for blood and dialysate flow rates, respectively. Such countercurrent flow is integral to maximizing the diffusive clearance of metabolic waste solutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51887 \">figure 1</a>). If blood and dialysate flow in the same direction across the dialysis membrane (concurrent flow), the diffusion of a solute will lower the concentration of the substance in the blood and raise it in the dialysate, thereby gradually decreasing and perhaps even abolishing the concentration gradient that would otherwise favor further diffusion. This effect is minimized with countercurrent flow. In this arrangement, the concentration of solute in the dialysate is lowest when it enters the dialyzer at the blood (venous) outflow (where the solute blood concentration is at its minimum) and is highest when it leaves the dialyzer at the blood (arterial) inflow (where the solute blood concentration is at its maximum). As a result, a high concentration gradient is maintained for the length of the fluid paths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Convective transport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With high rates of fluid transport (ie, ultrafiltration) from blood to dialysate, convective transport of solute also occurs, thereby augmenting diffusive solute transport. In this mechanism, solutes are effectively dragged along with the fluid as it moves across the membrane, depending upon their size relative to the size of the membrane pores.</p><p>The propensity for impedance of any solute is described by the sieving coefficient, a numerical assessment of the potential for convective transport of a given solute. This coefficient equals the ratio of the solute concentration in the filtrate to that in the arterial plasma. A sieving coefficient of 1 denotes a solute which passes completely unimpeded, whereas a solute that is completely rejected has a coefficient of 0. Very large and small solutes therefore have sieving coefficients approximating 0 and 1, respectively. For small solutes, such as urea, glucose, and electrolytes, the solute concentration in the fluid removed by convective transport is similar to that in the plasma. Since the capacity for small-solute diffusion is generally much greater than that for large-solute diffusion (eg, vitamin B12), the relative contribution of convection may be most important in large-solute transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>These relationships apply to conventional hemodialysis. A different process of solute removal is used with venovenous hemofiltration, in which very large volumes of water and solutes are removed by convection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clearance of solutes, either via diffusion or convective transport, is influenced by blood and dialysate flow rates. Increases in clearance occur with increases in flow rates until a plateau is reached; beyond this threshold, no further increases occur with increasing flow. The flow dependence of diffusive transport is greatest for small solutes (eg, urea and electrolytes). These solutes are rapidly cleared, thereby diminishing the concentration gradient for further diffusion. Providing fresh plasma (with a high-solute concentration) and fresh dialysate (with a low-solute concentration) maximizes solute removal.</p><p>Small-solute clearances reach a plateau at higher flow rates than large solutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since larger solutes diffuse more slowly, the concentration gradient is maintained, and it is the duration of dialysis that is a major determinant of solute removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID REMOVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid removal occurs via a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the membrane, which is generated by the dialysis machine. This transmembrane pressure (TMP) causes fluid to cross from the side of high pressure (blood compartment) to the side of low pressure (dialysate compartment), thereby allowing fluid removal from the patient. This filtering of cell-free fluid from the blood compartment to the dialysate compartment is called ultrafiltration. Permeability is a function of thickness and pore size and varies with dialyzer make and model.</p><p>Positive pressurization of the blood compartment coupled with negative pressure (applied) suction to the dialysate compartment establishes TMP. The TMP is set for each patient at each dialysis treatment so that fluid can be removed at a desired volume over a designated time. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Ultrafiltration coefficient'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYZERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal types of dialyzers used are hollow fiber (or capillary) and parallel plate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hollow-fiber dialyzers &ndash; Hollow fibers are the most common dialyzers in current use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They contain thousands of hollow fibers each similar in structure to a human capillary; as a result, the term &quot;capillary&quot; is often used in lieu of hollow fiber to describe this dialyzer. Porous, capillary-like fibers carrying blood are bundled together within the dialyzer shell and serve collectively as the dialyzer membrane across which blood and dialysate flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parallel-plate dialyzers &ndash; Parallel-plate dialyzers operate similarly to the hollow-fiber type of dialyzer but are fashioned with flat sheets of membrane material arranged in parallel. With each membrane sheet laid on top of another, blood and dialysate flow in parallel but through separate spaces between membrane sheets. Blood and dialysate exchange occurs across pores within each membrane sheet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

It is composed of chains of glucosan rings with abundant free-hydroxyl groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substituted cellulose membranes are obtained by chemical bonding of a material to the free-hydroxyl groups at the surface of the cellulose polymer. The most common type is cellulose acetate, in which acetate replaces 80 percent of the hydroxyl groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellulosynthetic membranes are modified by the addition of a synthetic material (such as diethylaminoethyl in the production of Hemophane) to liquefied cellulose during its formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, synthetic noncellulose membranes have a higher permeability and are more biocompatible than the cellulose membranes. There are also some synthetic low-flow membranes. A variety of synthetic membranes are available including polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polysulfone, polycarbonate, polyamide, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membranes.</p><p/><p>Comparative benefits relating to permeability and biocompatibility have only been well studied with synthetic noncellulose and cellulose membranes. The properties of substituted cellulose and cellulosynthetic membranes are less amenable to generalization. As an example, cellulose triacetate is highly permeable and relatively highly biocompatible, while Hemophane and polysulfone are relatively biocompatible. Concerns related to lower permeability and bioincompatibility of cellulose membranes have effectively driven these products from the North American market, leaving substituted cellulose and synthetic cellulose and noncellulose membranes as the dominant membranes.</p><p>Biocompatibility with blood is an important property inherent to and variable with the type of dialyzer membrane. The potential for adverse inflammatory reaction between blood and membrane-activated complement and cytokine release is thought to be less pronounced with the more biocompatible synthetic membranes.</p><p>It is not clear whether long-term use of biocompatible membranes is associated with better quality of life <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improved survivals when compared with bioincompatible membranes. With some clinical outcomes, there is supportive evidence that biocompatibility is important, particularly for acute kidney injury (AKI). The only controlled trial done in dialysis patients, the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, did not find any benefits with biocompatible versus bioincompatible membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The impact of dialyzer type on outcomes was evaluated in a large cohort study using data from a nationwide Japanese registry of hemodialysis patients on dialysis for at least two years. Compared with polysulfone, all-cause mortality at two years was best with polyethersulfone and polymethylmethacrylate and worst with cellulose triacetate, ethylene vinyl alcohol, polyacrylonitrile, and polyester polymer alloy. Additional study is needed to assess the potential for improving prognosis with dialyzer type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In addition, unlike some parallel-plate dialyzers, the blood volume capacity of hollow-fiber dialyzers is essentially fixed and will not increase with increasing transmembrane pressure (TMP). Priming volume depends upon dialyzer surface area and ranges from 60 to 120 mL, excluding priming volume of blood lines, which adds between 100 and 150 mL. The total priming volume therefore ranges from 160 to 270 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Lower priming volumes are desirable to minimize the risk of hemodynamic compromise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Surface area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialyzers with larger surface areas normally have high urea clearances; however, the efficiency of the dialyzer, as described by the mass transfer coefficient (KoA) (see next section), is most integral to achieving optimal urea clearance, independent of a dialyzer's surface area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clearance of various solutes from blood is a function of dialyzer efficiency. Dialyzer clearances are routinely reported as urea or creatinine clearances (small solutes) as well as vitamin B12 (large solute) clearances. The reported clearance of urea by the manufacturer, although most commonly higher than that observed with actual dialysis, may be used to compare different dialysis membranes. The clearance of urea is usually reported as that observed at blood flows of 200, 300, and 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p>KoA, the quantitative measure of a particular dialyzer's efficiency of clearance, is defined by membrane porosity and thickness, solute size, and flow rate of blood and dialysate. The KoA for urea generally varies from 200 to 1100 among the various different dialyzers available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The KoA for a particular dialyzer should be the measurement observed at a blood flow rate of 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Some investigators suggest that this measure can be utilized to help guide the initial choice of dialyzer in certain clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small patients and those undergoing dialysis for AKI (in which gradual solute removal is initially desirable) may be treated with a dialyzer with a KoA &lt;300, with later advancement to a more efficient dialyzer.

The volume of fluid (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span> that is transferred across the membrane per mmHg of pressure gradient is called the ultrafiltration coefficient (KUf) and is a measure of a dialyzer's permeability relative to water.</p><p>A low KUf denotes a low permeability to water. The lower the permeability to water, the higher the TMP needed to achieve ultrafiltration. Conversely, dialyzers with higher KUf specifications achieve desired ultrafiltration volumes with lower TMPs, requiring cautious and meticulous setting of the TMP to avoid excessive volume losses.</p><p>However, newer machines with controlled ultrafiltration have eliminated the need to calculate the required TMP. As a result, such machines require only that desired fluid loss for the treatment be entered into the machine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Sterilization and reuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most dialyzers are sterilized by the manufacturer with ethylene oxide.

The use of carbon tanks to prevent chloramine exposure is essential. The presence of methemoglobinemia was reported in critical care patients being dialyzed by portable dialysis machines. Inadequate clearance of chloramine from municipal tap water was cited as the causal factor, prompting the use of larger-capacity carbon filters.

This is largely due to the association of acetate with cardiovascular instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>). In many machines, the bicarbonate concentration can be varied from 35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> as dictated by individual patient lab values. The buffering capacity of the various available bicarbonate products is not identical, and, while all bicarbonate-based dialysis products deliver additional buffer, the&nbsp;desired amount of total buffer delivered should be assessed in the context of the individual patient. Historically, bicarbonate has been supplied from a central delivery source; some newer machines are equipped with their own source of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> in the form of a powder that is automatically mixed with water to produce a saturated solution, which is proportioned with water and acid to achieve the prescribed dialysate for a given patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Hypercalcemia has become more frequent with the combined use of oral calcium salts for phosphorus binding and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) to suppress hyperparathyroidism. As a result, a calcium concentration of 2.5 or 2.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> has replaced the 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> concentration as the standard dialysate in most hemodialysis units (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>). In one observational, retrospective study, lower-dialysate calcium concentrations (&lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> were associated with greater rate of hospitalizations for congestive heart failure, as well as more hypocalcemia, and intradialytic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although dialysis facility conversion from 2.5 to a lower-dialysate calcium concentration was associated with more hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperparathyroidism, as well as increased use of phosphate binders, vitamin D, and calcimimetics, there was no increase in all-cause mortality or overall hospitalization rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Ongoing study of the most appropriate dialysate calcium concentration is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS TUBING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inlets for inflowing (undialyzed) blood and fresh dialysate are present in the dialyzer capsule, as well as outlets for outflowing (dialyzed) blood and spent dialysate (dialysis effluent). Synthetic tubing designated as the &quot;arterial&quot; line carries blood from the arteriovenous access to the dialyzer, where blood and dialysate interface at the membrane. A &quot;venous&quot; line simultaneously carries dialyzed blood back to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51887\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51887 \">figure 1</a>). Specialized tubing is now available to facilitate assessment of dialysis access flow in real time while dialysis is ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS MACHINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A machine to empower and monitor the safety of hemodialysis must include a blood pump to move blood between patient and the dialyzer, a delivery system to transport dialysis solution, and monitoring devices. Pressure monitors, located proximal to the blood pump and distal to the dialyzer, guard against excessive suction of blood from, and excessive resistance to blood return to, the patient's vascular access site. The presence of abnormal pressure measurements may suggest stenoses within the arteriovenous access utilized for chronic dialysis; although imperfect, consistently abnormal findings may suggest the need for additional studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corrective measures.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialyzers are composed of a polyurethane capsule or shell, within which hollow fibers or parallel membrane plates are suspended in dialysate. The fibers or plates function as a semipermeable membrane across which blood and dialysate flow in opposite directions. Hollow fibers are the most common dialyzers in use. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dialyzers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialyzer membranes include unmodified cellulose (also called cuprophan or cuprophane), substituted cellulose, cellulosynthetic, and synthetic noncellulose. Synthetic noncellulose membranes are more biocompatible than the cellulose membranes and include polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polysulfone, polycarbonate, polyamide, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membranes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Type of membrane material'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearance of various solutes from blood is a function of dialyzer efficiency. Dialyzer clearances are routinely reported as urea or creatinine clearances (reflecting small-solute clearance) and vitamin B12 clearance (reflecting large-solute clearance). The reported clearance of urea may be used to compare different dialysis membranes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mass transfer coefficient (KoA) is the quantitative measure of a dialyzer's efficiency and is defined by membrane porosity and thickness, solute size, and flow rate of blood and dialysate. The KoA for urea varies from 200 to 1100: Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis therapy are usually treated with a dialyzer with a KoA between 300 and 600. Individuals requiring high-efficiency dialysis may be treated with dialyzers with KoAs &gt;600. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of fluid (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span> that is transferred across the membrane per mmHg of pressure gradient is called the ultrafiltration coefficient (KUf) and is a measure of a dialyzer's permeability relative to water. The KUf of a dialyzer correlates directly with its permeability. The lower the permeability to water, the higher the transmembrane pressure (TMP) needed to achieve ultrafiltration. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Ultrafiltration coefficient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis machines mix different components with water to produce the final solution of dialysate. Potential contaminants in water include aluminum, copper or chloramine, bacteria, and endotoxin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammatory cytokines. To help eliminate these and other contaminants, water is treated with a combination of various different purification methods, including reverse osmosis, deionization resins, and activated charcoal. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Water'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical hemodialysate contains sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and glucose. Bicarbonate has replaced acetate as the typical source of buffer in dialysis solution. The buffering capacity of the various available bicarbonate products is not identical, and, while all bicarbonate-based dialysis products deliver additional buffer, the&nbsp;desired amount of total buffer delivered should be assessed in the context of the individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Components of the dialysate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A calcium concentration of 2.5 or 2.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> has replaced the 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> concentration as the standard dialysate in most hemodialysis units. The appropriate dialysate sodium concentration likely varies between patients and warrants an individualized approach, particularly in those with large interdialytic weight gains. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Components of the dialysate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis tubing consists of synthetic tubing designated as the &quot;arterial&quot; line, which carries blood from the arteriovenous access to the dialyzer, where blood and dialysate interface at the membrane, and the &quot;venous&quot; line, which carries dialyzed blood back to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis tubing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dialysis machine must include a blood pump to move blood between patient and the dialyzer, a delivery system to transport dialysis solution, and monitoring devices. Monitoring devices include pressure monitors that detect excessive suction or resistance of blood flow, a venous air trap and air detector that prevents air from being returned to the patient, continuous measurement devices that monitor solute concentrate, dialysate temperature monitors, and a dialysate urea monitor.
