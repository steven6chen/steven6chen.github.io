A significant breakthrough occurred with the identification of near-universal expression of the CD117 antigen by these tumors (now called gastrointestinal stromal tumors [GISTs]). The other group of spindle cell neoplasms arising in the GI tract (which are analogous to soft tissue tumors throughout the rest of the body and include lipomas, schwannomas, hemangiomas, usual leiomyomas and the malignant counterpart, leiomyosarcomas) is typically CD117-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The CD117 molecule is part of the KIT (c-kit) receptor, a membrane tyrosine kinase (TK) that is a product of the <em>KIT </em>protooncogene. In 80 percent of cases, <em>KIT</em> overexpression is the result of an activating mutation in the <em>KIT</em> protooncogene. Although the majority of GISTs are <em>KIT</em> positive, some <em>KIT</em> negative GISTs have activating mutations in a related TK receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<em>PDGFRA</em>). The current view is that the overwhelming majority of GI tract mesenchymal tumors fall into the GIST category; they are identifiable by KIT immunoreactivity or the presence of activating mutations in <em>KIT</em> or <em>PDGFRA</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, clinical presentation, prognostic features, and diagnostic work-up of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)&quot;, section on 'Classification and molecular pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the year 2000, there was no known effective therapy for unresectable or metastatic GISTs. It has long been appreciated that GI tract sarcomas have lower response rates to chemotherapy than other sites of soft tissue sarcomas, indicating a higher rate of primary resistance to chemotherapy in these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Treatment of GISTs was revolutionized by the finding that mutational activation of KIT or PDGFRA stimulated growth of these cancer cells. This led to effective systemic therapies in the form of small molecule inhibitors of the receptor TKs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> (Gleevec), the prototype drug, was originally approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a disorder in which an aberrant TK results from molecular rearrangement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It subsequently became evident that molecularly targeted therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> induced dramatic, rapid, and sustained clinical benefit in GISTs as well. These agents block signaling via KIT or PDGFRA by binding to the ATP-binding pocket required for phosphorylation and activation of the receptor. Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been identified that block several TK targets, including KIT (referred to as multitargeted TKIs). Some data suggest an anti-GIST immune response is associated with good clinical outcomes in patients with GIST on imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Here we will discuss TKI therapy for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">advanced/metastatic</span> GISTs.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning proved to be a sensitive and reliable response indicator, with markedly diminished uptake, compared with baseline studies, seen in responders as early as 24 hours after the first dose of imatinib. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessing response to therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adverse events were common but generally mild. These included grade 1 or 2 nausea or diarrhea in approximately one-half, fluid retention (predominantly periorbital) in three-fourths, muscle cramps and fatigue (40 and 35 percent, respectively), and gastrointestinal (GI) or intra-abdominal hemorrhage in 5 percent. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and their management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A sizeable subset of patients in this trial survived long-term on first-line <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. In a preliminary report of long-term follow-up of a cohort of 56 patients who continued to take imatinib beyond three years, 26 (18 percent of the initial cohort) remained on continuous imatinib since study entry at a median follow-up of 9.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The overall likelihood of remaining progression-free at nine years or beyond was dependent on tumor size at initial diagnosis and ranged from 29 percent in those with an initial tumor bulk of &lt;39.1 mm<sup>2</sup> to 3 percent in those with an initial tumor bulk &gt;262.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. The corresponding rates of overall survival were 58 and 23 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A similar fraction of patients with metastatic disease who achieved long-term disease control was reported in an analysis derived from the SWOG phase III S0033 trial, which studied two different dose levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Impact of dose'</a> below). In a preliminary report presented at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, 180 of the 695 eligible patients (26 percent) survived eight years or longer, and the estimated 10-year survival rate was 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among the 137 long-term survivors, imatinib was the sole therapy administered continuously to 49 percent, while 39 percent received subsequent systemic agents including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, the median survival of patients with advanced GIST increased from an average of 18 to 57 months in the trial with the longest follow-up to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the high efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> in most patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">metastatic/inoperable</span> GISTs, complete responses are rare overall (less than 10 percent), and most patients who initially respond eventually acquire resistance via additional mutations in <em>KIT</em>, discussed below. The median time to progression is approximately two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/8,10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,15,16</a>], although it is longer in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A subset of patients with metastatic GIST experiences durable responses and long-term survival with imatinib treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

With functional imaging such as PET, responses can be observed within 24 hours of starting therapy, although this has little practical impact on the typical patient with metastatic GIST. In addition to detecting primary <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> resistance, PET can aid in the detection of secondary resistance, as does detection of the &quot;nodule within a tumor&quot; as a sign of drug resistance. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'RECIST versus CHOI criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>If employed, a rigorous standardized approach to patient preparation and study technique is needed for reproducible results, as emphasized by consensus guidelines on use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET for response assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>The added benefit for dual modality <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging in most cases with advanced GIST is unclear, and PET scans are rarely used to assess the response to therapy in patients with advanced disease, unless in the context of a clinical trial. Newly proposed CT criteria using either no growth in tumor size or a combination of tumor density and size criteria have shown a close correlation with the predictive value results of FDG-PET, and serial CT or MRI scanning at three- to six-month intervals is more often recommended during therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cross-sectional imaging'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'RECIST versus CHOI criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>One clinical scenario where baseline and follow-up PET scan might prove useful is for a patient with a borderline resectable GIST or a potentially resectable tumor that requires extensive organ disruption who is being treated with initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>]. In these situations, early assessment of treatment response might provide an opportunity to shift to an alternative therapy (eg, resection or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>) if imatinib is ineffective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important point is that patient symptoms also improve rapidly in the setting of response, decreasing to some degree the need to obtain imaging shortly after starting neoadjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional CT scans with intravenous contrast enhancement are a good standard of care for radiographic assessment of most patients with metastatic GIST. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also provides similar information to that obtained with contrast-enhanced CT scans. </p><p>Certain finer points are worth keeping in mind based on the experience with metastatic GIST patients since the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. For example, GISTs will infrequently increase in size during early treatment as a consequence of intratumoral hemorrhage or myxoid degeneration. A decrease in tumor density as seen on CT (the corollary of decreased FDG uptake on PET, see above) is an important early clinical marker of antitumor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], as is decreased contrast uptake on standard CT or MRI scans. Once tumors become hypodense (cystic), the size of the lesions may decrease slowly and eventually stabilize.</p><p>Late responses are often seen in patients who initially have stable disease, and survival in those with stable disease parallels that of patients with an objective response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/14,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,30</a>]. The median time to achieve an objective response is four months, while maximal response may take six months or even longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>As a result of these issues, response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is frequently defined as absence of progression at the time of the first formal disease re-evaluation (typically two to three months after starting therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Clear-cut evidence of progression at this time point is considered initial (primary) resistance, while progression or relapse after a period of stable or responding disease is referred to as late (secondary) resistance. Initial resistance was seen in 12 percent of 934 patients in a randomized European trial exploring two different doses of imatinib (discussed below) and was more likely in patients with lung but not liver metastases (41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The management of patients with imatinib-refractory disease is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management of imatinib-refractory or intolerant patients'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> for advanced disease, the optimal interscan interval is not established. In keeping with guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site&amp;token=KVRKaAygvvJD1E58VlEWXz36Vm7rTFr+R9Uzv3HO05ED1Gei9+DmGHcRz0LAM8ZDYHKgb6e25tFXbwlgtK+Snb/LRLTmHDvToUPPCY3zWvc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7725\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>, we perform history and physical examination, and repeat cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen and pelvis every three to six months. For patients who have low-volume or no residual detectable metastatic disease who continue to have an excellent response to imatinib, we transition to every six months imaging after three years, and then to annual imaging after six or more years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">RECIST versus CHOI criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, radiographic response to TKIs is often indicated by an early decrease in tumor density, followed by slow tumor regression. This pattern of response is not well suited to the use of standard RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), which is based upon tumor measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Likewise, disease progression in patients with GIST may also fail to be captured by standard RECIST. Tumor progression may manifest as new or enlarging tumor masses, as partial to complete filling-in of a previously hypodense lesion, or as a hyperdense &quot;nodule-within-a-mass&quot; pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The importance of identifying this latter situation is that successful ablation of such resistant clones has been reported, with continued <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> sensitivity of areas of disease that remain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>An alternative set of response evaluation criteria has been proposed, the so-called Choi criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Investigators at MD Anderson initially showed that a 10 percent decrease in unidimensional tumor size or a 15 percent decrease in tumor density on contrast-enhanced CT scans (as reflected by differences in x-ray attenuation between a given material and water, expressed in Hounsfield units) correlates well with PET scan findings and is a better predictor of response to therapy (as judged by time to tumor progression) than standard RECIST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>These investigators compared the Choi criteria to standard (version 1.0, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74693 \">table 2</a>)) RECIST in 98 patients (40 in a training set and 58 a test set) receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> for advanced GIST who had CT scans eight weeks after starting therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The test set had 28 (48 percent) good responders by RECIST, compared with 49 (84 percent) good responders by Choi criteria. Even when the 98 patients were analyzed together, the response group by RECIST did not correlate significantly with either disease-specific survival or time to tumor progression, whereas the Choi response group did correlate with both endpoints. The authors concluded that tumor response for GIST should preferentially be categorized by the Choi rather than the RECIST.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least two randomized trials have failed to show significantly greater efficacy for higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> doses (800 versus 400 mg daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In both trials, patients with disease progression in the standard-dose arm were allowed to cross over to high-dose therapy. The European trial demonstrated a modestly but significantly higher progression-free survival (PFS) with the 800 mg dose with median 25-month follow-up, which was no longer evident with longer follow-up (median 40 months), and which did not lead to a significant improvement in overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-therapy-for-advanced-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

A prospective study of 25 patients progressing at intra-abdominal soft tissue or liver sites during or after TKI therapy demonstrated a low objective response rate to radiotherapy (only two [8 percent] achieved a partial remission), but 20 (80 percent) had stable target lesion size for three or more months (median duration of stabilization 16 months), and this was fourfold longer than the median time to GIST progression at any site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Approximately 95 percent of these tumors overexpress KIT (which can be identified by immunohistochemical staining), and 85 percent have mutations in the <em>KIT</em> protooncogene that leads to constitutive activation of KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase (TK). A subset of GISTs that lack <em>KIT</em> mutations have activating mutations in a related receptor TK, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (<em>PDGFRA</em>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with advanced unresectable GIST, we recommend an orally active TK inhibitor (TKI) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In the absence of a head-to-head comparison of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, we recommend initial treatment with imatinib 400 mg daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Treatment is associated with dramatic and sustained responses in the majority of patients. Overall, 80 percent of patients with overt metastatic disease experience an objective response or disease stability, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is 20 to 26 months. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of imatinib'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is effective in some GISTs that are characterized by alterations in <em>PDGFRA</em> and not <em>KIT</em> mutations, patients with advanced spindle cell tumors of the GI tract that appear histologically compatible with a diagnosis of GIST should not be denied a trial of imatinib, even if they are immunohistochemically KIT negative and mutation status is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Influence of mutations on response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An assessment of mutation status in individual GISTs is advised for most patients being treated for metastatic disease because of the prognostic and predictive information that can be derived from such an assessment. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> has modest activity against <em>PDGFRA</em> D842V-mutant GIST and can be tried prior to other agents. While the response rate appears low, imatinib is less toxic for the majority of patients than other TKIs. However, we do not generally offer initial imatinib treatment to patients with succinate dehydrogenase (<em>SDH)</em>-deficient tumors. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'PDGFRA D842V mutation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1822625043\" class=\"local\">'SDH-deficient tumors and those associated with NF1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal means of response assessment in patients receiving TKIs is unclear. Radiographic response is often indicated by an early decrease in tumor density on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, followed by slow tumor regression. This pattern of response is not well suited to the use of standard response criteria. Because of this, TKIs should be continued indefinitely in the absence of overt radiographic progression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessing response to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although positron emission tomography (PET) scans appear to identify a greater number of responses and at an earlier time than CT, PET is not routinely indicated for response assessment. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'PET scanning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, one clinical scenario where baseline and follow-up PET scan might prove useful is for a patient with a borderline resectable GIST or a potentially resectable tumor that requires extensive organ disruption who is being treated with initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. Early assessment of treatment response provides the opportunity to shift to an alternative therapy (eg, resection or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>) if imatinib is ineffective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of surgery in patients with locally unresectable, nonmetastatic GISTs and those with potentially resectable metastatic disease who respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is evolving. This approach has little to offer patients with extensive disease progression while receiving imatinib.

Thyroid function should be evaluated at baseline and monitored at frequent intervals during therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management of imatinib-refractory or intolerant patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative approach, increasing the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> to 800 mg daily, could be tried in patients who have clearly progressive disease while receiving 400 mg daily doses and who are tolerating the drug reasonably well. However, this approach is unlikely to benefit patients who progress rapidly (within two months) after starting therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Dose escalation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> and sunitinib-refractory GIST, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> or another TKI (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
