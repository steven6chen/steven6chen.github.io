This happens over a long period of time, often years.</p><p>Acromegaly is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63094 \">figure 1</a>). It makes many hormones, including one called &quot;growth hormone,&quot; which the body needs to grow. A tumor in the pituitary gland can cause it to release too much growth hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13657007\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acromegaly?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms involve too much growth in some parts of the body, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Face and head &ndash; The nose, lips, ears, and forehead get larger. The tongue and lower jaw also grow, and the spaces between the teeth get wider.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throat &ndash; The tissue inside the throat and around the voice box can grow bigger than normal. This can cause deepening of the voice or trouble breathing during sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hands and feet &ndash; The hands and feet become bigger and swollen. People with acromegaly usually notice that their rings and shoes become tighter. Some people develop &quot;carpal tunnel syndrome,&quot; which is a condition that causes pain or tingling in the hands and fingers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; Skin might become thicker. Some people also get small growths of extra skin, called &quot;skin tags.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bones &ndash; The ends of the bones can grow too much. This can damage the cartilage (the rubbery material that keeps bones from scraping against each other), and eventually lead to arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors &ndash; People with acromegaly have a higher risk of getting non-cancerous tumors. These can include fibroids (growths in the uterus, or womb) and colon polyps (small growths in the intestine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart &ndash; The heart muscle can grow bigger than normal, which can make it hard for the heart to work well. People with acromegaly are also more likely to have high blood pressure.</p><p/><p>If a tumor on the pituitary gland gets too big, it can press on the nerves that lead to the eyes. This sometimes causes vision problems.</p><p>Acromegaly also increases the chances that a person will get diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13657021\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for acromegaly?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Usually, a doctor or nurse suspects acromegaly based on a person's appearance. He or she can do a blood test to check if there is too much growth hormone in the blood.</p><p>If a blood test shows the person has too much growth hormone, the doctor or nurse will order an MRI. An MRI is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of your body. It can show if there is a tumor in the pituitary gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13657036\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acromegaly treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; In most cases, doctors do surgery to try to remove the tumor in the pituitary gland. An experienced surgeon makes a small cut in the nose and then uses a special tool to take the tumor out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75464 \">figure 2</a>). If the surgeon can completely remove it, the amount of growth hormone in the body will return to normal within hours. Some symptoms take a few months to get better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Some people with acromegaly need to take medicines. You might need medicine if you have a pituitary tumor that is too big for doctors to remove it completely with surgery. There are 3 kinds of medicine doctors use to treat acromegaly:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Injections (shots) that stop the tumor from releasing hormones &ndash; These medicines are called &quot;somatostatin analogs.&quot; Your doctor or nurse will probably give you a shot about once a month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicine that blocks the effects of growth hormone &ndash; This medicine is called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegvisomant-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pegvisomant</a> (brand name: Somavert). To take it, you give yourself a shot once a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pills that stop the tumor from releasing hormones &ndash; These are called &quot;dopamine agonists.&quot; They usually don't work as well as somatostatin analogs you get by injection. But they might be easier to take.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation &ndash; Sometimes doctors treat pituitary tumors with radiation. Radiation uses high doses of X-rays to destroy the tumor.</p><p/><p>All of these treatments can have side effects. Your doctor can talk to you about which treatments are best for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13657051\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with acromegaly are able to have normal pregnancies. Before trying to get pregnant, ask your doctors about which medicines are safe to take during pregnancy. You will also need to see your endocrinologist (the doctor who treats your acromegaly) regularly while you are pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13657066\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can successfully treat most people with acromegaly. You will need to see your doctor regularly to make sure that your treatments are working, and make changes if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13657081\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon polyps (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pituitary-adenoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pituitary adenoma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromegaly-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acromegaly (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
