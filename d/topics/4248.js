(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H1073167939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>Coccidioidal meningitis will be reviewed here. Primary infection, extrapulmonary infection outside of the central nervous system, laboratory diagnosis, pulmonary sequelae, and infection in immunocompromised hosts are discussed separately.

However, disseminated infection can occur. Meningitis is the most lethal complication of coccidioidomycosis, and thus it is crucial to recognize this serious complication. If untreated, meningitis is lethal for 95 percent of patients within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This contrasts sharply with most nonmeningeal infections, which are either self-limited respiratory syndromes or cause chronic focal morbidity within or beyond the lungs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis in compromised hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Precise statistics about the incidence of meningitis due to this fungus are not available. The Arizona Department of Health Services found that, in 2007, 8 percent of reported new coccidioidal infections were disseminated and, of these, 17 percent involved the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Applying these statistics to the total number of 4900 reported cases in Arizona provides an annual estimate of about 60 cases in Arizona or 100 cases in the United States. Since it is estimated that there are more than 150,000 infections with <em>Coccidioides</em> spp annually, these estimates suggest that the proportion of patients with meningitis is less than 0.1 percent of all exposures.</p><p>The treatment of coccidioidal meningitis has evolved to include oral therapies that have largely supplanted the need to instill antifungal agents directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. Nonetheless, the management of coccidioidal meningitis remains difficult and often requires the orchestration of several medical subspecialties to optimize the clinical response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two species of <em>Coccidioides</em> have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>C. immitis</em> is more common in California, whereas <em>C. posadasii</em> is more frequently isolated in Arizona, Texas, and Central and South America. The clinical manifestations associated with these two species are similar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H1073167939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953626270\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other forms of disseminated coccidioidal infection, the pulmonary infection spreads hematogenously to establish a tissue destructive lesion in the meninges. This usually occurs early in the course of infection with symptoms developing within weeks to months of primary infection. Occasionally, intervals as long as one to two years have been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>] and may be longer, likely in patients treated initially for primary coccidioidal pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There may be few or no symptoms associated with the primary respiratory infection, and radiographic examination of the chest is frequently completely normal. Approximately half of patients with meningitis have other lesions resulting from hematogenous dissemination, which are manifest in relation to their specific locations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common symptom of coccidioidal meningitis is persistent headache that is present in approximately 75 percent of patients. It should be noted that approximately 20 percent of patients with primary pulmonary infection also complain of headache during their self-limited illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, judgment is required during early infection to select patients who would benefit from further evaluation of this symptom. Characteristics of headaches that might suggest meningitis in a patient known to have recently developed coccidioidal pneumonia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistence of headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive worsening of headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unusual severity of the headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurring of vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in mental status</p><p/><p>If the lumbar meninges are involved, patients may also complain of lumbosacral back pain.</p><p>Physical examination findings are frequently absent early in the course of coccidioidal meningitis. Although not emphasized in previous descriptions of coccidioidal meningitis, tremulousness and an intention tremor are often present. Kernig and Brudzinski signs of meningeal irritation are uncommon. Papilledema, indicating increased intracranial pressure and the development of hydrocephalus, is only an occasional presenting symptom in adults but is quite frequent early in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Papilledema, cranial nerve palsies (resulting from nerve entrapment by basilar meningitis), or evidence of cerebral infarction (resulting from arteritis) are generally observed later in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Gait abnormalities and focal neurologic deficits may be seen in a minority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nonspecific laboratory abnormalities may include hyponatremia in association with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691244661\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify structural abnormalities in the brain, which are not specific for coccidioidal meningitis. Findings include hydrocephalus, basilar meningitis, and cerebral infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hydrocephalus is the most common complication of coccidioidal meningitis, occurring in up to 30 to 50 percent of patients. Vasculitic infarctions are usually due to inflammation of small- and middle-sized blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>CT has been largely supplanted by MRI enhanced with gadolinium due to increased sensitivity, particularly in the setting of vasculitic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MRI is more sensitive than CT for meningeal enhancement in the posterior fossa and provides detailed images of the Sylvian aqueduct and the fourth ventricle, which can become obstructed. An uncommon but serious complication is the development of a vertebral artery aneurysm; patients with suggestive clinical features should undergo magnetic resonance angiography. Spinal arachnoiditis, meningioma-like masses, and cerebral abscesses due to coccidioidomycosis have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms and signs of coccidioidal meningitis are nonspecific and can be produced by a variety of other diseases. Since the onset of symptoms is often subacute or even chronic, management prior to diagnosis is frequently attempted in the outpatient setting with diagnostic procedures scheduled at a pace convenient for the patient and the healthcare delivery system alike. As a consequence, delays in diagnosis of weeks or even months after the onset of meningeal symptoms are common. Diagnostic delays of this magnitude are likely to continue to occur in standard practice unless the clinician elicits a history of endemic exposure to <em>Coccidioides</em> spp and thus elevates coccidioidal meningitis higher in the differential diagnosis of the patient's illness.</p><p>The definitive diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis is supported by isolating <em>Coccidioides</em> species from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other central nervous system (CNS) specimens; however, most cases are presumptively diagnosed through identifying anticoccidioidal antibodies in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691244470\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When coccidioidal meningitis is suspected, we perform a lumbar puncture (LP) and send CSF for routine studies as well as specific tests for <em>Coccidioides</em> spp. Since routine CSF and imaging abnormalities are nonspecific, the diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis requires positive CSF antibodies, growth of the organism, or, as more recently described, the presence of coccidioidal antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] to secure the diagnosis. We send CSF for both fungal culture and antibody testing (immunodiffusion for immunoglobulin [Ig]M and IgG or enzyme immunoassay [EIA] tests for IgG).</p><p>Findings on routine examination of CSF and details about specific diagnostic tests are discussed below.</p><p>Because focal neurologic complications may emerge during treatment, especially within the first two years, it is useful to perform magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium of both the head and spinal cord at baseline. Recommendations regarding follow-up imaging are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring treatment response'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine examination of CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the CSF following a LP is important in diagnosing coccidioidal meningitis, but routine testing is not specific for the diagnosis. Fluid obtained from the lateral ventricle, such as might occur at the time of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement, is often not as helpful as CSF obtained by lumbar or cisternal aspiration and may not be as diagnostically sensitive.</p><p>Lumbar CSF in coccidioidal meningitis usually has increased numbers of leukocytes, ranging from a few to several hundred cells. Very large numbers of leukocytes in the CSF, such as occur with bacterial meningitis, are distinctly unusual. The majority of cells are typically lymphocytic; however, early in the infection, a significant percentage of these leukocytes may be polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), similar to early aseptic meningitis of presumed viral origin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aseptic-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aseptic meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Significant numbers of eosinophils may also occur, but this finding is not specific for coccidioidal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Associated with the CSF pleocytosis is a depression of the CSF glucose, occasionally profoundly low, and an elevation of the CSF protein. Typically, protein concentrations range up to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. If protein concentrations in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 grams are obtained, this suggests that the process has been complicated by obstruction to the normal flow of CSF.</p><p>Rarely, <em>Coccidioides</em> organisms may be seen on direct microscopic examination of the CSF; such a finding would be indicative of a high fungal burden of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691244522\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach when cultures and antibody tests are negative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with symptoms of meningitis and abnormal CSF findings in whom neither antibodies nor fungal growth can be detected from CSF, it may be necessary to infer the diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis from finding anticoccidioidal antibodies in nonmeningeal sources. However, this link is indirect.</p><p>It is usually valuable to continue to try to corroborate the diagnosis with more direct evidence from repeated CSF analyses in such patients because of the profound implications for subsequent management. When we repeat the CSF analysis, we send CSF for routine analysis, coccidioidal antibodies, coccidioidal antigen, and fungal culture as well as for tests to evaluate for other possible causes as indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-chronic-meningitis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with chronic meningitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>). (See <a href=\"#H612385142\" class=\"local\">'CSF coccidioidal antigen levels'</a> below.)</p><p>On rare occasions, infection with <em>Coccidioides</em> spp is the cause of lymphocytic meningitis in which all testing is unable to establish a diagnosis. In some such circumstances, brain biopsy or meningeal biopsy has proven useful when magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement has identified lesions that are amenable to a surgical approach. Histopathology may also be useful if there is another focus of disseminated disease, such as a cutaneous lesion in association with a clinical presentation of chronic meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since routine CSF and imaging abnormalities are nonspecific, the diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis requires serologic or culture findings to secure the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recovering <em>Coccidioides</em> spp from the CSF confirms the diagnosis but has only been possible in approximately 15 percent of initial evaluations. Culturing the sediment of large volumes of CSF improves the diagnostic sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">CSF antibody testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of complement-fixing (CF) IgG antibodies or immunodiffusion tests for IgM and IgG in CSF is nearly as specific as recovery of the organism by culture. In a few patients without meningitis who had either pulmonary or disseminated coccidioidomycosis, low titers of coccidioidal antibodies were found when the CSF was concentrated before testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. CF anticoccidioidal antibodies are not always detectable in early coccidioidal meningitis, although false negatives are less frequent than negative CSF cultures. Serial monitoring of serum coccidioidal IgG level should not be used as a guide for clinical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Other serologic tests may be performed on CSF but are less useful than CF antibodies and immunodiffusion tests. Identifying tube precipitin-type antibodies in CSF is not routinely performed but carries the same significance as CF antibodies if found. Antibodies detected by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH) may also be indicative of coccidioidal meningitis, although the documentation of their significance is not as well established. It is not advisable to perform a latex test on CSF because of the problem of false-positive test results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis: Laboratory diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612385142\"><span class=\"h3\">CSF coccidioidal antigen levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A report from a retrospective review from one medical center and a prospective study from another in Phoenix, Arizona, indicates that measuring coccidioidal antigen concentrations in CSF specimens appears to improve the diagnostic yield of CSF analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the CSF, coccidioidal antigen testing was much more frequently positive (93 percent) than were antibodies (up to 85 percent using different techniques) or cultures (7 percent). CSF coccidioidal antigen concentrations were higher in HIV-infected patients, suggesting that antigen concentration might reflect fungal burden. If so, then serial testing of CSF for antigen concentrations could represent the first direct biomarker of the activity of fungal activity during treatment. However, further study is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1791400246\"><span class=\"h2\">Antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment guidelines for coccidioidomycosis were published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Our approach is consistent with these recommendations, and is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial therapy</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> is the drug of choice for treatment of coccidioidal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. We generally favor a dose of 400 mg daily for patients who are not severely ill, since this is the dose used in clinical trials. However, we give a higher dose (eg, 800 to 1200 mg daily) to those who are severely ill, such as those requiring admission to an intensive care unit. For patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy, intravenous fluconazole can be given at the same dose. A few clinicians initiate therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> in addition to fluconazole for severe disease; although this approach is not recommended in the IDSA guidelines, it is based upon the belief that responses are more prompt with this approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Data demonstrating the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> for the treatment of coccidioidal meningitis come from an open-label study in which 37 of 47 evaluable patients (79 percent) treated with fluconazole at a dose of 400 mg daily responded to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Response rates were similar for patients with and without previous therapy, for patients with and without HIV infection, and for patients with and without pre-existing hydrocephalus. Patients were followed for a median of 38 months and remained on fluconazole during this time; most improvement occurred within four to eight months after starting therapy. Of 10 nonresponders, one received a shunt and then was managed successfully with reinstituting fluconazole at 400 mg per day. Six others were switched to a higher dose of fluconazole (800 mg per day), four appeared to improve, one failed, and one was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining nonresponders, two patients with AIDS died, and one was managed with intrathecal amphotericin B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> (200 mg two to four times daily) is a reasonable alternative if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> is not tolerated or is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, patients receiving itraconazole require close monitoring to assure adequate absorption, and there are more drug-drug interactions with itraconazole compared with fluconazole.

We monitor serum voriconazole trough concentrations in all patients receiving voriconazole for coccidioidal meningitis in order to ensure that adequate concentrations are achieved and to prevent toxicity from high concentrations.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Voriconazole'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Case reports also describe patients with coccidioidal meningitis who were refractory to initial antifungal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> but who improved during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34</a>]. Thus, as with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, posaconazole might also be considered as alternative therapy in selected patients. The usual dosing of posaconazole delayed-release tablets is 300 mg orally twice daily on the first day, then 300 mg once daily thereafter, taken with food. When posaconazole is used for coccidioidal meningitis, we favor a higher dose of 300 mg orally twice daily on the first day, followed by 200 or 300 mg twice daily thereafter, taken with food. Trough concentrations should be obtained after four to seven days of therapy. We suggest a trough concentration &ge;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and we would increase the dose as needed until this concentration is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-azoles#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of azoles&quot;, section on 'Posaconazole'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with persistent lumbar fluid pleocytosis and ongoing neurologic symptoms, intrathecal amphotericin B should be initiated, with or without continuing azole treatment. The intrathecal dose of amphotericin B normally ranges between 0.01 mg and 1.5 mg per dose administered at intervals ranging from daily to weekly, beginning at a low dose and increasing the dose until patient intolerance appears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This is administered by direct cisternal injection or less commonly by ventricular injection or cisternal injection via an Ommaya reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Complications of cisternal puncture (bleeding) and the neurotoxicity of amphotericin B make this a difficult therapy to administer for prolonged periods. Because of its toxicity and difficulty of administration, intrathecal amphotericin B therapy is usually only resorted to by clinicians who are experienced with this therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-amphotericin-b#H463493101\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of amphotericin B&quot;, section on 'Intrathecal'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of increased intracranial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) at the time of diagnosis can be managed with medical therapy and repeated lumbar punctures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, most patients who develop hydrocephalus require a shunt for decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Development of hydrocephalus may occur regardless of the therapy being used and does not in itself dictate switching to alternative therapy.</p><p>Shunts themselves can be associated with a variety of complications; patients can develop recurrent distal obstruction, interventricular foraminal obstruction, and shunt failure. Recurrence of headache, nausea, vomiting, gait disturbance, or mental status changes should lead to prompt imaging of the brain. Patients with shunt malfunction can have the revision performed in a single procedure. However, when the shunt has developed a bacterial or other superinfection, the shunt should be removed and replaced during a second procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

This is frequently gradual and may take several weeks before the improvement is convincing to observers. However, patients subjectively often note improvement earlier. Patient adherence can be problematic over time and lack of medication compliance can lead to serious consequences; patients must be counseled that treatment is lifelong.</p><p>Lumbar puncture (LP) findings also improve but do so even more slowly. Thus, in patients who are continuing to gradually improve symptomatically, follow-up LPs can reasonably be delayed for weeks or months. CSF leukocytosis generally improves, although low numbers of leukocytes often persist for many months or even years in patients who otherwise appear to be doing well. Normalization of the CSF glucose seems to more reliably reflect clinical improvement. Patients who have persistent hydrocephalus often continue to have CSF abnormalities, especially elevated leukocyte counts, despite therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coccidioidal-meningitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Whether serial measurements of CSF coccidioidal antigen will be a faithful surrogate marker of disease activity seems reasonable but has not yet been demonstrated.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coccidioidomycosis has protean manifestations, and primary infection is frequently unrecognized. However, disseminated infection can occur. Meningitis is the most lethal complication of coccidioidomycosis and thus is crucial to recognize. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If untreated, meningitis is lethal for 95 percent of patients within two years. This contrasts sharply to most nonmeningeal infections, which are either self-limited respiratory syndromes or cause chronic focal morbidity within or beyond the lungs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common symptom of coccidioidal meningitis is persistent headache, which is present in approximately 75 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms and signs of coccidioidal meningitis are nonspecific and can be produced by a variety of other diseases. Furthermore, the onset of symptoms is often subacute or even chronic. As a consequence, delays in diagnosis of weeks or even months after the onset of meningeal symptoms are common. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis is supported by isolating <em>Coccidioides</em> species from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other central nervous system specimens; however, most cases are presumptively diagnosed through identifying anticoccidioidal antibodies in the CSF. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CSF usually reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and low glucose concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Routine examination of CSF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the treatment of coccidioidal meningitis, we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We generally favor a dose of 400 mg daily for patients who are not severely ill, but we give a higher dose to those who are severely ill (ie, those requiring admission to an intensive care unit). For patients who cannot tolerate oral fluconazole, intravenous fluconazole can be given at the same dose. Fluconazole has supplanted intrathecal amphotericin B because the latter agent is toxic. (See <a href=\"#H1791400246\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who respond to azole therapy should continue this treatment for life because relapses upon discontinuing treatment are common and potentially fatal. (See <a href=\"#H1791400246\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not respond to initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> 400 mg daily, the dose can be increased to 800 to 1200 mg daily. An alternative option is to change therapy to another orally administered azole (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>). Patients with persistent lumbar fluid pleocytosis and ongoing neurologic symptoms are also candidates for intrathecal amphotericin B therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1791400246\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrocephalus nearly always requires a shunt for decompression. Development of hydrocephalus may occur regardless of the therapy being used and does not in itself dictate switching to alternative therapy.
