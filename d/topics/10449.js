This is a heterogeneous group that includes patients with potentially resectable (T4a (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>)) and unresectable (T4b) primary disease, poor surgical candidates, and those who decline surgery.

Major goals of therapy are restoration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintenance of the ability to swallow, management of pain, and prevention of bleeding. To achieve these goals, a variety of therapies may be used, including external beam radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy, esophageal dilatation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stenting, photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser ablation, chemical ablation, and palliative surgery.</p><p>Optimal palliation usually requires the integration of two or more of these modalities, either concurrently or sequentially. While combined modality therapy offers a small but real chance of prolonged PFS and, potentially, prolonged overall survival, improvement in QOL and sustained relief of dysphagia can be achieved in the majority of patients. However, the durability of symptom palliation is variable.</p><p>This topic focuses on locoregional therapy for locally advanced, inoperable, but nonmetastatic esophageal cancer. The roles of palliative surgery and radiation therapy without or with concurrent chemotherapy will be covered, as well as an overview of endoscopic procedures for palliation of swallowing (dilation, stenting, PDT, and laser ablation). Other approaches to localized esophageal cancer and metastatic disease, as well as a more detailed discussion of endoscopic palliation, are provided in other topic reviews.

Dysphagia can be caused by benign or malignant disorders of the oral cavity, oropharynx, or esophagus.

The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) developed a grading scale for late effects of radiation therapy, which helps standardize the evaluation of dysphagia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70813\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70813 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Regardless of histology, esophageal tumors arising in the cervical, thoracic, or abdominal esophagus, and those involving the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) that have an epicenter within 2 cm of the EGJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351 \">table 4</a>) share the same criteria for T stage, N stage, and M stage designation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>). In contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Staging and evaluation for resectability require endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for T staging (focusing on the possibility of T4 disease) and for staging and evaluation of lymph nodes, computed tomography (CT), and fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), which is often integrated with CT <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span>. For squamous cell cancers (SCCs) located at or above the carina, bronchoscopy is indicated to rule out tracheoesophageal fistula. For cervical SCCs, flexible laryngoscopy to assess local disease spread and exclude a synchronous malignancy of the head and neck is generally recommended.

However, celiac nodal metastases are scored as <strong>regional nodal disease</strong> in the current TNM staging system, regardless of the primary tumor location or histology, and they no longer carry the connotation of distant metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, prognosis is poor in such cases, even if the primary tumor is located in the distal esophagus or EGJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In one series, the two-year survival rate of patients with celiac node involvement who underwent surgery as a component of therapy was approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10737245\"><span class=\"h3\">Unresectable primary disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10737252\"><span class=\"h4\">Thoracic or abdominal esophagus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the current TNM staging criteria, invasion of the pleura, pericardium, azygos vein, peritoneum, or diaphragm is classified as T4a disease and considered potentially resectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, invasion of other adjacent structures, including the aorta, trachea, or vertebral body, constitutes unresectable (T4b) disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F101702\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101702 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>A thorough evaluation of the airway is mandatory for all esophageal cancers at or above the carina, including those involving the middle third of the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111260\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111260 \">figure 1</a>). Meticulous attention should be paid to the preservation or obliteration of fat planes between the esophagus and adjacent structures on chest CT. In general, preservation of fat planes implies no direct tumor invasion and suggests potential resectability.</p><p>On the other hand, obliteration of the fat plane does not necessarily indicate direct tumor invasion and unresectability. In normal patients, fat may be absent between an esophageal carcinoma and the aorta, trachea, left main bronchus, or pericardium, thus complicating the differentiation between an abutting tumor and true invasion. Fat planes may also be absent in cachectic patients who do not have evidence of tumor invasion.</p><p>If the tumor abuts the aorta with obliteration of the normal adventitial plane, there will likely be a positive radial margin, but this finding does not preclude exploration if there are no other findings to indicate unresectability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Invasion of the aorta (and thus, unresectable disease) is suggested by an arc of contact between the tumor and the aorta that is more than 90 degrees, although this is not absolute confirmation of an unresectable T4b tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10737259\"><span class=\"h4\">Cervical esophageal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For tumors of the cervical esophagus (which extends from the hypopharynx to the sternal notch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111260\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111260 \">figure 1</a>)), infiltration into the prevertebral fascia or posterior larynx, invasion of the membranous trachea to the level of the carina, or significant bilateral encasement of major neurovascular structures precludes surgical resection. Regardless of apparent resectability, however, tumors of the cervical esophagus are rarely resected, due to the resultant functional deficits and impairment of quality of life. They are more often treated in a similar manner to head and neck SCCs.

Rarely, patients with initially unresectable disease will have a sufficient disease response to warrant subsequent surgical consideration. However, particularly for SCCs, the benefit of postchemoradiotherapy surgery is debated, even in those with initially localized potentially resectable disease. In our view, definitive chemoradiotherapy is appropriate for patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal SCC. For patients with adenocarcinoma, the role of nonoperative treatment remains poorly defined. (See <a href=\"#H102257190\" class=\"local\">'Role of postchemoradiotherapy surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Historically, external beam RT played an important role in the management of unresectable esophageal cancer, both for palliation of dysphagia and for maintenance of long-term locoregional disease control. Although RT alone may successfully palliate dysphagia, sustained remission and long-term survival are rarely achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9,12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12-16</a>].

Most of these studies were flawed because of suboptimal doses of RT or chemotherapy, or the sequential, rather than concurrent, delivery of chemotherapy and RT.

The incidence of a TE fistula during chemoradiotherapy was 6 percent in one series and accounted for one-half of all fistulas that developed in patients with esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The others presented before the initiation of therapy; in this cohort, spontaneous closure of the fistula after completion of chemoradiotherapy was noted in 70 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Esophageal stenting is a risk factor for a post-RT TE fistula. In a report of 208 patients who underwent stent placement with or without palliative RT for inoperable, locally advanced esophageal cancer, 18 developed a TE fistula, 17 of whom had received RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk of a TE fistula was higher among patients who received RT after stent placement compared with those who received it beforehand. In our own experience, TE fistulas occur more often with SCC than with adenocarcinoma due to proximity to the airways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with a persistent TE fistula after the completion of treatment, options for symptomatic management include airway stents, esophageal stents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60771\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60771 \">picture 1</a>), or surgery. In most cases, symptomatic treatment and closure of the fistula are achieved with stenting; dual stenting appears to work better than single prosthesis, both for palliation and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Surgical intervention (eg, esophageal bypass, palliative resection) is justified in very few cases and carries very high morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strictures</strong> &ndash; Post-RT strictures may be either benign or malignant and may lead to recurrent dysphagia.

The majority of patients with benign strictures were successfully dilated and had a 12-month survival rate of 88 percent, compared with 19 percent for those with malignant strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102257160\"><span class=\"h5\">Patients presenting with a malignant fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a malignant TE fistula in patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer was historically considered a relative contraindication for RT or chemoradiotherapy because of the high rate of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, at least some data support the view that selected patients who have a previously unirradiated T4 lesion with a malignant fistula can be safely treated with chemoradiotherapy, with some achieving at least transient closure of the fistula and, occasionally, long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>]. Toxicity may be prominent, and most patients fail to achieve long-term local control.

However, to date, none has been shown to definitively improve outcomes, and toxicity may be worse. None of these approaches can be recommended outside of the context of a clinical trial.</p><p>RTOG protocol 85-01 clearly demonstrated that patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (mostly SCC) can be cured without surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. However, the local failure rate (persistent and recurrent disease) of approximately 45 percent in patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (as has been seen in other trials as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/10,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30</a>]) leaves much room for improvement.

At present, none of these approaches has been shown to improve outcomes, and none can be recommended over standard fractionation RT (50.4 to 54 Gy total dose in daily 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions) for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>US Intergroup trial 0123 compared high-dose external beam RT (64.8 Gy) with the previous standard (50.4 Gy), with both schedules being administered with concurrent chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus infusional FU) in 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to 4, NX, M0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>) esophageal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Two additional chemotherapy courses were repeated four weeks after the completion of RT. The trial was closed early because there was no demonstrable survival or local control advantage from higher-dose RT, although most of the deaths occurred before reaching escalated doses. Furthermore, there was a higher rate of toxic deaths (9 versus 2 percent) with the higher RT dose. One- and two-year survival rates were 66 and 40 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another approach to RT dose intensification is the addition of brachytherapy to external beam RT and chemotherapy. Brachytherapy permits treatment of a localized area of the esophagus to high radiation doses with relative sparing of surrounding structures. It can be administered using two general methods: low dose rate brachytherapy (LDRB) and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB). Modern HDRB equipment delivers radiation at a high dose rate, permitting the delivery of a planned dose within minutes, compared with LDRB sources, which require many hours or days. Because of this high dose rate, fractionation is necessary; typically, two to four fractions are administered for treatment of esophageal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Brachytherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The combination of chemoradiotherapy with a brachytherapy boost has been investigated in patients ineligible for surgical resection. However, randomized trials comparing this approach with chemoradiotherapy alone are not currently available, and the results of uncontrolled trials are mixed. While encouraging results are reported by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>], others demonstrate prohibitive toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consensus guidelines for brachytherapy in the treatment of esophageal cancer from the American Brachytherapy Society are presented in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73664%7EONC%2F80000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73664 graphicRef80000 \">table 6A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, given the potential for treatment-related toxicity, we recommend that if brachytherapy is given as a component of treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer, chemotherapy not be administered concurrently with brachytherapy. Furthermore, brachytherapy should be used with extreme caution in the setting of a local recurrence after prior chemoradiotherapy because of the risk of fistula formation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102257178\"><span class=\"h5\">Chemotherapy intensification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Others have explored the use of novel combinations, targeted agents, or alternative radiation sensitizers (eg, taxanes, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>) during RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/39-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-50</a>].

Surgery should only be attempted if an R0 resection is technically feasible and after distant metastatic disease has been carefully ruled out. Although there is no consensus as to which patients are appropriate candidates, we typically reserve salvage esophagectomy for patients with early stage recurrent disease (ie, node negative, T1 to 2 disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>). We generally do not pursue salvage surgery for patients with disease persistence after definitive chemoradiotherapy, particularly with adenocarcinomas. Persistent disease likely represents a more aggressive phenotype than recurrent disease, and outcomes with salvage surgery are poorer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Distant metastatic disease is the cause of death in the majority of such patients, and esophagectomy is unlikely to improve survival. </p><p>The high local failure rates for definitive chemoradiotherapy alone have led some to question whether postchemoradiotherapy salvage surgery could be selectively applied to patients who fail to respond or who recur after completing chemoradiotherapy alone. While long-term disease control has been achieved in a few patients (three-year survival rate 17 percent in one retrospective series of 46 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]), there is little doubt that salvage esophagectomy is a more morbid operation than either primary esophagectomy or planned esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/58-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-67</a>].</p><p>The feasibility of salvage esophagectomy for persistent or recurrent disease following definitive chemoradiotherapy relates to two major issues: meticulous selection of candidates who are appropriate for salvage surgery (true local failures without metastatic disease), and experienced surgical skills in performing esophagectomy with measured and acceptable operative mortality.</p><p>A major problem is the difficulty in diagnosing recurrent or persistent local disease. In contrast to the primary diagnosis of esophageal cancer, which is usually straightforward, EUS and CT are of limited utility for assessing locoregional therapeutic response; furthermore, endoscopic biopsies are sometimes negative despite the presence of viable tumor in deeper layers of the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. PET-CT may offer some advantages over conventional anatomic imaging; however, it too suffers from false-positive and false-negative results in patients with prior interventions such as stent placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'PET restaging after initial induction therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer#H3265018875\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'CT, PET, and integrated PET/CT'</a>.)</p><p>A persistent stricture may be the only clue that malignant disease is present; confirmation is often difficult, but it is essential if salvage esophagectomy is being considered. A lack of tumor in the resected esophagectomy specimen represents a diagnostic failure and a particularly difficult situation should the patient die (disease free) after surgery. Conclusive evidence of a local failure on a biopsy specimen and absence of metastases (distant failure) on a restaging PET scan should be obtained before embarking on salvage esophagectomy for locally recurrent disease.</p><p>A locoregional failure following chemoradiotherapy may manifest as persistent disease at the completion of the planned definitive therapy (primary failure) or as recurrent disease months later (secondary failure). Although surgery may be easier to perform in the setting of a primary failure, these patients are chemoradiotherapy nonresponders, and their anticipated survival is poor. As a group, they are more likely to die from metastatic than locoregionally recurrent disease. On the other hand, a carefully selected patient with a late recurrence may have a better cancer prognosis, but the potential for long-term survival must be balanced against the technical difficulty and greater morbidity of salvage esophagectomy in this setting.</p><p>Thus, salvage esophagectomy can be performed with acceptable mortality in selected patients in the hands of experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The best way to select patients for this approach is not established. </p><p>A substantial number of patients, particularly those with SCC, have a pCR after chemoradiotherapy (eg, in the CROSS trial, 49 percent of patients with SCC and 23 percent of patients with adenocarcinoma achieved pCRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-inoperable-esophageal-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]), and these patients may not benefit from surgery.

Furthermore, although palliative resection can relieve dysphagia, restoration of the ability to swallow can now be accomplished successfully nonsurgically in the majority of patients and is most commonly achieved by the placement of an endoluminal stent.
