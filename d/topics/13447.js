It happens in some people who have had surgery or radiation treatment for cancer. Not all people treated for cancer get lymphedema.</p><p>The body has a network of vessels called the &quot;lymphatic system&quot; that carries a clear fluid called &quot;lymph&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86801 \">figure 1</a>). The lymph nodes are part of this system. The lymphatic system is similar to the system of blood vessels. But instead of blood, the lymphatic system carries lymph, which contains infection-fighting cells. Lymphedema happens when the flow of lymph through the lymphatic system gets backed up. Cancer treatments, such as surgery or radiation, can damage lymph nodes or vessels in the armpit or groin and cause peripheral lymphedema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663121\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of peripheral lymphedema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of peripheral lymphedema are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in your limb</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aching pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tight or heavy feeling in the affected limb</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the affected limb</p><p/><p>The symptoms can come on slowly. It might be weeks, months, or even years after your cancer treatment before you have symptoms of peripheral lymphedema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663138\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for peripheral lymphedema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but this is usually not needed. Your doctor or nurse can figure out if you have peripheral lymphedema by talking to you about your symptoms and doing an exam. An important part of the exam will be to measure the length around the affected limb. This measurement is called your &quot;limb circumference.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663153\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It is very important to avoid injury or infections of your affected limb. There are also actions you can take to help prevent more swelling.</p><p>To avoid injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your skin clean. Wash with a mild soap every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be careful with your nails. Don't pick at the skin around your nails or cut your cuticles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use lotion to keep your skin from getting dry and cracked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an electric razor instead of a razor blade to shave.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always use sunscreen when you go outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an arm is affected, wear gloves when gardening, cooking, or doing other things that could hurt your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a leg is affected, wear hard-soled shoes when outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you do get a small cut, scrape, or bite on your arm, hand, leg, or foot, clean it well with soap and water. Then use an antibiotic cream, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bacitracin</a>. Call your doctor or nurse if it does not heal quickly or if you have signs of an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, avoid shots, blood draws, or IV lines in the limb with lymphedema. Avoid other procedures that puncture the skin, like acupuncture or tattooing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have lymphedema in an arm, avoid routinely having your blood pressure taken on that side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid saunas, steam baths, and hot tubs.</p><p/><p>To prevent swelling:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear loose fitting clothes and jewelry, unless it is a special garment or bandage your doctor or nurse gives you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your weight under control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not let your arm hang at your side for long periods of time without moving it. If your leg is affected, avoid standing for long periods of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your limb raised on pillows when you're sitting or lying down.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663168\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have increased swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have redness or a rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The affected limb feels warm to the touch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) that is not from a cold or other illness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663183\"><span class=\"h1\">How is peripheral lymphedema treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for lymphedema. But there are treatments that can help reduce the swelling and make you more comfortable. These treatments work best if you start them before the swelling has gotten too bad, so see a doctor or nurse as soon as you notice any swelling. It is best to go to clinics that have people who have experience treating lymphedema.</p><p>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; Exercise can help keep lymphedema from getting worse. During exercise, people with lymphedema should always wear a compression bandage or sleeve (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression bandaging &ndash; Compression bandaging is a special kind of bandaging that puts gentle, steady pressure on the swollen area. This helps keep the swelling down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression &quot;sleeves&quot; or &quot;hosiery&quot; &ndash; These work a lot like compression bandaging. They put gentle, steady pressure on the affected limb to keep swelling down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual lymphatic drainage &ndash; For this treatment, a physical therapist massages your limb in a special way to help move the fluid that has built up.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663198\"><span class=\"h1\">Can peripheral lymphedema be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. If you have breast cancer, a surgeon might need to remove lymph nodes from the armpit area, to check if the cancer has spread. Removing all or most of the lymph nodes in this area increases the risk of getting arm lymphedema later. In some cases, doctors can avoid this and only remove 1 or a few lymph nodes. This lowers the risk of lymphedema.</p><p>Lymphedema cannot always be prevented, but if you treat it early, you might be able to keep it from becoming too severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6663230\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-for-breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphedema-after-cancer-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lymphedema after cancer surgery (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
