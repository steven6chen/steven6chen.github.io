When large areas of skin are affected or specialized anatomic sites are involved, management in an inpatient setting, often at a burn center, is recommended. </p><p>Superficial burns are managed by maintaining a moist wound healing environment and protecting the wound from shear, tearing, and further injury while promoting reepithelialization. Dressings are chosen to help to manage wound drainage and are changed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (eg, daily, or every second or third day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Superficial skin loss from other types of injury, such as chemical burns, or skin loss from toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is managed using similar principles. However, there are some differences. As an example, superficial skin loss from TEN is characterized by wounds that are not often challenged by problems of exudate management but may suffer from complicated superinfection. In addition to wound care, the underlying pathophysiologic cause needs to be specifically addressed. Chemical burns may require additional therapies to neutralize deleterious local or systemic effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Management, prognosis, and long-term sequelae&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-chemical-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical chemical burns&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with superficial skin loss requiring hospitalization (predominantly thermal burns), the management of potential complications, and follow-up care are reviewed here. </p><p>Treatment of minor burns (not requiring hospital admission) and treatment of deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minor-thermal-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minor thermal burns&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1878043147\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPERFICIAL BURNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns are classified and treated according to the depth of tissue injury (ie, superficial [epidermal], superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, full-thickness, and deeper burns) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61540 \">table 1</a>).

These do not blister but are painful, dry, red, and blanch with pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55928 \">picture 1</a>). This process is commonly seen with sunburns. Over two to three days the pain and erythema subside, and by approximately day 4, the injured epithelium peels away from the newly healed epidermis. Such injuries are generally healed in six days with conservative care without scarring. However, burns that initially appear to be only epidermal in depth may be determined to be partial thickness 12 to 24 hours later. Patients with extensive epidermal burns may require admission to manage significant pain, dehydration, or other associated challenges or social issues and comorbidities such as drug or alcohol use and neglect. Patients with sunburns are counseled as to prevention strategies, the potential for sun damage, detrimental actinic changes, and skin cancer concerns.</p><p>Partial-thickness burns involve the epidermis and portions of the dermis. Partial-thickness burns can be superficial or deep, each of which require different therapy; however, it is often difficult to distinguish between superficial partial-thickness and deep partial-thickness burns immediately following the burn. As a result, these burns must be reevaluated frequently during the first 72 hours. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial partial-thickness burns characteristically form blisters within 24 hours between the epidermis and dermis. They are painful, red, and weeping and blanch with pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75398\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75398 \">picture 2</a>). These burns generally heal in 7 to 21 days, and, though scarring is unusual, pigment changes can occur. Treatment of superficial partial-thickness burns includes debridement, topical antimicrobial applications, and dressing changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deeper burns (deep partial-thickness and deep burns) require excision and skin grafting.

For breakthrough pain during dressing changes or physical therapy, additional opioids and anxiolytics may be used. Patients treated with multidrug regimens should be monitored for adverse drug interactions and respiratory compromise.

There is no consensus on which topical agent or dressing is best suited for these burn wounds. A review of 26 randomized trials (most with methodologic shortcomings) did not identify an optimal dressing type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Furthermore, because superficial partial-thickness burns may not always be easily distinguished from deeper injuries, topical antimicrobial agents are often used. For superficial burns, we suggest starting with a combination antibiotic ointment or creme (eg, Polysporin) covered with a nonadherent dressing (eg, Xeroform or Adaptic). When in close proximity to the eyes, we use an ophthalmic ointment without steroids.</p><p>Clean and still moist wounds, particularly when they occur in the pediatric patient population or in functional and aesthetic regions such as the face, hands, feet, and chest, are often definitively managed using biologic and biosynthetic dressings (eg, Biobrane, TransCyte, EpiBurn) or silver dressings (eg, Acticoat).

After judicious debridement, the wound site may be treated with a topical antimicrobial agent or nonadherent dressing regimen.</p><p>Initially, burn wounds are gently and carefully cleansed and then reevaluated. Cleansing can be performed using skin disinfectants or mild soap and water. An additional debridement is generally performed using gentle mechanical techniques (eg, brushing, scraping, curetting, and cutting). In our practice, we generally prefer to begin with well-moistened soft gauze or cotton laparotomy pads. When more aggressive debridement is required, we will often use well-moistened <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> surgical scrub brushes.</p><p>A variety of proteolytic enzymes (eg, collagenase, bromelain) have been selectively used to debride burn wounds without damage to the normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Due to the unique anatomy of the palmar skin, most burns to the palmar surface in adults and children can be managed conservatively. A retrospective review of 168 pediatric patients with palm burns found that 87 percent healed with conservative, nonoperative management and only four of those palms (2.4 percent) required late reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the skin overlying the dorsum of the hand is much thinner. The underlying and more superficially positioned joints and tendons require early excision and coverage with either skin grafts or a tissue flap.

Ruptured blisters can be managed with a nonadherent gauze dressing, a topically applied antimicrobial dressing, or a hydrocolloid dressing.</p><p>Burn patients should be referred to a surgeon with expertise in burn care if complete or near-complete reepithelialization takes longer than three to four weeks, as well as at the first sign of hypertrophic scarring. The development of hypertrophic scarring occurs in wounds that require more than 21 days to heal. The application of pressure garments is often advocated for our patients, as are massage and moisturization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For established hypertrophic scars, silicone sheeting is also often recommended. Patients who develop functional or disfiguring scarring should be treated by a surgeon experienced in burn care.

Superficial burns are treated conservatively with debridement, topical agents, and dressing changes while deeper burns require excision and grafting. Wound depth can evolve from superficial to deep; thus, reassessment is important. (See <a href=\"#H2856446158\" class=\"local\">'Reassessment of burn wounds'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with extensive superficial burns, particularly those with comorbid illness, or with questionable patient reliability, noncompliance, suspected or known abuse, or involvement of special anatomic sites, require inpatient evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H697594949\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient assessment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus on which topical agent or dressing is best suited for burn wound management. In the absence of high-quality data comparing agents, the choice can be made based on burn wound characteristics, phase of burn wound healing, frequency of dressing changes, provider familiarity, local availability, and cost. (See <a href=\"#H3940153255\" class=\"local\">'Burn wound dressings and topical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, superficial (epidermal) burns do not require antimicrobial therapy, but for extensive superficial (epidermal or superficial partial-thickness) burns, topical antimicrobials may be used to prevent colonization while maintaining a moist wound healing environment. Furthermore, because superficial partial-thickness burns may not always be easily distinguished from deeper injuries, topical antimicrobial agents are often used. For superficial burns, we suggest starting with a combination antibiotic ointment or creme (eg, Polysporin) covered with a nonadherent dressing (eg, Xeroform or Adaptic) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). When in close proximity to the eyes, we use an ophthalmic ointment without steroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care#H2130890734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial agents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dressing changes should be frequent enough to control exudate but not so frequent as to interfere with wound reepithelialization. It appears best to change dressings whenever they become soaked with excessive exudate or other fluids or if there are signs of infection. (See <a href=\"#H3940153255\" class=\"local\">'Burn wound dressings and topical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of oral medications are used to treat burn wound pain and post-burn pruritus. Topical agents are also available to treat pruritus. (See <a href=\"#H2684074424\" class=\"local\">'Burn wound pruritus'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-burn-wound-pain-and-itching#H1085423102\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of burn wound pain and itching&quot;, section on 'Local treatment of pruritus'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with superficial burns not initially managed at a burn center, referral to a surgeon with expertise in burn care should be made if complete or near-complete reepithelialization takes longer than three to four weeks, as this is a risk factor for hypertrophic scarring.
