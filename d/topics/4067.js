Distinction between these two forms of HIT is made based on clinical parameters such as the timing and degree of platelet count drop, and laboratory testing if needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HIT type I (HIT I) is a mild, transient drop in platelet count that typically occurs within the first two days of heparin exposure. The platelet count typically returns to normal with continued heparin administration. The mechanism appears to be due to a direct effect of heparin on platelets (eg, by causing non-immune-mediated platelet aggregation). The typical platelet count nadir is around <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span>. This form of HIT is not considered clinically significant, is <strong>not</strong> associated with thrombosis, and patients can be managed expectantly without discontinuation of heparin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HIT type II (HIT II) is a clinically significant syndrome due to antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexed to heparin. These antibodies can cause thrombosis along with thrombocytopenia; hence, this syndrome has also been called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). The risk of thrombosis, including life-threatening limb gangrene, persists until heparin is eliminated and an alternate anticoagulant is substituted for heparin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subclinical HIT</strong> &ndash; Subclinical HIT refers to the status of a patient who has recovered from an episode of HIT and has persistent HIT antibodies. Such individuals are at high risk of HIT recurrence if re-exposed to heparin. Subclinical HIT should be distinguished from the presence of naturally occurring or clinically silent anti-PF4 antibodies (eg, with no associated thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, or other clinical manifestations).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune HIT</strong> &ndash; Both preclinical models and clinical experience support the presence of an autoimmune mechanism for some cases of HIT. This includes the following clinical scenarios:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Spontaneous HIT</strong> &ndash; Rarely, HIT has been described in the absence of heparin exposure; this condition has been termed &quot;spontaneous HIT.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H7618067\" class=\"local\">'No prior heparin exposure (spontaneous HIT)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Delayed-onset HIT</strong> &ndash; Delayed-onset HIT, in which thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis occur after heparin has been withdrawn. (See <a href=\"#H369779240\" class=\"local\">'Delayed-onset HIT following heparin withdrawal'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HIT occurring in the setting of exposure to minimal amount of heparin, as in &quot;heparin flushes.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H369779196\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Persisting HIT</strong> &ndash; Persisting thrombocytopenia for weeks after stopping heparin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heparin-induced antibodies (HIA)</strong> &ndash; Some patients make antibodies that crossreact in laboratory assays for HIT but do not cause thrombocytopenia or thrombosis. These antibodies can occur in patients exposed to heparin (eg, during cardiopulmonary bypass) or with other conditions in the absence of heparin exposure (eg, lupus). These antibodies are sometimes called heparin-induced antibodies (HIA). Their clinical significance is variable, highlighting the difference between the presence of detectable HIA and the clinical syndrome of HIT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82161 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8928576\" class=\"local\">'Formation of HIT antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8927918\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8928576\"><span class=\"h2\">Formation of HIT antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has an unusual immunobiology compared with other drug-induced antibodies, which includes the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HIT, IgG antibodies are formed rapidly (within days), rather than a primary IgM response followed by IgG formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HIT, the IgG antibodies disappear over time; however, this does not imply that heparin can be used upon disappearance of the antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H25998098\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Lifelong heparin avoidance (list of sources)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HIT, immune memory does not always occur (ie, re-challenge does not always cause an anamnestic response), although individuals with recent heparin exposure may develop clinical findings of HIT in a shorter timeframe than those without recent heparin exposure. (See <a href=\"#H369779234\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The HIT immune response is similar to the T-cell independent B-cell activation that is seen with immune reactions against viruses with repetitive epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Platelets coated with platelet factor 4 (PF4) have also been described as mimicking PF4-coated bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, it has been hypothesized that HIT may be an immune defense mechanism that has been mistakenly directed against platelets.</p><p>HIT antibodies are directed against PF4 complexed with heparin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50473 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. It is thought that the binding of heparin (or other polyanions) induces a conformational change in the PF4 protein that creates a neoantigen, and HIT antibodies bind to this PF4 neoantigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-10</a>]. Thus, these antibodies usually only cause clinical symptoms when heparin is present. Formation of HIT antibodies typically requires exposure to heparins for four or more days. Rare cases of HIT have been described in the absence of heparin exposure; it is thought that an inflammatory stimulus or exposure to non-heparin polyanions may be responsible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7618067\" class=\"local\">'No prior heparin exposure (spontaneous HIT)'</a> below.)</p><p>The PF4 protein is stored in platelet alpha granules. Platelet activation causes release of PF4, which forms a tetramer that binds to and neutralizes heparin and related endogenous molecules (eg, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate) on endothelial surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Heparin-PF4 complexes also form on the platelet surface.</p><p>HIT antibodies may bind to heparin-PF4 complexes on the platelet surface (via heparin binding to cell surface proteins) or to PF4 attached to platelet surface glycosaminoglycans (heparin-like molecules) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]; data from mouse models suggest that the latter is the primary event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Once HIT antibodies bind to PF4 on the platelet surface, their Fc region is captured by Fc receptors on the surface of the same or adjacent platelets (Fc gamma RIIA receptors), creating a positive feedback loop of further platelet activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This in turn leads to release of more PF4, which creates more antigenic substrate for HIT antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Animal models suggest that the amount of endogenous PF4 in platelets plays a pivotal role in this sequence of events, with higher amounts of platelet PF4 conferring the greatest risk of developing clinical HIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>HIT antibodies of the IgG, IgM, and IgA subclass can form, but IgG is thought to be the only pathogenic antibody, because the platelet surface Fc receptor only recognizes IgG.</p><p>Of interest, naturally-occurring antibodies that react with PF4 bound to heparin are present in 3 to 8 percent of the general population without HIT. It has been suggested that these antibodies are induced when PF4 binds to negatively-charged polysaccharides on the surface of bacteria, creating an antigen in PF4 that mimics PF4 bound to heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This pre-exposure to the PF4 antigen may be responsible for the rapid appearance of HIT antibodies following treatment of some patients with heparin.</p><p>PF4 is also a chemokine ligand (designated CXCL4). It has roles in inflammation and angiogenesis, through effects on neutrophil, monocyte, and endothelial cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8928737\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major mechanism of thrombocytopenia in HIT is removal of IgG-coated platelets by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen, liver, bone marrow), similar to other types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia. A second cause of thrombocytopenia is consumption of platelets within thrombi.</p><p>Unlike other forms of drug-induced thrombocytopenia, HIT is also associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. The mechanism is unknown, although the ability of HIT antibodies to activate platelets is paramount. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-biology#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet biology&quot;, section on 'Platelet activation'</a>.)</p><p>A genetic polymorphism in the platelet-associated immunoglobulin Fc receptor has been proposed to enhance platelet activation by increasing the binding of HIT antibodies. In a study of 89 patients with HIT, thrombosis was more frequent in individuals with an arginine rather than a histidine at amino acid position 131 on both alleles of the receptor (ie, Fc&gamma;RIIA 131RR rather than Fc&gamma;RIIA 131HH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The odds ratio (OR) for thromboembolic events with the 131RR allele was 5.9 (95% CI 1.7-20). A model based on in vitro testing was proposed, in which reduced ability of the 131RR Fc receptor to bind endogenous IgG2 might increase the avidity of binding of HIT antibodies and subsequent platelet activation, in turn leading to a higher likelihood of thrombosis. Additional studies of this model are likely to be informative regarding the potential clinical implications.</p><p>Other potential contributions to thrombosis in HIT, not mutually exclusive, include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50473 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of procoagulant substances from activated platelets</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of platelet microparticles (ie, fragments derived from the platelet membrane) that can catalyze clot formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial cell activation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial cell injury induced by binding of HIT antibodies to heparan sulfate on endothelial cell surfaces, leading to increased tissue factor and thrombin generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/3,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24-26</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial cell release of adhesion molecules (eg, interleukin-6, von Willebrand factor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of monocytes by HIT antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alteration of other aspects of the coagulation cascade by HIT antibodies (eg, reduced generation of activated protein C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8927930\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of HIT (eg, risk of thrombosis, duration of antibody persistence) varies in different patient populations (eg, medical, surgical).

The greater incidence of HIT in women is unexplained. (See <a href=\"#H369779196\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>HIT can occur with any heparin dose, schedule, and administration route. However, the molar ratio of PF4 to heparin influences the concentration and size of PF4-heparin complexes on the platelet surface, which in turn influences antigenicity and clinical sequelae. A ratio of PF4 tetramers to heparin molecules of 1:1 causes formation of more ultralarge complexes and is more immunogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Ultralarge complexes form most efficiently with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>; their formation is 10-fold less efficient with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, and negligible with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>. These biochemical findings correlate with the greatest incidence of HIT in surgical patients receiving unfractionated rather than LMW heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with greater amounts of PF4 in the circulation or on platelet surfaces also have a higher likelihood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of HIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4,31,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31,39</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H369779196\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal 1:1 molar ratio for forming ultralarge PF4-heparin complexes may also explain why those exposed to very high doses of heparin (eg, during cardiopulmonary bypass) are less likely to develop HIT than those exposed to standard doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This stoichiometric dependence also underscores the basis for using high doses of heparin to demonstrate reduced binding of true HIT antibodies in immunoassays for HIT (See <a href=\"#H1425605\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15146762\" class=\"local\">'Immunoassay (eg, ELISA)'</a> below.)</p><p>The titer of the HIT antibody may also influence the timing of HIT. High titer antibodies that react with PF4 bound to non-heparin glycosaminoglycans (eg, chondroitin sulfate) have been proposed to explain the occurrence of HIT in patients who have never been exposed to heparin, or those who develop delayed-onset HIT following heparin withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>].

Factors that increase the frequency of HIT include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unfractionated versus LMW heparin</strong> &ndash; HIT occurs more commonly after exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> than exposure to low molecular weight (LMW) heparin in surgical patients. A meta-analysis of 15 studies that evaluated the risk of HIT with prophylactic unfractionated versus LMW heparin (7287 patients, most undergoing orthopedic surgery) found the following absolute risks of developing HIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Unfractionated heparin</a> &ndash; 2.6 percent (95% CI 1.5-3.8 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>LMW heparin &ndash; 0.2 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is unclear if medical patients also have a lower risk of HIT with LMW than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, as some studies have shown this effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>] and others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies comparing unfractionated versus LMW heparin in 5275 medical patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) found no difference in the risk of HIT according to the type of heparin used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients treated with LMW heparin can develop HIT regardless of whether their prior exposure was to unfractionated or LMW heparin. This was demonstrated in a prospective cohort study of 1754 consecutive medical patients treated with LMW heparin in which the overall incidence of HIT was 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In a hospital database review of 24,068 patients exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, HIT occurred in 0.76 percent receiving therapeutic intravenous heparin and &lt;0.1 percent receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there is no dose of heparin that is too low to cause HIT. Patients have developed HIT after exposure to as little as 250 units from a heparin flush or after the use of heparin-coated catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/50-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-56</a>]. In some cases, these may represent a form of autoimmune HIT, as strong platelet activation induced by patient serum has been demonstrated in the absence of heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to therapeutic dose heparin, very high doses such as those used in cardiopulmonary bypass may be associated with a lower risk of HIT than therapeutic dose heparin.

In rare or complex cases, a clinician may suspect HIT despite a low probability 4 T's score (eg, platelet count just outside a cutoff value, uncertainty regarding alternative causes of thrombocytopenia), and a presumptive clinical diagnosis of HIT may be made.</p><p/><p>Any change in clinical findings (eg, development of a new thrombosis, further drop in platelet count) should prompt re-evaluation and recalculation of the 4 T's score, with appropriate HIT antibody testing based on the revised risk.</p><p>However, as stated in a 2013 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline, the 4 T's score should be used as a guide for clinicians and should not substitute for clinical judgement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The scoring system has not been compared with the accuracy of intuition-based diagnosis. Thus, clinicians, particularly those who have less familiarity with HIT, should involve the consulting hematologist as early as possible in determining the likelihood of HIT, because a presumptive diagnosis of HIT carries management implications (eg, discontinuation of heparin, administration of a non-heparin anticoagulant). Not diagnosing HIT when it is present or mistakenly diagnosing HIT when it is absent are both associated with significant risks (eg, life-threatening thrombosis if a diagnosis is missed; life-threatening bleeding and high cost of presumptive treatment with a non-heparin anticoagulant if an incorrect diagnosis is made) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>A presumptive diagnosis of HIT should not be delayed while awaiting results of HIT antibody testing.

As an example, a HIT ELISA result of optical density (OD) &lt;0.40 effectively eliminates the possibility of HIT, and an OD &gt;2.00 is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of HIT. In contrast, we generally consider an OD of 0.40 to 2.00 to be indeterminate and proceed to further testing with a functional assay for HIT antibodies.

This is an immunoassay that detects the presence of anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies in patient serum. As noted below, rapid turnaround immunoassays that can be performed on single samples (turnaround time 20 to 30 minutes) are being developed and appear to be accurate.</p><p>The assay is performed by adding patient serum to a microtiter plate coated with heparin-PF4 complexes or polyanion-PF4 complexes that generate the HIT antigen on PF4. If HIT antibodies are present in the patient sample, they will bind the PF4 complex and can be identified by adding a second antibody coupled to an enzyme for detection. The intensity of a colorimetric change correlates with the concentration of the HIT antibody in the patient sample. This intensity is reported as the optical density (OD) at a specific wavelength (typically 405 nm). A higher OD represents a higher titer of antibody in the patient's serum, which is more strongly suggestive of HIT than a low titer.</p><p>The turnaround time for ELISA testing varies among centers, often as a reflection of the volume of HIT testing performed, which determines how frequently a batch of tests is run, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the time of the week (eg, limited availability on weekends).</p><p>Most laboratories report the results of a HIT ELISA assay as positive or negative based on a predetermined OD cut-off value. However, it is important that laboratories also report the OD of the ELISA assay because the OD correlates with the likelihood of HIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/106,117-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,117-120</a>].

In this study, the overall rate of arterial or venous thrombosis was 23.3 percent, and the 30-day mortality was 16.7 percent. For every 1-unit increase in the OD, there was an approximate doubling in the odds of thrombosis (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI 1.5-2.6). Regression analysis predicted that the proportion of patients with clinically evident thrombosis at an OD of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 were 19, 32, and 48 percent, respectively.</p><p>The high sensitivity of the ELISA (ie, a negative test strongly suggests HIT is <strong>not</strong> the diagnosis) has been corroborated by other studies, with reported sensitivities of 91 to &gt;97 percent. Thus, if the OD is &lt;0.40, we do not perform further testing unless the clinical findings change, because the likelihood of HIT is exceedingly low.</p><p>However, ELISAs for HIT have a low specificity (ie, a positive test may occur in the setting of non-HIT conditions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/68,122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,122-124</a>]. False positive tests for the HIT ELISA can be due to other conditions such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, usually with lower ODs. Thus, if the OD is &gt;2.00 in a patient with intermediate or high likelihood of HIT by clinical criteria (ie, 4 T's score), we consider the patient to have HIT and do not do any further testing. However, if the OD is indeterminate (OD 0.40 to 2.00), we treat the patient presumptively for HIT until we can obtain the results of a functional assay.</p><p>A rapid liquid phase immunoassay has also been developed with a high negative predictive value (NPV; ie, a high proportion of negative tests that are true negatives). In a cohort of 334 consecutive patients, the sensitivity and specificity of this assay were 97.5 and 83.4 percent, respectively, with an NPV of 99.6 percent and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.4 percent, relative to a serotonin release assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. A meta-analysis of studies comparing rapid immunoassays found that all of these assays had high sensitivity (0.96 to 1.00), with wider variability in specificity (0.68 to 0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. In general, the sensitivity of these assays was as good as solid phase ELISA testing, and the specificity was better.</p><p>Another result that can be reported from the immunoassay is the ability of higher doses of heparin to titrate away the HIT antibody and reduce the OD. This phenomenon is based on the binding of HIT antibodies to PF4-heparin over a narrow range of heparin concentrations. In a study of 115 patients whose samples were tested in the presence of high-dose and low-dose heparin, the OD of the original ELISA using low-dose heparin and the results of high-dose heparin testing to confirm HIT antibodies (ie, to cause a &lt;50 percent reduction in the OD) was used to create a nomogram for predicting the probability of HIT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70437 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>The specificity of immunoassays can be further improved by assaying only for heparin-IgG antibodies to PF4, rather than IgM, IgG, and IgA, since IgM and IgA antibodies were shown to be less specific for diagnosing HIT in many studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/38,107,127-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,107,127-131</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8929045\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional assays test the ability of HIT antibodies from patient serum to activate test platelets, which more strongly correlates with the presence of the HIT syndrome than the results of an immunoassay.

However, it is not clear whether the 16 individuals with a negative SRA and a positive PEA in fact had clinically important HIT; the gold standard for HIT was defined as an intermediate probability 4 T's score plus an EIA with OD &ge;2.0, or a high probability 4 T's score plus an EIA with OD &ge;1.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>].

The distinction between HIT and other causes of thrombocytopenia can be difficult because many medical conditions and medications can cause thrombocytopenia, and heparin use in hospitalized patients is common, sometimes without being obvious (eg, as heparin flushes or in the operating room) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. The key clinical features that distinguish HIT from other causes of thrombocytopenia are the degree of thrombocytopenia, the timing relative to heparin exposure, and the rest of the clinical picture (eg, other medical disorders, medications, thrombosis).</p><p>The differential diagnosis of HIT includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, or infection</strong> &ndash; Thrombocytopenia is a common complication of severe infections, due to platelet consumption in DIC or bone marrow suppression from infection. HIT and DIC can both be accompanied by thrombosis, although patients with DIC may also have bleeding (eg, oozing from catheter sites). Unlike HIT, DIC is associated with abnormal coagulation studies (eg, prolonged PT and aPTT, low fibrinogen, elevated D-dimer). Unlike HIT, infection-associated thrombocytopenia is often accompanied by other signs of bone marrow suppression (eg, anemia, leukopenia, decreased bone marrow megakaryocytes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, previously called immune thrombocytopenic purpura) is a common autoimmune disorder. HIT and ITP are both caused by antibodies, but only HIT antibodies activate platelets and can cause thrombosis. Unlike ITP, HIT has a clear temporal relationship to heparin exposure. Laboratory testing for anti-platelet antibodies is used to diagnose HIT, but generally not for patients thought to have ITP, due to the frequent false positive and false negative testing. HIT resolves upon withdrawal of heparin, while ITP persists for months or indefinitely.

HIT and PTP are both caused by antibodies, but only HIT antibodies activate platelets and can cause thrombosis. The clinical history and laboratory testing differ for the two conditions (eg, heparin exposure, HIT antibody immunoassay for HIT; prior pregnancy, recent transfusion, human platelet antigen 1a for PTP). In those who have had a recent transfusion and exposure to heparin, distinction between HIT and PTP may depend on the presence of thrombosis or results of laboratory testing.

These include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and other TMAs associated with chemotherapeutic agents or renal transplantation. Unlike HIT, TMAs are characterized by fragmented red blood cells (ie, schistocytes) on the peripheral blood smear and microvascular rather than large vessel thrombosis. Laboratory testing for TMAs also differs from HIT, as described separately.

Unlike HIT, thrombocytopenia induced by medications or food is not associated with thrombosis. It is worth noting that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protamine sulfate</a>, used to reverse the anticoagulant effect of heparin, has also been reported to cause thrombocytopenia. Both forms of thrombocytopenia resolve upon discontinuation of the drug.

Unlike HIT, VTE is not typically associated with thrombocytopenia. HIT can be associated with VTE or arterial emboli, whereas hospitalized medical patients generally do not develop arterial emboli. Elevations in D-dimer, typically seen with VTE, are not generally seen with HIT.

Unlike in HIT, the platelet count drop after cardiopulmonary bypass usually occurs within the first 72 hours and improves thereafter. Cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a high incidence of heparin-induced antibodies without clinical HIT.

HIT and lupus-associated thrombocytopenia are both caused by antibodies; HIT antibodies activate platelets and can cause thrombosis, whereas most lupus-associated antiplatelet antibodies do not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An exception is the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which may occur in the setting of lupus or independently. APS is characterized by autoantibodies to phospholipid membranes; it is commonly accompanied by mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;50,000/microL)</span>. Like HIT, APS can be accompanied by venous and arterial thrombosis. Unlike HIT, APS antibodies interact with phospholipids (eg, cardiolipin, &szlig;2-GP-I) and cause prolongation of the aPTT.

These are typically eczematous or pruritic erythematous plaques without necrosis. As in HIT-associated skin necrosis, thrombocytopenia may be absent. Unlike HIT, these DTH reactions are not associated with thrombosis. Skin biopsy, if done, shows dermal microvascular thrombi in HIT, and lymphohistiocytic perivascular dermal infiltrate, sometimes with eosinophils, in DTH. Laboratory testing (eg, ELISA testing for PF4) can also be done to distinguish these conditions.
