The clinical presentation and initial diagnosis of bladder cancer, the rationale and overall approach to screening high-risk populations, and the approach to surveillance in patients who have been treated for non-muscle-invasive disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for bladder cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H1973563061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine biomarkers have potential applications in individuals in whom bladder cancer is suspected based upon the presence of hematuria, overactive bladder symptoms, or an unusually high risk of tumor. Urine biomarkers may also have a role in detecting recurrences in patients who have been treated for non-muscle-invasive disease. They may also be used in the evaluation of upper tract radiographic abnormalities and for monitoring patients after treatment of ureteral or renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial diagnosis &ndash; The diagnosis of bladder cancer commonly is suggested by the presence of hematuria, which may be either gross or microscopic. However, hematuria is frequently seen in a wide range of benign conditions. The diagnosis of bladder cancer ultimately requires a histologic diagnosis, which usually comes from a biopsy that is obtained at cystoscopy. Cytology may provide strong evidence for the presence of malignancy, and a positive cytology should prompt further investigation. Urine biomarkers could have a significant role in determining which individuals require cystoscopy, as well as determining those who might need evaluation of the upper urinary tract. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance &ndash; Patients who have been treated for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk for recurrence in the bladder as well as for the development of urothelial tumors in the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. These patients, thus, require prolonged follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H1973563061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cystoscopy is the gold standard for surveillance in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Because it does not detect all recurrences nor does it visualize the upper urinary tract, a biomarker test should accompany cystoscopy in order to minimize the risk of missing a high-grade tumor. Furthermore, cystoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure. Cystoscopy is easily performed in an office setting with flexible instrumentation. However, it can be uncomfortable and promote anxiety, which can lead to suboptimal compliance with management recommendations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Cystoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cytology of voided urine or bladder washings is commonly used as an adjunct to cystoscopy, particularly to detect lesions that might be missed by cystoscopy. While bladder wash urine cytology has a high sensitivity for high-grade papillary tumors and carcinoma in situ, it has relatively low sensitivity for low-grade tumors. Cytology may be complemented with another voided urine biomarker with better performance characteristics for low-grade tumors as a supplement to or in lieu of cytology as long as the biomarkers have similar performance characteristics to cytology for high-grade tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Urine cytology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">URINE BIOMARKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine is exposed to the urothelium in the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and urethra, and thus, can contain a variety of molecular markers that may be associated with neoplasia. Urine also contains cells that have been shed. These cells provide the basis for cytology, as well as newer techniques for protein and cellular analysis. A number of markers and techniques are being evaluated. Many of these are based upon immunologic detection of soluble molecules in the urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70530\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70530 \">table 1</a>). Other techniques analyze exfoliated cells that are isolated from urine or bladder washings by centrifugation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59814 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>There have been modifications to cytologic specimen preparation for exfoliated cells, including liquid-based ThinPrep technology and urine microfiltration. These may potentially allow for improved cytomorphologic evaluation and assessment of cellular biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>An ideal test to detect early urothelial neoplasia should be inexpensive, rapid, and require little or no training and no specialized instrumentation. Such a test would be both highly sensitive and specific. False-negative results can lead to a missed diagnosis and disease progression, while false-positive results cause unnecessary evaluations and associated patient anxiety. In some cases, a so-called false-positive test may be anticipatory, heralding the development of a visible tumor on subsequent evaluation.</p><p>The various approaches to develop urine biomarkers are discussed in this section. The relative performances of these tests have also been compared extensively in literature reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder tumor antigen (BTA) assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assays have been developed to detect human complement factor H-related protein (hCFHrp) in the urine. This marker is similar in composition, structure, and function to human complement factor H (hCFH). Bladder tumor antigen (BTA)-stat is a qualitative point-of-care assay, the result of which can be interpreted within five minutes. BTA-TRAK is a specialized quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The BTA assay may be particularly sensitive for detecting bladder cancer in patients with a history of schistosomiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This technology was systematically evaluated by the FinnBladder Group in 501 patients with a history of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Recurrent bladder cancer was detected by cystoscopy in 133 (27 percent). Pre-cystoscopy BTA assay was more sensitive than cytology (56 versus 19 percent) but less specific (86 versus 98 percent). In six cases in which the BTA assay was positive and cystoscopy was negative, bladder cancer was found at the next cystoscopy, and in three additional cases, upper urinary tract cancer was subsequently identified. Chou et al pointed out a higher sensitivity for evaluation of symptoms than for surveillance of tumor recurrence, while specificity was similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies consisting of 3462 patients with bladder cancer concluded that while BTA-stat has greater sensitivity than urine cytology, its specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios were relatively lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nuclear matrix protein 22</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) serve as a scaffold in the nucleus and help regulate mitosis. Several of the NMPs are overexpressed in urothelial tumors and released into the urine following apoptosis of tumor cells. NMP22 has been the most extensively evaluated NMP, and assays for this antigen are used as an aid for bladder cancer diagnosis (in patients with hematuria) and can be used to monitor for cancer recurrence following treatment.</p><p>The NMP22 assay has lower sensitivity for Ta tumors (42 to 76 percent) compared with muscle-invasive tumors (50 to 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The NMP22 test may be more sensitive for schistosomal bladder cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. The potential role of this assay has been evaluated in several trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The NMP22 assay and cytology were compared in 1331 individuals at high risk for bladder cancer, all of whom underwent diagnostic cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bladder cancer was diagnosed in 79 patients. The NMP22 assay detected 44 of these (56 percent), whereas cytology detected 12 (16 percent). While NMP22 had a lower specificity than cytology (86 versus 99 percent), it detected a bladder cancer in four cases that were missed on initial cystoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The NMP22 assay, cytology, and cystoscopy were performed in a study of 668 consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The NMP22 assay and cystoscopy detected 50 and 91 percent of the 103 recurrences, respectively. The NMP22 test detected eight of the nine cancers initially missed by cystoscopy, for a combined sensitivity of 99 percent. Cytology detected three of the nine cases initially missed at cystoscopy. The NMP22 assay had a specificity of 87 percent. In a study of 2222 patients with history of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and negative urine cytology, NMP22 levels were significantly associated with disease recurrence and progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>A prospective analysis of four commercially available urine marker tests and urine cytology for bladder cancer surveillance concluded that the combination of cytology and NMP22 seemed to increase the sensitivity for detecting high-grade tumors compared with single markers and other combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The general use of the NMP22 assay for screening high-risk populations (smokers, high-risk occupations) rather than for surveillance is more problematic because of the low prevalence of urothelial neoplasia in these populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-bladder-cancer#H3815349094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Urine biomarkers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other nuclear matrix proteins</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">NMP52</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NMP52 is a 52 kDa NMP similar to NMP22. A semiquantitative, rapid point-of-care assay has been developed to identify NMP52 in the urine of bladder cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. While performance metrics for the assay appear encouraging, there are sparse data, with most cases in the published series being limited to high-stage, high-grade tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">BLCA-4 and BLCA-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BLCA-4 and BLCA-1 are protein components of the nuclear matrix that are present exclusively in the urothelium of patients with bladder tumors and are absent in normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. BLCA-1 is expressed in bladder tumor but not adjacent normal tissues. In contrast, BLCA-4 is present throughout the bladder in both tumor and normal tissue in patients with bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Thus, BLCA-4 may reflect the field effect observed at the molecular level in normal tissues adjacent to tumors. Small studies have reported sensitivity and specificity of 80 to 96 and 87 to 100 percent, respectively, although larger prospective studies are required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282568260\"><span class=\"h2\">UroVysion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromosomal alterations in bladder cancer can be detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, in which hybridization of fluorescently labeled DNA probes to chromosome centromeres or other loci on exfoliated cells is detected with a fluorescent microscope.</p><p>The UroVysion test is a multicolor FISH assay using probes that can detect aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 7, or 17 or loss of the 9p21 locus. As marketed, the criteria for positivity are &ge;4 of 25 morphologically abnormal cells showing a gain of &ge;2 chromosomes in the same cell or &ge;12 of the 25 cells having a loss of 9p21. If neither criterion is met, additional cells are analyzed until four cells with a gain of multiple chromosomes have been detected, 12 cells with loss of 9p21 are detected, or the entire sample has been analyzed.</p><p>The sensitivity of UroVysion for bladder cancer detection varies between 69 and 87 percent, and the specificity ranges from 89 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Better performance has been reported in detecting carcinoma in situ and high-grade tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a prospective validation study on patients at risk for bladder cancer with atypical cytology, UroVysion was unnecessary when the tumor was obvious on cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, it was useful in patients with atypical cytology and equivocal or negative cystoscopy. There are some data that UroVysion may be useful for monitoring patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer for response to intravesical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. For example, patients with a positive test result at the end of treatment appear to be at higher risk for recurrence and progression to muscle-invasive disease.</p><p>UroVysion detects some occult tumors that are not visible on cystoscopy in the urine of patients under surveillance. Chromosomal abnormalities in exfoliated cells have preceded bladder tumors identifiable by cystoscopy within one year in 41 to 89 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

However, the high sensitivity of HAase was only observed for grade II and III bladder cancers. The combination of these tests resulted in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 92 and 84 percent, respectively. The sensitivities of the combined test to detect non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive tumors were 87 to 94 percent and 93 to 100 percent, respectively, while those for grade I, II, and III tumors were 86, 96, and 93 percent, respectively. Another independent study showed that the urinary HA test had an overall sensitivity of 82 percent and an overall specificity of 81 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The test suite includes assays to potentially rule out the presence of bladder cancer in low-risk patients with hematuria (Cxbladder Triage), complement cystoscopy for bladder cancer detection in the presence of hematuria (Cxbladder Detect), and complement cystoscopy for surveillance of recurrent disease (Cxbladder Monitor). The Cxbladder Triage test combines the marker panel with phenotypic characteristics of the patient; this combination had 95 percent sensitivity, compared with 86 percent for the biomarker panel alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Eighty percent of patients with microhematuria who did not have bladder cancer were correctly triaged out by the test, therefore not requiring a full urological work-up.
