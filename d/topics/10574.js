Additional testing is not indicated in an uncomplicated pregnancy. A thorough history should document underlying medical and obstetrical conditions, and physical examination should include detailed assessment of the airway. Laboratory and other testing should be performed as indicated by the patient's medical problems and the proposed surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430928420\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgently needed surgery should be performed regardless of the trimester, whereas completely elective surgery should be postponed until after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nonurgent surgery that cannot wait until delivery is generally performed during the second trimester.</p><p>There is no strong evidence of increased risk of miscarriage or teratogenesis from anesthetic agents used during early pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H431208945\" class=\"local\">'Outcome of pregnancy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1763115681\" class=\"local\">'Fetal effects of anesthetics'</a> below.)</p><p>Because common first-trimester adverse outcomes (eg, miscarriage, vaginal bleeding, fetal structural anomalies) may be attributed to surgery and anesthesia in the absence of other obvious causes, it is prudent to minimize exposure of the fetus to surgery and medication during pregnancy, especially during organogenesis. Furthermore, the safety of drug use in pregnancy cannot be conclusively evaluated.</p><p>The first-trimester background miscarriage rate is approximately 8 to 16 percent of clinically recognized pregnancies under 13 weeks of gestation, and it is 2 to 4 percent of pregnancies between 13 and 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A literature review of studies of pregnancy outcome after nonobstetric surgical intervention reported an incidence of miscarriage within this range, 10.5 percent of patients in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some studies have reported higher rates of miscarriage in women who undergo first-trimester abdominal surgery. However, it is not clear whether these higher rates were due to the surgery itself, the underlying maternal condition prompting the surgery (eg, infection, high fever), maternal characteristics (eg, smoking, older age), or other factors, such as excision of the corpus luteum early in gestation. (See <a href=\"#H430929719\" class=\"local\">'Progesterone supplementation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H431208945\" class=\"local\">'Outcome of pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p>The recommendation to perform surgery during the second rather than the third trimester is primarily mechanical: the early-second-trimester uterus is still small enough to not obliterate an abdominal operative field, and the risk of preterm labor may be lower when surgery is performed during the second trimester as compared with the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430928562\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to standard preoperative procedures, preparation of pregnant women takes into account risks of aspiration, difficult intubation, thromboembolism, and the wellbeing of the fetus. Pregnant patients also have a greater risk of carotid puncture during central venous catheterization due to the tendency of the internal jugular vein to overlie the carotid artery in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2335948461\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal heart rate monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At a minimum, the fetal heart rate should be documented pre- and postoperatively, regardless of gestational age. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has stated that the decision to use intermittent or continuous intraoperative fetal monitoring should be individualized, based on factors such as gestational age, type of surgery, and available resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The plan for intraoperative fetal heart rate monitoring and interpretation should be established preoperatively. </p><p>We suggest continuously monitoring all viable fetuses (greater than 23 to 24 weeks of gestation) throughout surgery, if technically possible. Such cases should be performed in hospitals with pediatric services appropriate for the fetal gestational age. Qualified personnel should be available to monitor and interpret the fetal heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H431208784\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative fetal heart rate monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>An obstetrician or clinician experienced in cesarean delivery should be readily available in case an emergency cesarean delivery is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is important to note that while we perform continuous monitoring when possible, continuous FHR monitoring has not been shown conclusively to improve fetal outcome in women under general anesthesia.

The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommends that patients abstain from solid food for at least six hours prior to surgery (eight hours for fried or fatty foods); clear liquids, which have a more rapid gastric transit time, may be ingested until two hours prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-of-the-pregnant-patient-at-delivery#H702937265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management of the pregnant patient at delivery&quot;, section on 'Reduce the risk of aspiration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery#H1102850532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Preparation for anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>However, this is an area of some controversy, and one author does not agree that aspiration prophylaxis is needed; as gastric emptying is not affected by pregnancy and gastric acid secretion is unchanged or decreased in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], the actual risk of aspiration appears to be small. For example, in a retrospective review of 51,086 first-trimester and 11,039 second-trimester pregnant patients undergoing deep sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, there were no cases of perioperative pulmonary aspiration even though preoperative antacids or cricoid pressure were not routinely utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of note, pregnant patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> were not candidates for deep sedation.

This effect protects against excessive blood loss at delivery, but also increases the risk of a thromboembolic event in the postsurgical period.</p><p>We place pneumatic compression devices on all pregnant women undergoing surgery. The need for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the expected scope and length of the procedure and whether the woman has risk factors for venous thrombosis in addition to the pregnancy (eg, thrombophilia, prolonged immobilization, past history of venous thrombosis, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, varicose veins, paralysis or obesity).</p><p>The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) clinical practice guideline on prevention and treatment of thrombosis recommends mechanical or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for all pregnant patients undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For laparoscopic procedures (gynecologic or general surgical) predicted to last &gt;45 minutes, use of low molecular weight heparin is suggested; mechanical thromboprophylaxis is a reasonable alternative for shorter procedures.

This decision depends upon the urgency of the surgery, and the obstetrician's estimate of whether the patient is at increased risk of preterm birth because of the underlying disease or the planned procedure. Despite the potential benefits to the fetus, however, antenatal glucocorticoids are best avoided in the setting of systemic infection (such as sepsis or a ruptured appendix), because they may impair the ability of the maternal immune system to contain the infection.

Further clinical study is required to determine the effects of prolonged or repeated exposure to anesthesia, variability among anesthetic agents and combinations of drugs, and patient factors that may confer vulnerability to anesthetic neurotoxicity. At present, there is no compelling evidence that any specific anesthetic agent should be avoided during pregnancy, or that necessary surgery should be delayed because of concerns about neurotoxicity.</p><p>In response to the FDA warning, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recognized the limitations of available data and reaffirmed that necessary surgery should not be delayed during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751840853\"><span class=\"h4\">Teratogenicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anesthetic agents have no known teratogenic effects, and multiple large retrospective studies have not shown an increase in congenital defects in infants born to mothers who had surgery and anesthesia during pregnancy, including the 2252 pregnancies with first-trimester exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/1,67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,67-71</a>].

The surgical approach (laparotomy or laparoscopy) should be based on the skills of the surgeon, surgical needs and goals, and the availability of the appropriate staff and equipment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a laparotomy is performed, the type of incision depends on the surgical procedure and gestational age.

Between seven and nine weeks of gestation, luteal support is shifted from the corpus luteum of the ovary to the placenta (called the luteoplacental shift); therefore, after nine weeks, progesterone supplementation to replace corpus luteum progesterone production is no longer needed.</p><p>A small, seminal study showed that removal of the corpus luteum up to 47 days of pregnancy (dating by last menstrual period) resulted in a high rate of abortion; however, removal of the corpus luteum after 61 days only resulted in a transient decrease in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>, without a high rate of abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Major birth defects following first-trimester surgery occurred in 3.9 percent (in those reporting by trimester), but the increased rate of defects was not statistically significant in any individual study, and not felt to be significantly increased over the general obstetrical population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of delivery related to surgery was 3.5 percent (79 of 2282); it was impossible to determine whether the cause was the procedure itself or the underlying condition. The prematurity rate in the reviewed articles was 8.2 percent (597 of 7313).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetal loss rate was 2.5 percent in non-registry studies and ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 percent in registry studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following appendectomy, patients had higher rates of surgery-related delivery (4.6 percent) compared with other operations (0.8 percent). There were also higher rates of fetal loss (2.6 percent), increasing when peritonitis was present (10.9 percent) compared with other operations (1.2 percent).</p><p/><p>The largest study of surgery during pregnancy in this review included 720,000 pregnant Swedish women, of whom 5405 underwent surgery in the 1970s and 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These findings suggest surgery and anesthesia are not associated with teratogenic effects in early pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rates of low birthweight infants (due to prematurity and growth restriction) and early neonatal death (death within seven days of birth) were significantly increased in women who had had surgery (for low birthweight, relative risk [RR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.2, and for early neonatal death, RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6-2.7). It is not clear whether this increase resulted from the procedure itself or from an effect of the underlying medical condition necessitating surgery.</p><p/><p>A subsequent retrospective review attempted to quantify the impact of non-obstetric surgery on pregnancy outcome. After evaluating over 47,000 non-obstetric surgeries identified from nearly 6.5 million pregnancies, the authors estimated that every 287 procedures were associated with one additional stillbirth, every 31 surgeries were associated with one additional preterm birth, every 39 operations were associated with one additional low birth-weight infant, and every 25 surgeries were associated with one additional cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

However, as delaying non-elective surgical intervention increases the risks of complications, particularly for infection and venous thromboembolism, pregnant women who require surgical procedures are advised to proceed and avoid delay.</p><p>A retrospective cohort study that matched over 2500 United States pregnant women to non-pregnant controls undergoing general surgical procedures reported no differences in the 30-day mortality rates (0.4 versus 0.3 percent) and morbidity rates (6.6 versus 7.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Although the pregnant women were more likely to have emergent surgery compared with non-pregnant controls (51 versus 13 percent), the rates of poor outcomes were not increased. The increased morbidity typically associated with emergency surgery may have been ameliorated by the significantly younger age of the pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women (30 versus 53 years). It is not known if this finding would be the same in a cohort of older pregnant women. The study is consistent with prior data indicating that non-elective general surgical procedures can be safely done in pregnant women and therefore should not be delayed because of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. In contrast, a different cohort study of over 5500 pregnant women in Taiwan reported a nearly 4-fold increased rate of in-hospital maternal mortality (time period not specified), a 2.5-fold increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit, and increased risks of postoperative septicemia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection for pregnant women undergoing nonobstetric surgery compared with non-pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In this study, nearly half the women were younger than 30 years of age. The amount of time elapsed until surgery was not reported. It is not known if the differences in outcomes between the two cohort studies reflect differences in the study designs, populations, care protocols, or other factors. </p><p>While the available data on the risk of surgery in pregnant women are conflicting, surgical delay has been linked to worsened outcomes, particularly for infectious surgical indications such as appendicitis and cholecystitis. As an example, a study of over 7100 women with appendicitis in pregnancy reported that conservative medical management was associated with an increased risk of septic shock (adjusted odds ratio 6.3), venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio 2.5), and peritonitis (adjusted odds ratio 1.6) compared with appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Similarly, in a study of pregnant women with cholecystitis, women managed surgically had lower maternal complication rates (4 versus 16 percent) and fetal complication rates (6 versus 16 percent) compared with women treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic and anatomic changes related to pregnancy require adaptations of anesthetic and surgical techniques.
