Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD also known as new variant CJD), Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), one of a number of prion infections affecting animals, was responsible for bringing these agents to more widespread public attention with its possible link to vCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>These human prion diseases share certain common neuropathologic features including neuronal loss, proliferation of glial cells, absence of an inflammatory response, and the presence of small vacuoles within the neuropil, which produces a spongiform appearance. The current theory is that prion diseases are associated with the accumulation of an abnormal form of a host cell protein, the normal form is designated PrPc, and the abnormal form is designated PrPSc (for Scrapie) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the prion diseases Kuru, GSS, and FFI will be reviewed here. CJD and variant CJD are discussed separately.

The cessation of these practices in the 1950s had been thought to end incident cases of kuru; however, increased active surveillance in Papua New Guinea led to the identification of 11 new cases of kuru between July 1996 and June 2004, with a likely incubation period of more than 50 years in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Kuru also remains important because of some overlapping clinical and pathologic features with iatrogenic CJD, vCJD, and GSS that provide clues to the pathogenesis of other human prion diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike some of the other prion diseases such as CJD, kuru occurs in predictable stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The early or ambulatory phase is characterized by tremors, ataxia, and postural instability. The tremors resemble shivering, which accounts for the name of the disease (kuru = shivering). The sedentary stage follows as the disease progresses with loss of ambulation resulting from increased tremors and ataxia. Involuntary movements, including myoclonus, choreoathetosis, and fasciculations, also appear. Dementia, which usually begins as slowing of the mental processes, progresses in the late stages of the disease. Patients may exhibit indifference or seem unconcerned with their disease. Frontal release signs, cerebellar type dysarthria, and inability to get out of bed mark the terminal stage, with death typically due to pneumonia occurring within 9 to 24 months from the onset of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few laboratory studies have been performed on patients with kuru, and neuroimaging has not been reported. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is unremarkable. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is abnormal, but it is not characterized by the periodic sharp wave complexes found in some of the other human prion diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While limited molecular genetic studies of patients with kuru have been undertaken, no mutations in the prion protein (PRNP) gene have been reported. Homozygosity at the polymorphic codon 129 of the PRNP gene has been detected at a higher than expected frequency in kuru and also in patients with iatrogenic CJD, sporadic CJD, and vCJD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Individuals who were exposed to kuru and survived the epidemic were usually heterozygotes at a known resistance factor site at codon 129. A genetic study undertaken in Papua, New Guinea identified a novel PRNP variant, G127V, which appeared to confer protection from kuru among geographically and genetically at risk families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The fact that this allele was found exclusively in individuals from a kuru-prevalent geographic region indicates that this is an acquired genetic response through selection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic hallmark of kuru is PrPSc-reactive plaques occurring with the greatest frequency in the cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Kuru plaques are unicentric and round with radiating spicules and are periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive. Neuronal loss and hypertrophy of astrocytes is also observed</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GERSTMANN-STR&Auml;USSLER-SCHEINKER SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) is a rare human prion disease with an incidence of 1 to 10 cases per 100 million population per year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GSS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with virtual complete penetrance. At least 24 separate kindreds have been identified throughout the world.</p><p>The hallmark of the clinical disease is progressive cerebellar degeneration accompanied by differing degrees of dementia in patients entering midlife (mean age 43 to 48 years), although the onset of symptoms in older patients has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. The course of the illness typically advances for approximately five years before culminating in death. Cerebellar manifestations include clumsiness, incoordination, and gait ataxia. Dysesthesia, hyporeflexia, and proximal weakness in the legs are also early signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Myoclonus is typically absent in GSS. Whether and to what degree dementia ensues varies among affected families and individuals within the same family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Part of the variability of expression of this illness may be due to differences in the underlying PRNP mutation or the associated polymorphisms in codon 129. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of GSS cannot be made from laboratory or imaging studies. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is normal in GSS. The electroencephalogram (EEG) may show slowing, but does not typically show the periodic sharp wave complexes characteristic of sporadic CJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalogram'</a>.) The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not specific or sensitive but may show areas of decreased T2 signal in the striatum and midbrain in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may demonstrate diffusely decreased blood flow; in one study, findings on SPECT that were very sensitive for GSS early in the disease course included decreased flow in the occipital lobe and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Demonstration of PRNP gene mutations appears to be a sensitive and highly specific way to diagnose GSS since the vast majority of cases are familial, and all patients with definite GSS have been found to have PRNP mutations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.) Neuropathology can be useful, and immunostaining of brain tissue for PrPSc is positive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GSS displays neuropathologic features consistent with other forms of human prion diseases. However, the presence of kuru-like plaques in highest density in the cerebellum but also elsewhere in the brain is a common finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These plaques are often multicentric with radiating spicules and are accompanied by microglial changes; they stain for PrPSc and are PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) positive. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, identical to those seen in Alzheimer disease, have been seen in brains from several kindreds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FATAL FAMILIAL INSOMNIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) was first identified in Italian families, but kindreds have now been reported throughout the world. Sporadic cases are also described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. FFI results from a missense mutation at codon 178 of the PRNP gene located on chromosome 20p13.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FFI is a rapidly fatal disease with a mean duration of 13 months, which generally occurs in midlife, median age at onset 56 years (range 23 to 73 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Disease onset is earlier and duration is shorter in those who are homozygous for methionine at codon 129. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-genetics-of-prions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and genetics of prions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients characteristically develop progressive insomnia with loss of the normal circadian sleep-activity pattern, which may manifest as a dream-like confusional state during waking hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Mental status and behavioral changes include inattention, impaired concentration and memory, confusion, and hallucinations, but overt dementia is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As the disease progresses, motor disturbances such as myoclonus, ataxia, Parkinsonism and spasticity can occur along with dysarthria and dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/30,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32-34</a>]. Methionine-homozygous patients are more likely to have hallucinations and myoclonus as prominent disease features, while methionine-heterozygous patients are more likely to develop early and more severe problems with ataxia, bulbar signs, and nystagmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34</a>].</p><p>Dysautonomia and endocrine disturbances can occur; among the prion disease, these are unique to FFI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/28,33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33,35</a>]. Dysautonomia may induce hyperhidrosis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension. Endocrine disturbances include decreases in ACTH secretion, increases in cortisol secretion, and loss of the normal diurnal variations in levels of growth hormone, melatonin, and prolactin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing and routine imaging with CT or MRI are not helpful in making the diagnosis of FFI.

EEGs do not show periodic sharp wave complexes, and MRI shows no distinctive abnormalities. Fluorodeoxyglucose PET has been reported to show decreased glucose utilization in the thalamus, which may be detectable even before the development of clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].

Patients presented at a mean of 62 years with a dementia with prominent neuropsychiatric manifestations and progressive motor decline (ataxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parkinsonism). Death followed symptoms onset within a mean of 20 months. A family history of dementia was present in seven patients, suggesting a possible genetic origin. CSF 14-3-3 was negative in the five patients in whom it was tested, MRI demonstrated diffuse atrophy without restricted diffusion, and EEGs were normal or showed only diffuse slowing. Neuropathologic examination revealed spongiform degeneration in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus with relative sparing of the brainstem and cerebellum. There was a similar anatomic distribution of PrP immunostaining that was characterized by a distinctive pattern of cluster-forming granules. Immunoreactivity was virtually abolished by protein digestion. All 11 of these cases had the 129VV genotype. A similar case in the Netherlands was reported subsequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>A case series of 15 additional cases were reported in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. While six cases had the 129VV genotype as in the original 11, three were 129MM, and six were 129MV. Clinical features were similar across genotypes; distinguishing features included a longer mean disease duration (45 months) and older age of onset (72 years) among those with the 129MV genotype compared with the other two groups. Patients with the 129MM phenotype had less severe or absent neuropsychiatric symptoms. The prion proteins associated with the 129MV and 129MM genotypes are also relatively protease resistant compared to those associated with the 129VV genotype. Three new cases have been reported in 2013; two 129VV and one 129MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In this report, the investigators noted that low levels of abnormal protease-resistant prion protein resistant fragments were found in some sCJD cases with typical Western blots, and, conversely, that forms of the abnormal protein found in typical sCJD were found in some brain areas of variable protease-sensitive prionopathy cases.

In a European study, 28 patients with CJD were randomly assigned to treatment with flupirtine (n=13) or placebo (n = 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. One patient in each group had familial CJD, the remainder were sporadic cases. Diagnosis was based upon the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for &quot;probable&quot; CJD. Flupirtine treatment was initiated at 100 mg per day, and increased over three days to a maintenance dose of 300 to 400 mg per day, which was continued for a median treatment duration of 29 days. There was no significant effect of flupirtine treatment on survival time compared with placebo. However, the patients treated with flupirtine performed significantly better on the cognitive part of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog). Flupirtine-treated patients also did better on the Mini Mental Status Examination, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Caregiver's impressions were also significantly better in the flupirtine-treated group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Chlorpromazine and quinacrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific derivatives of acridine and phenothiazine were found to inhibit PrPSc formation in a cultured neuroblastoma cell line (ScN2a) chronically infected with prions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diseases-of-the-central-nervous-system-caused-by-prions/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD also known as new variant CJD), Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kuru, which was endemic in Papua New Guinea among the Fore tribes, is felt to be transmitted from person to person by ritual cannibalism (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Kuru'</a> above.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms begin with tremors, ataxia, and postural instability, followed by loss of ambulation and involuntary movements. Dementia progresses in the late stages of the disease, with death typically occurring within 9 to 24 months from the onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diagnostic testing has not been well characterized in this disorder. Characteristic pathologic findings have been described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with virtual complete penetrance (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker Syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In midlife, affected patients develop a progressive cerebellar degeneration accompanied by differing degrees of dementia. Death usually occurs within five years after the onset of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A diagnosis of GSS cannot be made from the usual laboratory or imaging studies. Demonstration of PRNP gene mutations appears to be a sensitive and highly specific way to diagnose GSS. Neuropathology can also be useful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rapidly fatal disease with a mean duration of 13 months, which generally occurs in midlife, median age at onset is 56 years. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Fatal familial insomnia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients characteristically develop progressive insomnia with loss of the normal circadian pattern. Mental status and behavioral changes include inattention, impaired concentration and memory, confusion, and hallucinations, but overt dementia is rare. As the disease progresses, motor disturbances such as myoclonus, ataxia, and spasticity can occur, along with dysautonomia and endocrine disturbances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A diagnosis of FFI cannot be made from the usual laboratory or imaging studies. Genetic studies are the diagnostic procedure of choice. Neuropathological studies do not show typical spongiform findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most frequent of the human prion diseases. CJD most often occurs as a sporadic disorder although familial forms have been described. It is clinically manifest by a rapidly progressive mental deterioration, often with behavioral abnormalities, and myoclonus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variant CJD is a distinct disorder that represents bovine-to-human transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, most patients acquiring the disorder through ingestion of infected meat products. Clinical, diagnostic and pathologic features are distinct from CJD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variant-creutzfeldt-jakob-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No effective treatment has been identified for human prion diseases, which are universally fatal.
