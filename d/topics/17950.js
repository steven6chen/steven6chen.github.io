Either a symptom or peak flow based plan may be used; although evidence shows similar benefits, patients who are poor perceivers of dyspnea may benefit from a plan based on objective measure of airflow limitation. We frequently provide a prescription for a short course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (eg, 40 mg daily for five days) for patients to keep on hand and to start based on specific criteria in their action plan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What do patients need to know about their asthma?&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may still not know how to use their inhalers correctly despite a long history of asthma; each patient's technique should be observed and correct technique carefully demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Compliance/adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Compliance/adherence</span> to medications should be addressed at each visit, in partnership with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are many reasons for nonadherence. Strategies to maintain adherence can be discussed while developing the action plan. If a medication is not subjectively or objectively improving the patient's symptoms or respiratory function after a three month trial, it should be stopped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhancing-patient-adherence-to-asthma-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhancing patient adherence to asthma therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Controlling asthma triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ongoing exposure to asthma triggers is an important cause of poor asthma control in some patients. For patients with severe asthma who have no allergic component to their disease, allergen control measures will have little effect. Potential triggers that are identified during evaluation (eg, pets, dust mites, workplace exposures, tobacco smoke) need renewed strategies for control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58870\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58870 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a regimen has been developed, we usually request that patients with severe asthma return for follow up visits at four to eight week intervals. We evaluate control using standardized questions, either the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or Asthma Control Test (ACT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50620\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef50620 \">form 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Objective measures of airflow limitation (eg, peak expiratory flow, spirometry) are important; spirometry may need to be performed more frequently than in patients with milder asthma. In particular, we perform spirometry when there is a significant change in clinical status and to confirm that a step-down in medication has not caused a clinically-silent decline in lung function. Spirometry may also have utility in comparing the efficacy of various add-on controller agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SHORT-ACTING BETA AGONISTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled short acting beta agonists (SABAs) should be prescribed for the relief of acute symptoms. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Albuterol</a>, at a dose of 2 to 4 puffs, is commonly prescribed, although other equivalent agents are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72467 \">table 5</a>). This dose may be repeated twice within an hour if needed for an acute exacerbation. SABAs should only be used on an as needed basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-agonists-in-asthma-acute-administration-and-prophylactic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta agonists in asthma: Acute administration and prophylactic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with severe asthma derive better symptom relief from nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, compared with the metered dose preparation. Patients should be advised to seek emergency department evaluation, if they are unimproved after two home nebulizer treatments within an hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATING CONTROLLER THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients presenting with symptoms and objective measures consistent with National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) and&nbsp;Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) definitions of &quot;severe persistent asthma&quot; are not on controller therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. With addition of controller medication, many will improve enough that they do not meet American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria for severe asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68983 \">table 1</a>). This section will describe our approach to patients who meet <span class=\"nowrap\">NAEPP/GINA</span> criteria for &quot;severe persistent asthma&quot; at their initial visit.</p><p>Initial controller agents for severe persistent asthma include oral and inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs), and long acting beta agonists. Generally, combination therapy with two or more controller agents will be needed to achieve improved control in patients with severe persistent asthma.</p><p>Achieving the usual goals of asthma treatment (prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, normalize pulmonary function, maintain normal activity levels, prevent exacerbations, improve health-related quality of life, and provide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects) may not be fully possible in patients with severe asthma. It may be necessary to accept some degree of reduced activity and persistent airflow limitation, and to focus instead on reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations and hospitalizations, avoiding further loss of pulmonary function, and limiting toxicity from medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who are not on any controller medication and meet GINA criteria for step 4 therapy or NAEPP criteria for &quot;severe persistent asthma&quot; will need an initial, brief course of oral GC therapy to bring their asthma under control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56729 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In deciding when to prescribe oral GC, we consider the severity of symptoms, degree of airflow limitation, and whether symptoms have been stable or worsening. In general, we prescribe a brief course of an oral GC to patients with frequent daytime or nocturnal symptoms, recent deterioration (eg, increased need for short acting beta agonists [SABAs]), or a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) less than 60 percent of predicted. The treatment of acute asthma exacerbations is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A reevaluation in two weeks will assess the response to therapy and determine the need for longer term, low dose oral GC versus transition to inhaled GC alone.</p><p>A two to three week course of oral GC may also be considered in patients who have baseline stable airflow obstruction that does not reverse with inhaled bronchodilator. In this way, the degree of reversibility to GCs can be determined. The FEV<sub>1</sub> at the end of the trial may be used as a goal for ongoing controller therapy, instead of the usual target of 80 percent of the predicted value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhaled glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled GCs (called inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] in the NHLBI guidelines) that are high potency and used at a high dose are the foundation of long term controller therapy in severe asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78011 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68143 \">table 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2,5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,8,9</a>]. Several formulations are available; we usually choose one from the &quot;high potency&quot; group that allows for the least number of puffs per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The dose of inhaled GC is adjusted at subsequent visits based on asthma control. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Adjusting controller therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination inhaled GC/LABA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with severe asthma are treated with a combination of inhaled GC and a LABA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a>, or vilanterol) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68143 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2,3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Combination inhaled GC/LABA'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUSTING CONTROLLER THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a patient who presents with severe asthma is receiving controller therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs) and a long acting beta agonist (LABA), subsequent visits are usually scheduled at four to eight week intervals. At these visits, therapy is adjusted based upon an assessment of asthma control and any adverse effects of medication, remembering that the degree of asthma control is determined by the most severe indicator of impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65972 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Patients who fail to achieve asthma control on inhaled GC doses around the equivalent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> 800 to 1000 mcg per day, or who have difficulty tapering oral GCs, should be reassessed for accuracy of the diagnosis, lack of adherence, ongoing exposure to asthma triggers, and comorbid conditions.</p><p>If severe asthma is confirmed, based on American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68983 \">table 1</a>), explanations for persistent symptoms despite high dose combination therapy include: residual inflammation is relatively GC resistant, remodeling (not inflammation) is causing airflow limitation, and inflammation in the distal airways is not reached by the inhaled GCs. At this point, we consider several choices, which are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trying a course of oral GC or an injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Experimental approaches'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-agents-for-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational agents for asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Referral to an asthma specialist is suggested for all patients with this degree of asthma severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral GCs are the most potent and effective controller agent for asthma, but have substantial side effects when used for months to years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2,3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,11</a>]. We always try to use the lowest dose of oral GC for the shortest duration possible, because of the side effects of systemic GCs. We use high dose inhaled GC, LABA, and other controller medications to maintain asthma control and allow tapering of oral GC, because these other controller medications have fewer systemic effects.</p><p>When a patient has frequent exacerbations despite high doses of inhaled GCs, it is helpful to determine whether the patient's asthma is actually responsive to GCs. This can be accomplished with injection of a long acting GC, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. With this approach, <span class=\"nowrap\">adherence/compliance</span> is no longer an issue. In a randomized trial, patients with a high level of lung eosinophils, despite high dose inhaled (and even oral) GCs, responded to 3 mL (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> of intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide with improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), reduced rescue medication, and decreased lung eosinophils when assessed two weeks later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients who respond to triamcinolone are not steroid resistant, but rather poorly adherent or poorly steroid responsive, requiring very high doses of GC that may be associated with substantial side effects. After intramuscular triamcinolone, the anti-inflammatory effect and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression last for about two to six weeks. It is reasonable to reassess symptom control and spirometry in three to four weeks.</p><p>Patients who fail to respond to systemic GCs may rarely have GC resistant asthma. For clinical purposes, this is defined by a FEV<sub>1</sub> that is less than 75 percent of predicted and fails to improve by 15 percent after a two week trial of oral GC (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 mg per day). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-and-clinical-implications-of-glucocorticoid-resistance-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms and clinical implications of glucocorticoid resistance in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consideration should be given to daily low dose oral GCs (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> when bursts of oral GCs are required every two to three months despite high dose inhaled GC, long acting inhaled beta agonist, and trials of other controller agents described below. The lowest possible daily dose should be used.</p><p>Patients on chronic oral GC need to be monitored for GC side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhaled glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled GCs have broad anti-inflammatory effects in asthma and are effective in many patients with severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/2,3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,14,15</a>]. They have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms; improve peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), spirometry, and quality of life; diminish airway hyperresponsiveness; and prevent or reduce the frequency of exacerbations. We usually use a high potency GC that allows for the least number of puffs per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When asthma is not well controlled on high dose inhaled GC (eg, about 1000 mcg per day), but appears to be GC responsive, we consider a further increase in dose or use of an inhaled GC with a smaller particle size. The evidence for increasing the dose of inhaled GC above 1000 mcg per day is limited and not all patients will improve with higher inhaled GC doses. As an example, a double blind, parallel group study of 671 patients with severe asthma found slightly greater efficacy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> 2 mg per day compared to fluticasone 1 mg per day or to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> 1.6 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Outcome measures were morning peak flow, rescue medication, daily symptom scores and diurnal peak flow variation. However, systemic GC side effects are likely to occur in this dose range.</p><p>Some of the currently available inhaled GCs are delivered in aerosols of a particle size that do not reach the distal airways. Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-beclomethasone has a particle size of approximately one micron, which enhances its delivery to the distal airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although evidence is lacking, adding an HFA or other small particle size formulation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> DPI) of inhaled GCs to a traditional <span class=\"nowrap\">GC/LABA</span> combination preparation (eg, 160 to 320 mcg of inhaled GC at midday in addition to the twice daily dosing of a combination product) may improve measures of small airway disease, and perhaps clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Monitoring for GC related side effects is appropriate for patients on chronic high dose inhaled GC.
