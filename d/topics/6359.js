Other histologic types of epithelial ovarian cancer include endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. Some experts have proposed that serous carcinomas all originate in the fallopian tubes. This is based upon studies that detected fallopian tubal intraepithelial carcinoma in the fimbria of <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers following risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The role of this neoplasm in subsequent progression to invasive cancer of the ovary, peritoneum, or fallopian tube has been suggested but not proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Traditionally, two main hypotheses were proposed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incessant ovulation</strong> &ndash; Repeated ovulation results in minor trauma to the ovarian epithelium, which in turn can lead to malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Support for this hypothesis is derived from the observation that women with periodic suppression of ovulation as a result of oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, or lactation have a lower incidence of epithelial ovarian carcinoma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exposure to gonadotropins</strong> &ndash; Persistent ovarian exposure to gonadotropins and elevated estradiol concentrations may be carcinogenic. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that experimentally induced ovarian tumors contain gonadotropin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By contrast, evidence shows that a history of a multiple gestation is associated with a decreased risk of EOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. According to the gonadotropic hypothesis, women with a history of multiple gestations should be at increased risk of EOC because they have higher levels of gonadotropins during their fertile years and they have a greater incidence of double ovulations per menstrual cycle. Furthermore, one case-control study failed to demonstrate a relationship between serum levels of luteinizing hormone and the risk of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Evidence suggests that fallopian tubal neoplasia may also play a role in the pathogenesis of EOC and peritoneal cancer, as discussed above. The proportion of cases of these carcinomas that are initiated in the fallopian tubes is a topic of investigation. (See <a href=\"#H6091373\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal serous carcinomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk factors for fallopian tubal and peritoneal carcinoma are less well defined than for EOC, but they have generally been found to be the same.

The annual incidence of ovarian cancer in the United States is 12.7 per 100,000 women. The lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in the general population is 1.4 percent.
