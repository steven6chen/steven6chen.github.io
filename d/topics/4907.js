Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Ulcerative colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by relapsing and remitting episodes of inflammation limited to the <strong>mucosal layer of the colon</strong>. It almost invariably involves the rectum and typically extends in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon. Different terms have been used to describe the degree of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcerative proctitis refers to disease limited to the rectum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcerative proctosigmoiditis refers to disease limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon and not involving the descending colon</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left-sided or distal ulcerative colitis is defined as disease that extends beyond the rectum and as far proximally as the splenic flexure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive colitis refers to disease extending proximal to the splenic flexure but sparing the cecum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancolitis is used when the inflammatory process extends throughout the colon to the cecum</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Crohn disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crohn disease is characterized by <strong>transmural</strong> inflammation and by <strong>skip lesions</strong>. The transmural inflammatory nature of Crohn disease may lead to fibrosis and strictures, and to obstructive clinical presentations that are not typically seen in ulcerative colitis. More commonly, the transmural inflammation results in sinus tracts, giving rise to microperforations and fistulae.</p><p>Crohn disease may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract from mouth to perianal area. The most commonly affected area is the ileum and proximal colon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease have been subclassified based on their clinical presentation, severity of disease (mild, moderate, severe), phenotype (Crohn disease: inflammatory, stricturing, penetrating), location (see list above) and extent of involvement. This has provided a uniform framework for studies evaluating the genetic, serologic, and clinical factors that predict the evolution of these diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86283 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86284\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86284 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531100387\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2971313422\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In North America, incidence rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) range from 2.2 to 19.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for ulcerative colitis and 3.1 to 20.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one of the largest studies, based upon nine million health insurance claims, the prevalence of ulcerative colitis in adults in the United States was 238 per 100,000 population and the prevalence of Crohn disease was 201 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The incidence and prevalence of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) appear to be lower in Asia and the Middle East , however, in some newly industrialized countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, the incidence of IBD has been rising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. In a large systematic review of population-based studies on the incidence of Crohn disease and UC, the following temporal trends were noted: in Brazil, the annual percentage change (APC) increased for Crohn disease by 11.1 percent (95% CI 4.8-17.8) and for UC by 14.9 percent (95% CI 10.4-19.6), and in Taiwan, the APC increased for Crohn disease by 4 percent (95 percent 1.0 to 7.1) and for UC by 4.8 percent (1.8 to 8.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4129326455\"><span class=\"h2\">Trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trends in the incidence of IBD have been reported based on sex, age, geographic and seasonal variation.

Seasonal variation in flares of IBD (with peaks in the spring) has been suggested in some reports; however, the magnitude of the association, if any, is weak, and discordant data have also been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531113796\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear, a number of risk factors have been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531113302\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age of onset of most cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease is between 15 and 40 years.

It is not clear whether this second peak relates to greater susceptibility to disease with increased age, the late expression of an earlier environmental exposure, or misdiagnosis of ischemic colitis as IBD. </p><p>There appear to be small differences in IBD incidence by gender. In general, there is a slight female predominance in Crohn disease, although in some low incidence areas a male predominance exists. The female predominance, especially among women in late adolescence and early adulthood, suggests that hormonal factors may play a role in disease expression. In contrast, there may be a slight male predominance in ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531113309\"><span class=\"h2\">Racial and ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are more common in Jews than non-Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

In a large prospective cohort study of 229,111 women, the risk of ulcerative colitis was similar in current smokers as compared with those who had never smoked, while former smokers had an increased risk of ulcerative colitis as compared with those who had never smoked (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The risk of ulcerative colitis increased two years after cessation of smoking and persisted for over 20 years.

As an example, a case control study included over 3000 patients with incident IBD and over 11,600 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. After excluding patients who had acute gastroenteritis within six months of IBD diagnosis and adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of IBD was significantly increased in patients with a prior episode of acute gastroenteritis (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2-1.7). There was also an approximate fivefold increase in IBD risk in individuals with a previous diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if this association between IBS and IBD was due to IBS-like symptoms in patients with undiagnosed IBD, or if IBS actually predisposes individuals to the development of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. However, when individuals with a prior IBS diagnosis were excluded from the analysis, the association between acute enteric infection and IBD persisted.</p><p>An increased risk of developing IBD was also found in a population-based cohort study of 13,148 patients with documented Salmonella or Campylobacter gastroenteritis when compared with a matched control group (1.2 versus 0.5 percent, HR 2.9, 95% CI 2.2-3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-risk-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].
