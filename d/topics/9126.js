The elevated triglyceride levels fall following treatment of the diabetes. In a patient with both diabetes and familial hypertriglyceridemia, the triglyceride level before treatment reflects the combined effects of untreated diabetes and familial hypertriglyceridemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With treatment of the diabetes, the triglyceride level decreases to a lower but still elevated value, resembling those of affected hypertriglyceridemic relatives without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this setting, treatment of diabetes unmasks the familial hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>In the usual patient with type 2 diabetes, the fasting triglyceride level is in the 200 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> range. When the triglyceride level is higher and especially when it is much higher, it is probable that the hypertriglyceridemia has additional causes. Other known causes of hypertriglyceridemia should be sought, including a high-fat diet; ethanol use or abuse; medications such as estrogens and glucocorticoids; and other medical causes such as hypothyroidism, the nephrotic syndrome, and inherited forms of hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>In the patient described in this case, the initial triglyceride level of 1118 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was too high to be attributed to type 2 diabetes alone. The history and initial laboratory tests excluded the other common causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, the patient probably has two disorders, type 2 diabetes and a familial form of hypertriglyceridemia such as familial hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>At the time of initial evaluation, the patient needed treatment of the uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, treatment of hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis, and assessment of his lipid cardiovascular risk factors. It is usually not possible to address all of these issues simultaneously. In this situation, it is generally appropriate to provide nutritional counseling for both diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia and to treat the diabetes before introducing pharmacologic treatment of the hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>It was not possible to calculate the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level in this patient initially because this calculation is inaccurate when the triglyceride level exceeds 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Some of the elevation of the serum cholesterol level in patients with hypertriglyceridemia reflects the cholesterol in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). For this reason and because the triglyceride level will fall in response to treatment of the diabetes, it is not possible to determine a lipid profile to serve as a baseline for the effects of pharmacologic lipid-lowering agents. The reduction of the triglyceride level will be associated with some fall in the cholesterol level, depending in part on the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein that is involved. Statins are not likely to have a clinically important lipid-lowering effect at very high triglyceride levels.</p><p>Assays are available that measure the LDL cholesterol level directly. An alternative approach would have been to order a direct measurement of the LDL cholesterol level when the triglyceride level was &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. However, some direct assays of LDL cholesterol provide appreciably different results than the estimated LDL value, even in patients with triglyceride values &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Treatment guidelines for hypercholesterolemia are based on the estimated LDL cholesterol value (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-blood-lipids-and-lipoproteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of blood lipids and lipoproteins&quot;</a>). In patients with diabetes, measures that reduce the triglyceride level may also decrease the LDL cholesterol. For these reasons, it is preferable to treat the diabetes and reduce the triglyceride level below 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> rapidly and then to determine the estimated LDL cholesterol level. A direct measurement of the LDL cholesterol may be helpful if it is not possible to achieve a prompt reduction in the triglyceride level.</p><p>The patient under consideration was willing to make a concerted effort to improve his diet, and he did so in large part. Initial treatment with a low saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet with reduced portions at meals including those of carbohydrates reduced the triglyceride level, which nevertheless remained elevated, but failed to control the diabetes. Although the patient's food choices improved, he did not lose weight. Weight loss may have a powerful impact on triglyceride levels and glucose control. Treatment with insulin established control of the diabetes and further reduced the triglyceride level, which nevertheless remained elevated. At that point, the patient's lipid pattern was most consistent with familial hypertriglyceridemia, with a high triglyceride level and only modest elevations of the total and LDL cholesterol values.</p><p>At the time of the initial evaluation, the patient's diabetes was uncontrolled and had not responded to two oral diabetic medications. It would have been reasonable to start insulin at that time, along with medical nutrition therapy, to control the diabetes and correct the hypertriglyceridemia more rapidly. Because of the patient's determination to adhere to a diet and a program of close medical follow-up, insulin was not initially started. This case history demonstrates what can and cannot be achieved with diet in the treatment of uncontrolled diabetes and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin was initiated one month after the initial evaluation. This brief delay demonstrated to the patient that diet was important but not sufficient. In general, the initiation of insulin should not be delayed when medical nutrition therapy and oral diabetic agents fail to control type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Human genetic studies demonstrate that elevated triglyceride levels increase the risk of coronary heart disease to an extent comparable with the effect of LDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This suggests that pharmacologic reduction of triglyceride rich lipoproteins will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, but this has not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The treatment of triglyceride levels in the 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> range in diabetic patients is discretionary. If one chooses to treat, treatment options include omega-3 fatty acids, a fibric acid derivative, and a statin. Comparative data are not available, and the choice should depend upon the risks and benefits of each agent as they apply to the individual patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertriglyceridemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertriglyceridemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Omega-3 fatty acids are effective in reducing the triglyceride level in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as in nondiabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Omega-3 fatty acids do not have a deleterious effect on circulating glucose and lipoprotein levels in doses up to 3 grams a day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the Nurses' Health Study, a higher consumption of fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was associated with a lower incidence of coronary heart disease and total mortality in diabetic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Fish and fish oils can prevent cardiovascular disease and sudden death in the general population and improve cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Fibric acid derivatives reduce triglyceride levels. They also produce modest decreases in LDL cholesterol levels and modest increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Statins are appealing because of their proven benefit in preventing cardiovascular disease and increasing life expectancy in nondiabetic and diabetic patients.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-14-a-41-year-old-man-with-type-2-diabetes-and-hypertriglyceridemia-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brunzell JD, Hazzard WR, Motulsky AG, Bierman EL.
