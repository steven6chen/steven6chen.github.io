Once the medication is discontinued or if treatment is interrupted for a sufficient period of time, the patient's hypersensitivity to the medication returns. Desensitization is only safe and effective for certain types of drug allergy. The terms &quot;drug hypersensitivity&quot; and &quot;drug allergy&quot; are used synonymously in this topic review.</p><p>Techniques for drug desensitization in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions and the proposed mechanisms underlying these techniques will be reviewed here. Desensitizations for reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are <strong>not</strong> included in this discussion but are discussed elsewhere.

The most severe immediate reaction is anaphylaxis. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12855090\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of immediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate drug reactions result from the sudden, massive activation of mast cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basophils. These reactions can be further subdivided into IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions, depending upon the trigger for mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/basophil</span> activation. The desensitization techniques discussed here are applicable to both types of immediate reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">IgE-mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An IgE-mediated immediate reaction is triggered by binding of the administered drug to drug-specific IgE. Once formed, drug-specific IgE occupies surface receptors on mast cells and basophils throughout the body. If the drug is encountered again, it can bind to these IgE molecules, causing cross-linking of the receptors and activation of the cells, resulting in symptoms.</p><p>Drugs that are well known to cause IgE-mediated allergic reactions include penicillins, cephalosporins, and platinum-based chemotherapy agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A number of other drugs have been implicated in causing IgE-mediated reactions, albeit less commonly than the three groups mentioned previously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-reactions-to-systemic-chemotherapy#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion reactions to systemic chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Platinum drugs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-IgE-mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-IgE-mediated immediate reactions can be as severe as IgE-mediated reactions and may arise by several mechanisms not involving drug-specific IgE. These reactions are well described with taxane chemotherapy agents and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They can be clinically identical to IgE-mediated reactions, although some reactions include other features, such as sudden severe back pain (seen with the taxanes). Desensitization procedures designed for IgE-mediated reactions have been applied to immediate-type non-IgE-mediated reactions as well, with apparently similar outcomes, although the mechanisms involved are not known. Mast cell receptors, such as the MRGPRX2 (<strong>M</strong>as-<strong>r</strong>elated <strong>G p</strong>rotein-coupled <strong>r</strong>eceptor family member <strong>X2</strong>), can be activated by quinolones and paralyzing agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a>, and induce the release of mast cell mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Reduced skin sensitivity is observed following desensitization in most patients with IgE-mediated reactions, and some become skin test-negative at the end of the protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which temporary tolerance is induced during drug desensitization is not fully explained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/6,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,10</a>]. Possible mechanisms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alteration in expression of surface receptors</strong> &ndash; In vitro studies have demonstrated that subthreshold doses of antigen (in this case, the allergenic drug or some form of it) given prior to activating doses can render mast cells and basophils unresponsive to activation by that specific antigen but still responsive to other activating stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Subthreshold doses of antigen might result in monomeric binding to the IgE receptor (Fc-epsilon-R1), leading to internalization of the antigen-receptor complex (instead of the cross-linking that occurs when there is more antigen present), such that the cell does not become activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Alternatively, other research suggested that low doses of antigen might induce rearrangement of the cell membrane in antigen-sensitized mast cells, preventing the internalization of the <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/IgE/Fc-epsilon-R1</span> complex and protecting against anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) blocking antibodies</strong> &ndash; Both IgG and IgE antibodies specific to the antigen increase after desensitization therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The rising IgG titer may neutralize drug epitopes and serve a &quot;blocking&quot; function for IgE-dependent reactions, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated in maintaining drug desensitization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered cellular signaling in mast cells and basophils</strong> &ndash; Rapid in vitro desensitization of human mast cells and basophils results in a reduction in levels of certain signaling molecules, such as syk kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In keeping with the concept that changes in syk are important in both normal activation and in desensitization, naturally occurring syk-deficient basophils are unresponsive to drug antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The functions of syk in mast cell signaling are reviewed in more detail separately.

Blocking calcium flux and polymerization of actin filaments also appears to be critical to desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>Maintaining the desensitized state is dependent upon continuous exposure to the drug. Basophils can be desensitized in vitro to penicillin, but if isolated from a patient who was just desensitized and challenged in vitro with penicillin, the basophils will activate, demonstrating that the drug must be physically present to maintain the desensitized state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Desensitization is indicated in patients who are either proven (by positive skin testing or in vitro tests for drug-specific IgE), had elevated tryptase during the initial reaction (indicating mast cell activation), or are strongly suspected to have an immediate-type drug allergy based on clinical history <strong>and</strong> for whom there are no acceptable alternate drugs. If allergy evaluation or skin testing is not possible, the history of a reaction with the signs and symptoms described above qualifies the patient for desensitization. Testing procedures for drug allergies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An approach to the patient with drug allergy&quot;, section on 'Objective testing'</a>.)</p><p>Note that graded drug challenge is not safe in patients whose history strongly suggests that they have immediate, IgE-mediated allergy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>), because even the small initial amounts of drug given in graded challenges may induce severe reactions. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Immediate drug reactions'</a> above.)</p><p>Drug desensitization can be performed in patients of any age. Desensitizations have been safely performed in pregnant women when alternative therapies were not possible (eg, in order to administer penicillin to a penicillin-allergic woman with syphilis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21733079\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization is virtually <strong>never</strong> attempted in patients with histories of reactions involving significant skin desquamation, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, because even small doses of the drug may induce irreversible and potentially fatal recurrent desquamative reactions. Erythema multiforme and diffuse erythroderma with desquamation are other types of reactions for which desensitization should not be attempted. Desensitization is also not indicated for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/drug-induced</span> hypersensitivity syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(DRESS/DiHS),</span> acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), serum sickness reactions, nephritis, hepatitis, and other severe non-IgE-mediated reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11253450\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most situations, drug desensitizations should only be performed by allergy specialists trained in the technique and should not be done by other specialists not familiar with anaphylaxis and its treatment, since the risk for anaphylaxis remains elevated during desensitization under nonexpert guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk during a desensitization procedure is that of a recurrent immediate reaction. The risk of this in any individual patient depends upon the drug in question and the sensitivity of the patient. Most breakthrough reactions are mild and less severe than the patient's initial hypersensitivity reaction. However, clinical judgement and experience is invaluable in determining how to adjust a desensitization procedure if the patient does have breakthrough symptoms and in knowing when to abort a procedure. We know of no published fatalities resulting from failed desensitization procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11252787\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is the approach of one of the authors (MC) to stratify past reactions into three risk categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 1 reactions</strong> &ndash; Skin only</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 2 reactions</strong> &ndash; Two organ systems involved (eg, skin and respiratory tract)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 3 reactions</strong> &ndash; Includes changes in vital signs with one or more organ systems involved</p><p/><p>A standardized protocol (of 12 steps) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F52381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52381 \">table 3</a>) has been successful in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to a variety of drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, we recommend that patients with grade 3 reactions be desensitized using a more gradual protocol (the 16-step protocol) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65192 \">table 4</a>) as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

For patients with cardiac disease, restrictive or obstructive pulmonary diseases, and those in whom beta-blocker therapy cannot be easily discontinued for the procedure, we also suggest that desensitization be performed in an intensive care setting.</p><p>If a patient with a past grade 3 reaction requires recurrent infusions of the drug in question and has successfully undergone uncomplicated desensitization in the hospital, we sometimes carry out repeat desensitizations for that patient in a carefully monitored outpatient setting, such as an infusion center, staffed with a clinician and nurses who have been trained in desensitization.</p><p>Allergists should be available within several minutes of the location where the desensitization is being performed. One-to-one nursing is provided with a nurse who has been specifically trained to monitor desensitization protocols and recognize and treat allergic reactions during the first desensitization, and one-to-two nursing for subsequent desensitizations. This nurse has been trained and preauthorized to administer any medications that may be required to treat an allergic reaction, including intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> for anaphylaxis, so that there will be no delay in treatment if the supervising clinician is not at the bedside when the symptoms begin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11253403\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications include breakthrough allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, and rare immunologic sequelae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence of breakthrough symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During desensitizations to chemotherapy agents and antibiotics, breakthrough allergic reactions occur up to 20 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/22,25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,27,28</a>]. Although most reactions are mild in severity, patients with initial grade 3 reactions are at risk for anaphylaxis during desensitization.

Once the medication is discontinued, the patient's hypersensitivity to the medication returns.</p><p>Desensitization is usually performed by starting with a <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000<sup>th</sup></span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100<sup>th</sup></span> <strong>dilution</strong> of the drug, which is used to administer an initial <strong>dose </strong>that is <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10,000<sup>th</sup></span> of the full dose (note the distinction between dilution and dose), typically over 15 minutes. In exquisitely sensitive patients, an even lower dilution that did <strong>not</strong> produce a positive reaction during skin testing can be used as a starting dilution instead (for patients who had positive results to lower concentrations on skin testing). Progressively greater doses of a drug are then administered in a stepwise manner until a full therapeutic dose has been delivered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12855313\"><span class=\"h2\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization can be performed by oral, intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/7,25,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25,32-34</a>]. The IV route is the most often used for IV medications, since it provides control of the rate and amount of drug infusion, which can be stopped at any time during the delivery of drug, in contrast to oral administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>].

Step 1 consists of solution 1, administered at a rate of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> for 15 minutes.

Solution 1 is then replaced by solution 2, which is given in the same manner, followed by solution 3. The final step, step 12, is longer in duration and delivers the remainder of the solution required to reach a full therapeutic dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of symptoms during desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the success of desensitization depends upon the comfort and experience of the supervising allergy specialist in managing breakthrough reactions. Nearly all symptoms can be effectively managed and the protocol ultimately completed. Breakthrough symptoms most typically occur between steps 8 and 12.</p><p>If symptoms arise during the procedure, the infusion should be halted temporarily until symptoms have resolved. Sometimes, symptoms will resolve with stopping the infusion alone but if symptoms are significant, do not appear to be resolving spontaneously, or are worsening, then treatment should be administered. Treatment usually consists of antihistamines for pruritus or urticaria, inhaled bronchodilators for chest tightness or wheezing, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> for uncommon systemic reactions, hypotension, or laryngeal edema. Glucocorticoids are not usually given in this setting, because they are of little benefit in treating acute reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1284691323\"><span class=\"h4\">Adjusting the protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once breakthrough symptoms have been treated and have resolved, the protocol is resumed by repeating the step at which the reaction occurred. We do not back up and repeat earlier steps. Not repeating earlier steps is important with drugs for which the target dose is precise, such as chemotherapy agents. With other drugs (eg, antibiotics), the final dose may not need to be as precise.</p><p>If the patient reacts again to the same step with severe symptoms (which is unusual), we usually abort the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'When to abort a desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p>We have noticed that breakthrough reactions are more common at certain points in the protocol. During desensitizations to chemotherapy agents and antibiotics, breakthrough symptoms occur most often at step 12, whereas with biologic agents, patients may react at different steps (steps 9 to 12) during infusion of the most concentrated solution.</p><p>If the patient experienced a breakthrough reaction and needs repeat desensitization in the future (as is often the case in patients requiring chemotherapy) or if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> reacted with hypotension or laryngeal edema that responded rapidly and completely to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, we then modify the protocol to add an intermediate step before the one at which symptoms occurred. As an example, if a patient reacted during the first few minutes of step 12, we would then add an extra step before that one, and this modified protocol is used for all of the patient's future desensitizations. Usually, we increase the infusion rate less than twofold to create an extra step.</p><p>If the patient experienced breakthrough symptoms in the early steps of the protocol, a 16-step protocol could be used in the future for that patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65192 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>If a patient experienced no symptoms during the final step of the initial desensitization, then the rate of infusion during the final step may be accelerated for repeat desensitizations. The maximum rate of infusion should be that rate at which the drug is normally given. This modification can be helpful by reducing the time required to perform the desensitization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">When to abort a desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A desensitization should be aborted if a patient develops hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngeal edema that is not immediately responsive to intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If hypotension or laryngeal edema did resolve with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and the medication is critical for the patient's treatment, then we continue the protocol, although the supervising clinician must use clinical judgement in this situation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, if a step is repeated because symptoms developed and the patient reacts again to this step with severe symptoms, we usually abort the procedure. Recurrence of symptoms when a step is repeated is unusual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another reason to abort a desensitization is an acute hematologic reaction, such as bleeding due to rapidly developing thrombocytopenia (reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> and some monoclonal antibodies).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall success rate of desensitization depends upon the protocol used, the sensitivity of the patient, and the mix of IgE-mediated and other immediate reactions. Another important factor is the expertise of the supervising clinician in managing any symptoms that occur and adjusting the procedure accordingly.</p><p>IgE-mediated reactions, such as those to beta-lactam antibiotics and platinum-based chemotherapy agents, have very high rates of success. In experienced hands, virtually all of these desensitizations are successful.</p><p>In most cases, patients who experience breakthrough reactions during initial desensitizations display fewer symptoms upon repeat desensitization, using the approach described above for modifying the protocol. However, there may be an important subset of patients in which this is not the case. In a study of desensitizations to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, a small number of patients undergoing desensitization more than eight times appeared to have a resurgence in their sensitivity to the drug during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We have also noticed this in a small number of patients requiring repeated desensitizations to one chemotherapy agent or antibiotic. This phenomenon requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5257165\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintaining the desensitized state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desensitization induces a <strong>temporary</strong> state of clinical tolerance. After a patient has been desensitized, the drug is given normally at the usual intervals, provided that doses are at least daily. If the drug is stopped, allergic sensitivity will return shortly after the medication is cleared from the bloodstream.</p><p>Maintaining the desensitized state is dependent upon the continuous presence of the drug in the patient's system. Accordingly, it is important to give doses regularly and on time so that there is no interruption in exposure. For hospitalized patients, the pharmacy and nursing staff should be informed about the importance of giving subsequent doses on time.</p><p>Once the drug is discontinued or doses are missed, the desensitized state dissipates over days to weeks. The speed with which the patient's sensitivity to the medicine returns if the drug is not given is dependent upon multiple variables. These include the half-life of the drug, the formation of drug-containing immune complexes that can delay clearance of the drug, the degree to which the drug binds to serum proteins or other tissues, and the patient's renal function. In most instances, the patient will remain desensitized for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours so that missing a single dose does not usually necessitate repeat desensitization. Return of the patient's sensitivity is difficult to predict, and repeat desensitization is usually performed if more than 48 hours have elapsed since the last dose.</p><p>In the case of drugs that are dosed intermittently based on serum levels, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or the aminoglycosides, levels should be monitored daily to ensure that exposure is ongoing and doses can be given when appropriate for that patient. Although this approach has not been formally studied, it is logical that the patient should remain desensitized as long as the drug is detectable in the serum.</p><p>In the case of chemotherapy, most agents are given weekly to every three to four weeks, and the period between doses is too long to maintain desensitization. Thus, for most chemotherapies, desensitization has to be repeated for each dose.</p><p>Desensitization is also dose-dependent, meaning that once a patient has been desensitized to a specific dose, a substantial dose increase may result in breakthrough allergic symptoms. Desensitization may also be concentration-dependent in some patients, and it is prudent to design the desensitization so that the final (most concentrated) solution is the same concentration at which the drug is normally delivered (for intravenous medications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A few reports have described the long-term maintenance of desensitization by chronic daily oral administration for select patients in whom recurrent infections necessitated intermittent antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/7,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,43</a>] or for whom occupational exposure was unavoidable and disabling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, published clinical experience with chronic drug desensitization is very limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362703760\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING THE PATIENT AFTER DESENSITIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient must be counseled that desensitization is <strong>not a permanent cure</strong> for allergy to the drug in question. The sensitivity returns once the drug is cleared from the bloodstream, and the patient should continue to report an allergy to that agent in the future. If the drug is needed again in the year or two after the desensitization, the procedure should be repeated. If years have elapsed since a patient was desensitized to a drug, the patient's allergic status should be re-evaluated if the drug is needed again. For penicillin, many patients lose IgE-mediated allergy over years, so repeat skin testing can help guide whether desensitization needs to be repeated or if the patient has lost the allergy in the interim.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3010547991\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Immediate drug reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization is <strong>not</strong> effective and may be dangerous (even fatal) in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/drug-induced</span> hypersensitivity syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(DRESS/DiHS),</span> acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), diffuse erythroderma with desquamation, and serum sickness reactions. (See <a href=\"#H21733079\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premedications are administered before some but not all desensitizations, depending on the mechanism that is believed to underlie the reaction. In addition, any premedications that are normally given before administration in a patient without hypersensitivity should also be given before desensitization. (See <a href=\"#H11253201\" class=\"local\">'Premedications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The success rate of drug desensitization is very high when performed by experienced drug allergy experts. Patients may experience mild breakthrough reactions during as many as 20 percent of desensitizations, and the clinician's experience in managing these is critical. Breakthrough symptoms are managed by stopping the infusion temporarily, administering specific treatments, and restarting the protocol again at the step that elicited symptoms. The protocol should be adjusted to advance through the problematic step more gradually if it is to be performed again in the same patient. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Technical aspects of desensitization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient must be counseled that desensitization is <strong>not a permanent cure</strong> for allergy to the drug in question. The sensitivity returns once the drug is cleared from the bloodstream, and the patient should continue to report an allergy to that agent in the future. (See <a href=\"#H362703760\" class=\"local\">'Counseling the patient after desensitization'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Johansson SG, Bieber T, Dahl R, et al.
