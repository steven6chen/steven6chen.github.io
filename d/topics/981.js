It usually begins in the teenage or early adult years.</p><p>People with anorexia nervosa often hide how thin they are or deny that they have a problem. They often don't want treatment, because they don't want to gain weight. But it's important for people to get treatment, because people can get seriously ill and die from anorexia nervosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12782706\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for anorexia nervosa?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by talking with you, measuring your height and weight, and doing an exam.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will do tests to check your health, because anorexia nervosa can lead to many health problems. You will probably have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ECG &ndash; An ECG measures the electrical activity in your heart and records your heart rate and rhythm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12782721\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can anorexia nervosa cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorexia nervosa can cause many problems. That's because the body and brain don't get the nutrition they need. Anorexia nervosa can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and glands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone loss and muscle weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating and trouble having bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinning hair and nails that break easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling cold all the time or tired a lot</p><p/><p>People with anorexia nervosa can also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression &ndash; This is when people feel very sad, empty, or hopeless most of the time, or do not enjoy the things that usually make them happy. In addition, people can have trouble with their sleep, appetite, energy, memory, or concentration. Some depressed people think about hurting themselves. <strong>If you are thinking of hurting yourself, call your doctor or nurse right away</strong> or go to the hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety &ndash; This is when people worry a lot or think about certain things over and over.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol or drug abuse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with memory, thinking, or paying attention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12782736\"><span class=\"h1\">How is anorexia nervosa treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for anorexia nervosa involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gaining weight &ndash; You will work with your doctor and a dietitian (food expert) to gain weight. The dietitian will make meal plans that can help you gain weight safely and slowly. The doctor will follow your weight and health closely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy &ndash; Psychotherapy involves meeting with a therapist to talk about your feelings, thoughts, and life. Different kinds of psychotherapy can be helpful, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Working one-on-one with a therapist</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Family therapy &ndash; Your family can work with a therapist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Group therapy &ndash; You can join a group for people with eating disorders.</p><p/><p>Medicines are not usually used to treat anorexia nervosa, except in certain cases when the above treatments alone don't help.</p><p>Some people can be treated at home, but others need to be treated in the hospital. It depends on the person's weight, symptoms, and health problems. Treatment for anorexia nervosa can be hard work, and it can take a long time. A complete recovery can take years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12782751\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people get better with treatment. But people with anorexia nervosa often &quot;relapse.&quot; This is when their symptoms return and they lose weight again.</p><p>To help prevent a relapse, you can follow your treatment plan and keep seeing your therapist. If you start to have symptoms again, let your family or doctor know as soon as possible so that you can get help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12782766\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bulimia-nervosa-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bulimia nervosa (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Generalized anxiety disorder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
