Prominent hallucinations and other psychotic or marked mood symptoms are absent. Nonprominent hallucinations and odd behaviors related to the delusional theme may be present. </p><p>Delusional disorder is not well studied relative to other psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. Much of the information in the sections on epidemiology, course, and treatment is drawn from small samples or based on clinical experience. Longitudinal and population-based studies are needed to better characterize the disorder, and clinical trials are needed to identify effective treatments. </p><p>This topic discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, and treatment of delusional disorder. Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychoses are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, and treatment of delusional parasitosis, a delusional disorder of the somatic type, are described separately.

The epidemiology of delusional disorders has not been studied in large, community-based samples. These findings and the DSM-5&rsquo;s estimated lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder (0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] are far lower than the estimated lifetime prevalence for other major psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia (0.3 to 0.87 percent) and bipolar I disorder (0.24 to 0.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Rates of delusional disorder reported in samples of patients receiving mental health treatment have ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. </p><p>Attempts to quantify incidence estimates (0.7 to 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">0/100,000)</span> have been based on hospital admission data of uncertain accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Because a significant proportion of people with delusional disorder do not regard it as an illness or receive treatment, and measurement often relies, to some extent, on self-report, studies likely underestimate the prevalence of the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720411\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for delusional disorder include a family history of paranoid personality disorder and sensory impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/3,4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8</a>]. Studies have identified numerous sociodemographic and clinical factors that may be risk factors for delusional disorder, but require further research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/3,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720561\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbid conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small studies of patients with delusional disorder have found psychiatric comorbidity rates of 35 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Depression has been the most commonly observed co-occurring condition, but anxiety can also be a significant factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, in a study of 46 patients with a delusional disorder, 33 were found to have at least one other lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, most frequently a mood disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with the persecutory subtype were most likely to have a mood disorder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720230\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distribution of subtypes has been found to be similar in reports of several cohorts, with persecutory and jealous subtypes among the most common, and erotomanic and grandiose among the least [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/3,4,13,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,13,17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H458406417\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> below.)</p><p>As an example, a case registry study in Spain described 467 patients with delusional disorder, 56.5 percent female and a mean age of 55 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The distribution of subtypes in the sample was as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persecutory, 48 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jealous, 11 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed, 11 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic, 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not otherwise specified, 23 percent</p><p/><p>Hallucinations were present in 16 percent of patients. Nine percent had a family history of schizophrenia. Forty-two percent had a co-occurring diagnosis of a personality disorder (mostly paranoid personality disorder). Depression was significantly more common among patients with persecutory and jealous subtypes. The mean Global Assessment of Functioning score was 51, suggesting low functionality among these individuals. Better functioning (reflected in higher scores on this rating scale in this sample) was seen among jealous and mixed cases compared with erotomanic and grandiose cases. </p><p>Features of delusional disorder subtypes are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H458406417\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1909883795\"><span class=\"h2\">First episode cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comparison of demographic, clinical, and cognitive differences among 71 patients with first episode delusional disorder and 71 age-matched patients with first episode schizophrenia found that patients with delusional disorder had less evidence of premorbid schizoid and schizotypal traits, and were more likely to be married [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. No differences between the two groups were detected in duration of untreated psychosis, pathways to care, symptom severity, neurocognitive performance, treatment, and functioning. These findings, though limited to first-episode cases, challenge previous views that delusional disorder cases exhibit better functioning than cases with schizophrenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28688688\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of delusional disorder is not known. Lines of investigation have sought insight through study of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors such as individuals with sensory impairment, especially hearing or vision; isolated immigrant or linguistic group individuals; individuals with family history of suspiciousness, marked jealousy (see <a href=\"#H720411\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delusions are common in many apparently distinct idiopathic psychopathological conditions, medical diseases, intoxications, and other conditions that can manifest delusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/4,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20-22</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that appear to promote delusional thinking, such as reasoning biases, perception of threat, fatigue, and emotional distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]</p><p/><p>Other evidence points to a genetic predisposition to a selective D2 receptor-related hyperdopaminergia, and to dopamine neurotransmitter dysfunction investigations suggesting that delusional disorder may be a more purely D2-related psychotic condition than more common psychoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Another hypothesis proposes decreased striatal dopamine transporter functioning as a cause of primary and secondary cases of delusional parasitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28688694\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of delusional disorder can be organized conceptually around a delusional concern or theme. Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme. Behavior unrelated to the delusion often is normal; functioning may be impaired, particularly if the delusional thinking is pervasive and chronic rather than episodic. Patients can appear to be functioning normally when not focusing on or being preoccupied by the delusional thinking. (See <a href=\"#H458406417\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> below.)</p><p>When they are preoccupied with delusional concerns, their emotional responses and actions are in accordance with their beliefs, as they seek solutions or information about their plight from varied sources, including dermatologists, lawyers, primary care physicians, medical specialists, surgeons, the police, private detectives, or the courts to find relief for their distress. They steadfastly refuse to characterize their beliefs as false and view opposing views with surprise, if not hostility and disdain, dismissing or ignoring them, and continuing their struggle to find resolution or restitution for the wrongs they have endured or the illnesses from which they suffer. </p><p>They generally have no insight into their illness. They typically reject and often resent the suggestion that they are mentally compromised. They are a difficult group to engage clinically, often refusing to meet with a clinician about their delusions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to take medication. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with a false belief that he is being persecuted, conspired against, or potentially harmed. His actions are generally consistent with the delusional concerns, eg, taking a circuitous path to a destination to keep from being followed; taking surreptitious&nbsp;looks over the shoulder. The actions are well planned and executed, and carried out with emotional fervor and determined effort to protect against the actions of the suspected source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An individual with somatic delusions may not be particularly suspicious, and may even be warm and emotionally less constricted. She may complain about her pains, somatic sensations, disappointments and about the frustration of not being treated or believed. She may focus on her appearance and its impact on her sense of well-being. </p><p/><p>There may or may not be other, overt indications of psychopathology. Some minor emotional and behavioral features may be observable. Having a belief that others do not possess and actively oppose is understandably likely to generate guardedness, perhaps evasiveness in speaking with clinicians. Speech, motor tension, eye contact, and emotional reactions may be affected by the delusional thoughts.</p><p>In many cases there is not prominent suspicion, rather there may primarily be worry as in the somatic delusional individual described above. The patient&rsquo;s thinking and organization of behavior unrelated to the delusional concern is typically normal. Alternatively, careful examination may detect other characteristics of paranoid behavior, including suspiciousness, arrogance, complaining, belligerence, anger, hostility and even violence. </p><p>In some cases, the patient may report dysphoric experiences, such as depressed mood or anxiety, heightened tension, or somatic sensations. </p><p>The traditional perspective of cognitive functioning in patients with delusional disorder is that the clinical mental status exam shows alertness, orientation, memory, and attention to be within normal limits (while insight and judgment related to the delusion were typically impaired). More recent research has suggested that subtle compromise in cognitive function may be present, particularly among those without a comorbid psychiatric disorder. This cognitive impairment has been described as possibly similar to that seen in more common psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychological assessment found working memory dysfunction in nine patients with delusional disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A factor analytic symptom study reported an association between cognitive dysfunction and poorer global functioning in 86 outpatients with delusional disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same group reported clear impairments in executive functioning and memory in 86 patients with delusional disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 21 patients with delusional disorder reported social cognition deficits and changes in personality, albeit at levels less than those observed in schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>Rates of suicidal ideation and behavior in patients with delusional disorder, based on several small studies, may be greater than in patients without psychiatric disorders and comparable to rates seen in patients with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Individuals afflicted with persecutory and somatic delusions have been reported to be more likely than other subtypes to report suicidality. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28688700\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age of onset of delusional disorder most often has been reported to occur in the 35 to 45 years range, but outliers have been reported between ages 18 to 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. The onset of delusional disorder can be acute, even sudden, or less commonly the disorder develops gradually. An acute onset has been associated with the presence of a precipitating event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Delusions are often the initial manifestation of the disorder, but premorbid traits, including odd behavior and personality changes, have been reported in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A commonly held view is that the course of the disorder is relatively persistent and stable; in fact, limited study suggests a more varied course. A study of 301 cases reported remission in about one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In approximately two-thirds of cases, the course of the disorder is life-long, with delusions present continuously in some cases and periodically in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. The diagnostic stability of delusional disorder is less than that of some psychotic disorders; the most frequent change in diagnosis is to schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Delusional disorder is often a disabling illness. The condition often disrupts progress toward personal and occupational goals; patients with the disorder typically achieve less in their lives than their innate abilities would suggest. In our clinical experience, the course can be influenced by personal circumstances (eg, education, socioeconomic status, and physical health), the availability of personal support, and willingness to maintain treatment. Delusional disorder can be a source of profound individual and familial suffering. In cases of delusional jealousy and erotomania, the suffering can extend to other victims as well. Available data suggest that patients with delusional disorders have a better global outcome than patients with schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The avoidance of treatment by patients with delusional disorder is reflected in data showing lower rates of psychiatric outpatient treatment compared with patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/3,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35</a>]. Lower hospitalization rates, rather than suggesting better clinical outcomes for patients with delusional disorder, may reflect a more isolated and subtler deterioration in functioning. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458403183\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A key part of the evaluation of delusional disorder is to assess the reality of delusional concerns. This can be challenging because patients with delusional disorder may appear functionally intact and describe beliefs with plausible content. Questions along these lines should be undertaken with diplomacy and sensitivity to the patient&rsquo;s reaction. Such exploration in the realm of the delusion may raise the possibility that the thinking is not delusional, and may suggest alternative sources of the patient&rsquo;s suffering.</p><p>A detailed patient history, collateral history from key informants, and consideration of medical, substance-related, and other causes of delusions by physical and laboratory examinations are needed to work through the differential diagnosis of delusional disorder and potential co-occurring conditions. A thorough diagnostic evaluation and differential diagnosis of patients with psychosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H720561\" class=\"local\">'Comorbid conditions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28688780\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults#H261969428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>A comprehensive and systematic mental status examination should be performed, including a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the putative delusional thinking. Detection of some of the subtle cognitive impairments described earlier may require standardized assessments of memory, attention, intelligence, and executive functioning. (See <a href=\"#H28688694\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Suicidal and violent thinking as well as impulsivity should be carefully assessed and inquiries directed toward past history to determine risk and how these experiences were dealt with. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28688712\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of delusional disorder requires fulfillment of the DSM-5 criteria, below. Medical history (including substance use), physical examination, and laboratory testing are used to rule out medical causes of psychosis. No laboratory test can make the diagnosis of delusional disorder, but a detailed psychiatric history and exam can be used to distinguish delusional disorder from other mental disorders. The differential diagnosis is provided below. The differential diagnosis of psychosis is described in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults#H261969398\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for delusional disorder are as follows: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of one month or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Note: Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (eg, the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406417\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The subtypes of delusional disorder are categorized by central themes of the delusions observed in patients meeting criteria for delusional disorder. Many case reports and papers characterize their distinctness as well as their connection to this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Each subtype can be primary (an idiopathic disorder that meets diagnostic criteria) or secondary (arising from specific causes, such as general medical illness). The delusional themes and common consequences are described below. In each case, the central belief should be thoroughly reviewed and found to be false. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406452\"><span class=\"h3\">Erotomanic type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient believes that another person is secretly in love with her or him. That person may be famous or have some kind of higher status, usually not part of the patient&rsquo;s social circle, and not likely to be attainable. Affected individuals may attempt to communicate with the object of their affection and attempt to meet <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> in person. Such effort can lead to stalking in some cases, with some risk for assaultive behavior. Expressions of love may be intense, and rejections by the loved person interpreted oddly as affirmations of love to deflect suspicions or jealousy from the loved person&rsquo;s spouse. Other names: DeClerambault syndrome, erotomania, psychose passionelle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406458\"><span class=\"h3\">Grandiose type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient believes <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has special prominence or talent, unusual fame, or major achievements. Features of the patient&rsquo;s thinking may suggest the grandiosity associated with mania, but in the delusional disorder, the mood disturbance and behaviors characteristic of mania are not present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406464\"><span class=\"h3\">Jealous type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The delusional theme is the patient believes that a spouse or lover is unfaithful and finds &quot;evidence&quot; to support the delusion, accuses him or her, and relentlessly tries to substantiate the offense. The delusion of jealousy can lead to aggressive, threatening, and possibly violent behavior, including homicide and suicide. In some cases delusional jealousy and its disruptive impact may only improve through separation from the suspected unfaithful partner. Other names: pathological or morbid jealousy, Othello syndrome, conjugal paranoia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406470\"><span class=\"h3\">Persecutory type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is typically preoccupied by a delusion that he or she is being persecuted, conspired against, or potentially harmed. <span class=\"nowrap\">His/her</span> resulting actions are generally consistent with these concerns; they are well planned and executed, and carried out with emotional fervor and determined effort. These individuals may resort to the courts and even to violence to right the wrongs directed at them. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406476\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatic type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient believes that something awful is wrong with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> body. There are several forms: that one is ill with undiagnosed disease; that one is infested with parasites or insects (delusional parasitosis); or that parts of the body are misshapen, ugly, or emanate a foul odor. Individuals generally go from one doctor to another, specialist to specialist, usually disappointed by the failure to detect and diagnose the medical problem that haunts them. Suicide may be a risk, thought due to frustration and lack of effective clinical intervention. Other names: hypochondriacal delusion, monosymptomatic hypochondriasis. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of delusional parasitosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis#H2369942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delusional infestation: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-delusional-infestation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of delusional infestation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406504\"><span class=\"h3\">Mixed type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No one delusional theme predominates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458406510\"><span class=\"h3\">Unspecified type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dominant delusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described by the subtypes above.</p><p>Other notable differences between the DSM-IV and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are a clearer demarcation of delusional disorder in DSM-5 from psychotic variants of obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder that is made explicit with a new exclusion criterion.

Hence a practical principle is to detect or rule out other possible, usually more common causes, before arriving at the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/4,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52785 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96392 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance-induced disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96392 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other mental disorders, including schizophrenia and mood disorder</p><p/><p>The clinical evaluation to rule out other causes of psychosis is described above. (See <a href=\"#H458403183\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>Distinguishing features of delusional disorder include the absence of medical illnesses and medications causing psychosis, presence of delusions for at least one month, the absence of other positive symptoms of psychosis (except for hallucinations that are part of the delusional theme), the absence of functional impairment (except that related to the delusional theme), and the absence of overlap (or overlap of a limited duration) between mood symptoms and the delusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Schizophrenia typically presents with a broader array of positive and negative symptoms and marked functional impairment for at least six months. In bipolar disorder and major depression with psychotic features, delusional thinking is typically accompanied by mania or depression. An algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F100456\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100456 \">algorithm 1</a>) depicts the differential diagnosis of delusional disorder.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of psychosis is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults#H261969428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458404101\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest first-line treatment of delusional disorder with antipsychotic medication rather than other clinical interventions. Because patients with the disorder often reject psychiatric treatment, it is particularly important that medication be prescribed in the context of a therapeutic relationship that includes support, education, encouragement of healthier pursuits, and discouragement of damaging, delusion-inspired actions. Patients may be engageable around the possibility of relief from unpleasant preoccupations and isolation associated with the consuming mission of responding to delusional concerns. </p><p>For patients who will not take or cannot tolerate antipsychotic medicine (despite use of the pharmacotherapeutic strategies described below), we suggest treatment of delusional disorder with cognitive behavioral therapy rather than other treatments.</p><p>Identification of co-occurring psychiatric disorders may help the clinician engage a patient with delusional disorder. The patient is more likely to be willing to discuss and receive treatment for a co-occurring anxiety or depression, rather than for the delusion(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. If the comorbidity can be effectively dealt with, the patient may then be more inclined to participate in treatment for the delusion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28688786\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical trials comparing antipsychotic medication with placebo in delusional disorders. Published case <span class=\"nowrap\">reports/series,</span> open trials, and our clinical experience suggest that antipsychotic medications can be effective for delusional disorder.</p><p>Treatment of patients with delusional disorder with antipsychotic medication requires careful effort because of the patient&rsquo;s denial of illness and frequent suspicion of clinician motives for pharmacological intervention. The clinician needs to allay concerns and foster a working alliance with the patient. It is particularly important to provide the patient with information about how the medication would be useful, for what target symptoms, with what possible side effects, and the likely length of treatment. </p><p>Even begrudging or halfhearted agreement by the patient to take the medication is an important first step. Patients may need to experience improvement on a medication before expressing some acceptance of the treatment. Side effects are very likely to evoke refusal to continue medication.</p><p>An antipsychotic agent with as few side effects as possible (consider <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>) should be used. Start the medication at a low dose and increase gradually over a several days or weeks to assure tolerability. Once a therapeutic dose is achieved, examine for evidence of response at two weeks before increasing the dose further or changing the medication. &#160;</p><p>As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> can be started at 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and increased slowly to 10 mg before looking for clinical response to occur. Once a response is detected, observe for a week or more before further dose adjustments. The pharmacology and side effects of antipsychotic medications are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the patient refuses the antipsychotic medication, or if it is ineffective or poorly tolerated, actions to further enhance the alliance may be helpful. Identifying the symptomatic source of the patient&rsquo;s distress (eg, anxiety, depression, anger, or perhaps physical discomfort) may provide a critical clue to what will help relieve the patient, particularly when antipsychotic agents are not tolerated (or possibly refused). Making inroads by giving relief to symptoms other than delusions may lead to acceptance of antipsychotic medication. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720843\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized clinical trials of antipsychotic medications in patients with delusional disorder. Retrospective studies of treated cases have reported substantial, but widely varying, response and remission rates. Reductions in delusional symptoms were reported with both first- and second-generation antipsychotic medications. No advantages in efficacy were found for one antipsychotic medication over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clozapine</a> has not been rigorously tested for delusional disorder. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pimozide</a> has been used to treat delusional disorder in many published cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]; however, there are no convincing data to suggest its efficacy exceeds that of other antipsychotics.

For patients who deny that their concerns are delusional, a supportive approach to psychotherapy, with a listening and verbally supportive strategy intended to ease distress, may be helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-and-maintaining-a-therapeutic-relationship-in-psychiatric-practice\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship in psychiatric practice&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There have been no clinical trials of specific psychosocial interventions for delusional disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), core family therapy, and supportive therapy have been suggested for the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154999014\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT has been adapted to treat psychotic disorders, principally schizophrenia. The approach aims to identify and address patient features believed to be associated with delusions, such as data gathering biases, interpersonal sensitivity, reasoning style, worry, and insomnia, factors thought to influence how a delusional patient interprets evidence pertinent to delusions or how he or she considers alternative (nonpsychotic) explanations for the phenomena. Discussion and critique of the patient&rsquo;s explanations for delusional ideas are practical techniques aimed at breaking down the certitude and emotional underpinnings that maintain the idea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia#H633970811\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia&quot;, section on 'Cognitive behavioral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of CBT in delusional disorder has not been adequately tested in multiple, robust clinical trials. A number of case reports and a randomized clinical trial in 24 patients comparing CBT with an attention placebo control have shown positive impact on the delusional thinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delusional-disorder/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154999001\"><span class=\"h3\">Supportive psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In supportive psychotherapy, the clinician attempts to gain insight into the often painful quality of these patients&rsquo; experiences with delusional disorder and connect with the patient in such areas with understanding and suggestions aimed at reducing discomfort. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154999053\"><span class=\"h2\">Involuntary treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involuntary treatment with antipsychotic medication may have a role in the treatment of a patient with delusional disorder at serious risk of harming oneself or others.

Prominent hallucinations and other psychotic or marked mood symptoms are absent. (See <a href=\"#H28688664\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28688712\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidemiology of delusional disorders has not been studied in sufficiently large, community-based samples to provide persuasive estimates of its incidence or prevalence. Its prevalence is believed to be far less than that of schizophrenia (0.3 to 0.9 percent) or bipolar I disorder (0.2 to 0.6 percent). (See <a href=\"#H28688670\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies of patients with delusional disorder have found psychiatric comorbidity rates of 35 to 72 percent. Depression has been the most commonly observed co-occurring condition, but anxiety can also be a significant factor. (See <a href=\"#H28688670\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with delusional disorder typically reject the characterization of their beliefs as false and continue seeking to find help with the objects of their delusions. They generally have no insight into their illness. They often refuse to see a mental health clinician and usually reject antipsychotic medication, making treatment challenging. (See <a href=\"#H28688694\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many patients, delusional disorder may be accompanied by depression, anxiety, suicidality, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subtle cognitive impairment. Neuropsychiatric testing may be helpful for monitoring change in cognitive impairment over time, eg, before and after treatment. (See <a href=\"#H28688694\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H458403183\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of delusional disorder can be acute, even sudden, or less commonly the disorder develops gradually. The course of the disorder varies among those afflicted, with perhaps one-third experiencing remission and two-thirds a prolonged course. In the latter group, delusions can be present continuously or periodically. Patients with delusional disorder can have significant functional impairment, achieving less than their peers without the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H28688700\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed patient history and collateral history from key informants are critical for making the diagnosis of delusional disorder. Consideration of medical and other causes of delusions by physical and laboratory examinations is essential. A comprehensive and systematic mental status examination should be performed, including a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the putative delusional thinking. (See <a href=\"#H458403183\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subtypes of delusional disorder include erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, somatic, mixed, and unspecified types. Delusional parasitosis, a somatic subtype, is discussed separately.
