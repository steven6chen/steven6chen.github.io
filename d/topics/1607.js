People can get infections from other people, animals, mosquitoes, and certain foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28792401\"><span class=\"h1\">Which infections can cause problems for a mother and her baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different kinds of infections can cause health problems for a mother and her baby. Some of the more serious are listed below, but others are important, too:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parvovirus, also called &quot;fifth disease&quot; &ndash; Parvovirus is spread from person to person. It can cause a rash on the face, chest, back, arms, and legs. It can also cause joint pain and body aches. If you have been around someone who has parvovirus, tell your doctor or nurse. He or she might do a blood test to check for the infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytomegalovirus, also called &quot;CMV&quot; &ndash; CMV can be spread by sex and through saliva, urine, and other body fluids. It can cause a fever, sore throat, or body aches. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have these symptoms. He or she might do a blood test to check for CMV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxoplasmosis &ndash; People can get toxoplasmosis from eating uncooked meat or by touching cat waste when cleaning a cat's litter box. Toxoplasmosis does not usually cause symptoms in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listeria &ndash; Listeria can cause a fever, chills, and back pain. People can get it from eating spoiled food. Sometimes, it can be hard to tell if food is spoiled. Because of this, most doctors recommend that pregnant women avoid certain foods, such as raw milk, soft cheeses, and deli meats. Ask your doctor or nurse which foods to avoid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zika virus &ndash; People can get Zika from a mosquito bite in some parts of the world. It's also possible to get Zika through unprotected sex with someone who has the virus. Most people with Zika have no symptoms, or only mild symptoms. Symptoms can include fever, rash, joint pain, and headache. If you are pregnant and were recently in one of the areas where there is Zika, tell your doctor or nurse. Also tell them if you have had unprotected sex with anyone who has (or might have) Zika.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28792408\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about vaccines and pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections. Some vaccines are safe to get during pregnancy. These include vaccines to prevent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza (flu) &ndash; The flu can cause a fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, or sore throat. All adults should get the flu vaccine each year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis &ndash; Tetanus causes the muscles to work abnormally. Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Pertussis, also known as &quot;whooping cough,&quot; causes a severe cough. All pregnant women should get the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine at 27 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, even if they got it before. Babies who get pertussis can get very sick.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28792415\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to avoid getting an infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chance of getting an infection in different ways. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often, especially after preparing food. Also, wash your hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, gardening, or touching garbage or animals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sharing foods, drinks, or eating utensils with other people</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pay attention to food safety and follow the food safety tips in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60529\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60529 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid getting mosquito bites by using bug spray, wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts, and staying inside at dusk</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a condom when you have sex, if there is a chance that your sex partner has an infection you could catch during sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid traveling to countries where you could catch serious infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid touching rats or mice</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid cleaning a cat's litter box &ndash; If you need to clean a cat's litter box, use gloves and wash your hands afterward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that your family members are up-to-date on their vaccines so they stay healthy, too</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28792422\"><span class=\"h1\">What&rsquo;s the best way to wash hands?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to wash hands is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wet your hands and put soap on them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rub your hands together for 15 to 30 seconds.
