In the United States and Europe, the risk of HIV transmission from mother to infant had declined to historically low levels with the use of antiretroviral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Contributions to this successful prevention effort include universal testing of pregnant women for HIV infection, the use of cesarean delivery (when appropriate), and avoidance of breastfeeding, when feasible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-woman-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal evaluation of the HIV-infected woman in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will address antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the HIV-infected pregnant woman, intrapartum management, and antiretroviral prophylaxis of her infant in resource-rich settings. In October 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States published updated guidelines on the evaluation and management of HIV-infected pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Our recommendations below are largely consistent with these guidelines. Many newer drug regimens recommended as preferred agents for nonpregnant adults have not yet been studied in pregnancy. Thus, recommended regimens for initiation of therapy are different from those for nonpregnant adults. These recommendations change regularly as safety and efficacy data become available.</p><p>Other guidelines that are relevant to resource-rich settings include those from the <a href=\"http://www.bhiva.org/documents/Guidelines/Pregnancy/2012/hiv1030_6.pdf&amp;token=srDXoyReDkWvsLxKXzl0NIOH1iEv31obf9mcFGNmxIGRINGWiGprNkeCgOO+6gvKpHLrfxPz7zRQZW8DMoIFhG98T6TZQSpgKBr89ojjwBA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15799\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">British HIV Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.eacsociety.org/Portals/0/Guidelines_Online_131014.pdf&amp;token=/ojvMRnG8olqqAXgAP7GAlRUCV1G3pSXW+fpyZLHAJ3flOb3SAZC85sTUD+PE+SxNjiH8+F8r6xb19UgM7AhoBoaqxGEmdAIjwzsFXSJptg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15799\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">European AIDS Clinical Society</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Information regarding antepartum evaluation and teratogenicity and the pharmacokinetics of individual agents during pregnancy is found elsewhere.

All pregnant HIV-infected women should receive combination ART, regardless of CD4 cell count or plasma HIV RNA copy number, to prevent perinatal transmission. The combination of maternal antepartum, maternal intrapartum, and infant prophylaxis is recommended to maximize infant pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis and suppress maternal viral load below the limit of detection throughout pregnancy to decrease the risk of transmission. In resource-rich countries, with widespread use of ART during pregnancy, the incidence of perinatal transmission of HIV is estimated at less than 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1-3,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6-9</a>].</p><p>Decisions about the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy should be made by the woman following discussion with her health care provider of the potential benefits and risks of therapy. Clinicians in the United States wishing to discuss management options may consider calling the National Perinatal HIV Consultation and Referral Service at the University of California, San Francisco: 1-888-448-8765.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328751\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV viremia and risk of infant infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the risk of perinatal transmission declines with decreasing levels of maternal HIV RNA (eg, &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> although there is still some element of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>In a prospective cohort study, HIV RNA levels were serially measured in 1542 HIV-infected women who gave birth from 1990 to 2000 to assess the relationship between plasma viremia, the type of therapeutic intervention, and the risk of HIV perinatal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].The risk of HIV transmission declined with lower levels of maternal viremia at delivery. HIV transmission rates ranged from 1 percent for patients with a non-detectable viral load (&lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> compared with 23 percent for those with a viral load &gt;30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. Even at low levels of viremia, the risk decreases with further reductions. In a study of 8075 HIV-infected women who received antepartum ART in France between 2000 and 2011, the odds of perinatal transmission were fourfold higher (95% CI 1.9-8.2) for women with a viral load of 50 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> at delivery compared with those with a viral load &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (1.5 percent when a viral load was 50 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> versus 0.3 percent when a delivery viral load was &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The transmission rate was 2.8 percent among women with a viral load &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>.</p><p>These data support the use of ART with the goal of full viral suppression to decrease the risk of perinatal HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These data also highlight the fact that women with a very low viral load can still transmit HIV to their infants, although the risk is low. This residual risk may be related to the presence of detectable HIV in the genital secretions. Thus, ART is recommended in all pregnant women for the prevention of perinatal transmission, regardless of the mother&rsquo;s viral load.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328983\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of ART in preventing transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have documented the efficacy of antiretroviral use in decreasing the risk of mother to child HIV transmission. In 1994, AIDS Clinical Trial 076 evaluated the safety and efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> prophylaxis in preventing perinatal transmission among 477 HIV-infected pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Zidovudine was administered during the antepartum and intrapartum period to the mother and in the infant for the first six weeks of life. Women who were randomly assigned to the intervention arm had a significantly lower risk of transmitting HIV infection to their newborn (25 versus 8 percent) with minimal toxic side effects.</p><p>After this landmark trial conducted in the United States and France, many subsequent clinical studies of HIV perinatal transmission have been performed in resource-limited settings to determine if lower-cost medications could be used or if alternative strategies could be as effective. Much of these data are not directly applicable to resource-rich countries due to varying HIV genotypes, patient populations, and infant feeding practices. However, illustrative concepts have emerged from these clinical trials that are also instructive for management of patients in resource-rich settings (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings#H23154897\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in resource-limited settings&quot;, section on 'Efficacy of maternal ART in preventing transmission'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination regimen is more effective in reducing HIV transmission than a single-drug regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A three-part strategy (ie, antepartum, intrapartum, and infant prophylaxis) is more effective than giving medications only during the intrapartum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postpartum periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) earlier in pregnancy is more effective in reducing perinatal transmission than starting late in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,19</a>].

For treatment-na&iuml;ve women, earlier initiation of ART is associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression by the time of delivery and decreased risk of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19-22</a>]. Thus, we recommend initiation of ART as soon as HIV is diagnosed in a pregnant woman or as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed in untreated women with an established HIV diagnosis.</p><p>Drug resistance testing is indicated prior to ART initiation for all individuals with detectable virus, but ART should be initiated prior to the availability of those results. Because a single mutation is associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors whereas multiple mutations are required for resistance to protease inhibitors, one of the preferred protease inhibitor-based ART regimens may be preferable for initial ART in treatment-na&iuml;ve pregnant women in such circumstances due to lower likelihood of pre-existing resistance. (See <a href=\"#H236824779\" class=\"local\">'Drug resistance testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H328768\" class=\"local\">'Antiretroviral selection and management'</a> below.)</p><p>For pregnant women who are not yet on ART, the rate of virologic control after initiation of ART appears comparable to that in nonpregnant women. As an example, in a study of 519 treatment-na&iuml;ve pregnant women initiating ART, 93 percent had achieved a HIV viral level &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> by the third month of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Available data additionally suggest that earlier initiation of ART is associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression by the time of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>]. In a cohort of 671 ART-na&iuml;ve pregnant women in the United States who initiated ART during pregnancy, a detectable viral load (&gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> at delivery was documented in 13 percent and was associated with antiretroviral initiation at a later gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Twenty-four percent of women who initiated the regimen during the third trimester had a detectable viral load.</p><p>Accordingly, earlier ART initiation is associated with a lower risk of perinatal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20</a>]. A study of 8075 women who received antepartum ART in France between 2000 and 2011 found an overall rate of transmission of 0.7 percent; no transmission occurred among 2651 infants born to women who received ART before conception, continued ART throughout pregnancy, and had a viral load &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Regardless of viral load, the transmission rate increased from 0.2 percent for women receiving ART before conception to 0.4, 0.9, and 2.2 percent for women initiating ART in the first, second, or third trimester.</p><p>Some women may prefer delaying ART until after completion of the first trimester, when the fetus is less susceptible to the potential teratogenic effects of medications. However, later initiation of ART may be less effective in reducing in utero transmission of HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, if ART is delayed beyond 28 weeks gestation, HIV RNA may not be fully suppressed by the time of delivery, which may increase the risk of perinatal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

For women initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy, regimen selection is similar to that for nonpregnant patients, with the exception that certain agents that are preferred in the general HIV-infected population (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elvitegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elvitegravir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a>) are not preferred in pregnancy because of limited clinical experience <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of pharmacokinetic data to inform appropriate dosing during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H236823808\" class=\"local\">'Preferred antiretroviral agents'</a> below.)

Most of the data that are available are focused on the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral medications in preventing infant transmission, as opposed to the efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of HIV in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

ART should be initiated in pregnant women prior to receiving the results of the resistance testing; if necessary, the regimen can be subsequently modified based on the results of the resistance assay. This is particularly important if the mother presents late for care, as the risk of perinatal transmission is associated with the duration of antenatal ART and level of viral suppression at delivery. (See <a href=\"#H328743\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate ART during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that drug resistance testing may not be feasible if the viral load is low (eg, &lt;500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span>.

Other factors that inform the regimen selection are patient factors such as adherence potential, tolerability, other comorbidities, and pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy. Some of the preferred regimens in nonpregnant adults lack data on pharmacokinetics during pregnancy; hence, preferred regimens for pregnant women differ somewhat from those for the general HIV-infected adult population. </p><p>The following describes our approach to regimen selection for a pregnant woman without evidence or suspicion of drug resistance, for whom a preferred NRTI combination backbone with a third preferred agent is appropriate. It is important to note that this is one approach, and there may be other appropriate reasons to choose a particular preferred agent over another.

Because abacavir-lamivudine should only be used in patients who are negative for the HLA-B5701 allele and testing may take several days to obtain the result, this regimen is less desirable for initiation during pregnancy, particularly if the patient presents late in gestation. </p><p>For women with hepatitis B virus coinfection, a TDF-containing combination is preferred because of its activity against hepatitis B virus.

One consideration for deciding whether to use a protease inhibitor in pregnancy is the conflicting data regarding risk of preterm birth; for women who are at very high risk of preterm birth, such as those with a history of multiple spontaneous preterm births, we may avoid protease inhibitor-containing regimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy#H98761537\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety and dosing of antiretroviral medications in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Preterm birth'</a>.)</p><p>Atazanavir-ritonavir is a good protease inhibitor option because it is administered once daily and thus minimizes problems with adherence. Additionally, there is now extensive experience with this drug in pregnancy, and it is well-tolerated, but it can cause asymptomatic maternal indirect hyperbilirubinemia. There has been some experience with darunavir-ritonavir use in pregnancy; although it must be given twice daily in pregnancy, it is well tolerated. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lopinavir-ritonavir</a> is no longer considered a preferred agent in pregnancy and is an alternative regimen because of tolerability problems with nausea.

It is particularly useful when there are concerns about drug interactions with protease inhibitor-based regimens. However, it must be administered twice daily in pregnancy. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dolutegravir</a> is an alternative integrase inhibitor to use in pregnancy because of limited data, although emerging evidence on its use in pregnancy is reassuring. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elvitegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Elvitegravir</a> is not recommended for use during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H115529661\" class=\"local\">'Integrase inhibitors'</a> below and <a href=\"#H236823994\" class=\"local\">'Other antiretroviral agents'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Efavirenz</a> is no longer a preferred third agent because it has been associated with exacerbation of mental health disorders and central nervous symptoms. Nevertheless, efavirenz coformulated with TDF-FTC remains an appropriate option for women who cannot use protease inhibitors and would benefit from a once-daily, single pill regimen. (See <a href=\"#H236824329\" class=\"local\">'Alternative agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H236820233\"><span class=\"h3\">On ART with viral suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With rare exceptions, women who have achieved viral suppression on ART that was initiated before pregnancy should continue their current regimen during pregnancy, provided that they tolerate it, even if the agents are not one of the preferred antiretroviral drugs for use during pregnancy. Certain agents, in particular protease inhibitors, may warrant dosing changes during pregnancy to compensate for pharmacokinetic changes during that time. (See <a href=\"#H328836\" class=\"local\">'Protease inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>The main exception to this approach is elvitegravir-cobicistat. Because of emerging data suggesting decreased drug levels during pregnancy and an associated risk of loss of virologic suppression, this agent is not recommended for initiation during pregnancy pending further data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>]. The optimal management of women who become pregnant while on a suppressive elvitegravir-cobicistat-containing regimen is uncertain. We suggest switching to a different regimen, choosing among preferred and alternative agents for use in pregnancy, guided by the treatment history and results of prior resistance testing. However, for women with barriers to switching (eg, a very strong preference for a once-daily regimen and inability to use a different one), it is reasonable to continue an elvitegravir-cobicistat-containing regimen after discussing the potential risks and the need for close viral monitoring.

In this case, the clinician must begin by asking the patient about their level of drug adherence. Nonadherence can result in incomplete viral suppression merely due to the lack of adequate drug level, even in the absence of drug resistance.</p><p>Drug resistance testing is also essential in this situation, and a new ART regimen should be tailored to the individual woman based on her resistance profile and individual medication tolerability. In such cases, agents that are not considered preferred antiretrovirals in pregnancy may be warranted (see <a href=\"#H236823808\" class=\"local\">'Preferred antiretroviral agents'</a> below and <a href=\"#H236823994\" class=\"local\">'Other antiretroviral agents'</a> below). Consultation with an expert in the management of drug-resistant HIV is recommended in such cases. If resistance to the current drugs in the ART regimen is not detected and suboptimal adherence is felt to have contributed to the failure to achieve viral suppression, a once-daily regimen would be particularly desirable. Alternatively, the original regimen could be continued along with intensive adherence counseling.

For such infants, four to six weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> prophylaxis is generally appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85990 \">table 3</a>). The shorter duration is for infants of mothers who had a suppressed viral load throughout pregnancy and no adherence concerns. The risk of transmission may be greater in women who have low but detectable viral loads and some other risk factor for transmission (such as concurrent sexually transmitted infection, genital ulcer disease, or obstetric issue that threatens excess bleeding). In such cases, combination ART, as is given for infants with higher risk of infection, may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H4199025919\" class=\"local\">'Mothers without viral suppression (&gt;1000 copies/mL)'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4199025919\"><span class=\"h2\">Mothers without viral suppression (&gt;1000 copies/mL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of a higher risk of HIV infection, infants should receive combination antiretroviral prophylaxis if their mothers have not received any ART during pregnancy, have received only intrapartum antiretrovirals, or have received antepartum ART but did not achieve viral suppression near delivery (ie, had a viral level &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span>. Options for combination prophylaxis include a two-drug (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> plus three doses of prophylactic-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> given within 48 hours of birth, 48 hours after the first dose, and 96 hours after second dose) or a three-drug regimen (zidovudine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, and treatment-dose [6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg]</span> nevirapine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We typically use the three-drug combination regimen at treatment doses for six weeks, if the infant can tolerate it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85990 \">table 3</a>). An alternative approach to this three-drug combination regimen, particularly if there are side effects or complications, is to discontinue the lamivudine and nevirapine components at two weeks if the HIV nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at birth was negative and continue zidovudine alone for the full six weeks. </p><p>The rationale for a combination antiretroviral regimen is to maximize the reduction in perinatal HIV transmission, but the optimal combination regimen is uncertain. Although evidence suggests that combination antiretroviral prophylaxis is better than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> monotherapy for such high-risk infants, there are no comparative data suggesting that this particular three-drug combination (zidovudine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, and treatment-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>) is superior to the two-drug regimen discussed above (zidovudine plus prophylactic-dose nevirapine). The decision to administer a three-drug regimen should be made in consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist, preferably before delivery, if possible, and should consider the balance between the transmission risk and potential neonatal toxicities for the individual infant, with parental counseling on these issues. </p><p>The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) <span class=\"nowrap\">040/Pediatric</span> AIDS Clinical Trial Group 1043 study is the only randomized trial evaluating combination prophylaxis in high risk infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It compared the efficacy of three infant prophylaxis regimens in preventing intrapartum mother-to-child transmission of HIV among infants to pregnant women who presented late to care and received only intrapartum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> or no antiretroviral agents. The rate of intrapartum transmission of HIV was higher when infants received six weeks of zidovudine alone (4.8 percent) compared with six weeks of zidovudine plus three prophylaxis-level doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a> over eight days (2.2 percent) or six weeks of zidovudine plus two weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> (2.4 percent). Neutropenia was more common with the triple drug regimen than the other two. Thus, the two-drug zidovudine plus nevirapine regimen offered the most favorable balance between efficacy and side effects. It is hypothesized but as yet unproven that replacing nelfinavir in the three-drug regimen with treatment-dose nevirapine, which has greater potency, and giving the regimen for a full six weeks would result in greater preventive efficacy that would offset the potential toxicity. Observational data suggest that this three-drug regimen (zidovudine, lamivudine, plus nevirapine) is associated with slightly lower hemoglobin levels and higher premature discontinuation rates compared with zidovudine only, but no major toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Clinical trials evaluating the impact of very early treatment on viral reservoirs in HIV-infected infants by treating high-risk HIV-exposed infants with the three-drug regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine at treatment doses will inform the pharmacokinetics and safety of this regimen in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Data from these studies will guide future recommendations. </p><p>Furthermore, the threshold viral level at which to prompt the use of combination infant prophylaxis is not definitively known.

This finding highlights the importance of careful adherence counseling and social support during the postpartum period in an effort to mitigate the risk of poor compliance among those who continue an antiretroviral regimen.</p><p>For women continuing ART postpartum, modification of the regimen may be appropriate if pregnancy-related factors led to selection of an ART regimen that contains agents that would not otherwise be used because of long term toxicity or convenience. Postpartum contraception should be ensured for women who continue on an efavirenz-containing regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785467045\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The combined use of maternal antepartum, maternal intrapartum, and infant antiretroviral prophylaxis maximizes infant pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis to decrease the risk of HIV acquisition. (See <a href=\"#H7448860\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected pregnant women has two separate but related purposes: reduction of perinatal transmission and treatment of maternal HIV disease. All pregnant HIV-infected women should receive combination ART, regardless of CD4 cell count or plasma HIV RNA copy number. (See <a href=\"#H7448867\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for maternal ART'</a> above and <a href=\"#H328751\" class=\"local\">'HIV viremia and risk of infant infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H328983\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of ART in preventing transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment-na&iuml;ve pregnant women, we recommend prompt initiation of ART regardless of gestational age (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Earlier initiation of an antiretroviral regimen is associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression by the time of delivery and thus decreased risk of transmission. (See <a href=\"#H328743\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate ART during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selecting a regimen that will be active against the patient&rsquo;s virus based on the resistance profile is the primary objective. Within that constraint, we generally favor agents with a documented history of safety in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F97684\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97684 \">table 1</a>). Other factors that inform the regimen selection are patient factors such as adherence potential, tolerability, other comorbidities, and pharmacokinetic data in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2033004\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-na&iuml;ve pregnant woman should be started on a regimen that consists of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone with either a protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor as a third drug. The individual agents should be chosen from those that are preferred in pregnancy because of their substantial clinical use and demonstrated efficacy during pregnancy. ART should be initiated after obtaining resistance testing and can be adjusted after results of a resistance profile of the virus are obtained, if applicable. (See <a href=\"#H236820049\" class=\"local\">'Treatment-na&iuml;ve'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-experienced women on a virologically suppressive ART regimen that they tolerate can usually continue that regimen, even if the individual agents are not preferred in pregnancy. However, for patients who become pregnant while on an elvitegravir-cobicistat-containing regimen, we suggest switching to a different regimen because of low drug levels and the potential for virologic failure during pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Stavudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a>, and full-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> should also not be continued during pregnancy, but these agents are rarely used in the general population. (See <a href=\"#H236820233\" class=\"local\">'On ART with viral suppression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In treatment-experienced women who are either not on an antiretroviral regimen or are on a failing regimen, antiretroviral selection will be mainly guided by the history of prior antiretroviral drug exposure and results of previous and current resistance testing. In such cases, use of agents that are not preferred in pregnancy may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H40726614\" class=\"local\">'On ART without viral suppression'</a> above and <a href=\"#H541026643\" class=\"local\">'Treatment experienced but not currently on ART'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiretroviral agents that are preferred in pregnancy include the NRTI combinations <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir-lamivudine</a>; the protease inhibitors ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> and ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>; and the integrase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>. Some protease inhibitors may warrant dosing alterations during pregnancy given pharmacokinetic changes. (See <a href=\"#H236823808\" class=\"local\">'Preferred antiretroviral agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be a small increased risk of preterm delivery and impaired fetal growth with the use of ART, particularly protease inhibitors, during pregnancy, but the data from studies are conflicting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-and-dosing-of-antiretroviral-medications-in-pregnancy#H98761068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety and dosing of antiretroviral medications in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy outcomes with combination ART exposure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who have a viral load &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> prior to 38 weeks gestation (eg, women not taking ART, women presenting late in pregnancy, or women not responding to their current ART regimen), we recommend pre-labor cesarean delivery to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110841\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110841 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The mode of delivery for women with viral load &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> on ART depends on obstetric indications alone. (See <a href=\"#H2152172955\" class=\"local\">'Mode of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women should continue taking their ART regimen during labor and delivery or scheduled cesarean delivery. For women who have HIV RNA &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> or unknown viral levels in late pregnancy and around the time of delivery, we recommend intrapartum intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> to further reduce the risk of perinatal transmission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110841\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110841 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For women who have had HIV RNA &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> consistently in late pregnancy and around the time of delivery and have no concerns related to adherence or resistance to the regimen, intrapartum intravenous zidovudine is not associated with further reduction of HIV transmission. (See <a href=\"#H8630301\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum antiretrovirals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis after birth to decrease the risk of HIV acquisition (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Infant antiretroviral prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within the first 6 to 12 hours of delivery. The precise prophylactic regimen depends on the mother&rsquo;s use of antepartum antiretroviral agents and her viral load near delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85990 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110841\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110841 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8627914\" class=\"local\">'Infant prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given recommendations for ART use in all HIV-infected patients, regardless of immune, clinical, or viral status, ART should be continued postpartum. Adherence to ART during the postpartum period may be particularly problematic for women, and it is important to provide careful adherence counseling and social support during the postpartum period to mitigate the risk of poor compliance.
