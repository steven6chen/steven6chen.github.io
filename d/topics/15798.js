The possibility of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is relevant to movement disorders because OSA has associations, for example, with disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and with sleep-related bruxism. </p><p>The steps above should give a provisional diagnosis. If the diagnosis is unclear, it may be helpful to have the parents provide video recordings of the behavior occurring in the home environment. If a specific pathologic disorder is suspected, further evaluation is performed, as needed. As an example, a patient with frequent bruxism should have a dental evaluation. In some cases, such as an unclear diagnosis or suspected sleep-related epilepsy, consultation with a sleep specialist or neurologist and nocturnal polysomnography, routine electroencephalography (EEG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 24-hour video-EEG telemetry as an inpatient may be required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H474427234\"><span class=\"h1\">SLEEP-RELATED MOVEMENT DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related movement disorders are characterized by relatively simple, usually stereotyped, movements that disturb sleep or its onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The simple and stereotyped nature of the movements distinguishes them from the complex movements associated with parasomnias (eg, sleepwalking) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107731 \">table 1</a>). Infrequent manifestations of these movements usually are benign variants, but they are classified as movement <strong>disorders</strong> when they are frequent or have pathologic consequences. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213553031\"><span class=\"h2\">Restless legs syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder in which patients complain of a sensation of a strong urge to move their limbs, which occurs when at rest and exclusively or predominantly in the evening or at night. Children in comparison with adults may use a wide variety of expressions, terms, or drawings to describe this underlying complaint. The diagnostic criteria are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86837 \">table 3</a>). RLS commonly interferes with sleep in both children and adults and is sometimes confused with &quot;growing pains&quot; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growing-pains\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growing pains&quot;</a>). A majority of children with RLS also have repetitive limb movements during sleep (known as periodic limb movements of sleep; PLMS), which is also a characteristic of the separate but related disorder, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMS tend to occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. </p><p>RLS or PLMD are often associated with iron deficiency and may be triggered or exacerbated by insufficient sleep, caffeine, nicotine, and some medications, including sedating antihistamines and serotonergic antidepressants. These disorders are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3760392288\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep-related leg cramps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related leg cramps are sudden and intense involuntary contractions of muscles (often in the calf) that tend to occur during sleep or while in bed. They may be idiopathic or secondary to other medical conditions. They are common and tend to become more frequent with advancing age. In children, these are typically benign, self-limited, and infrequent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nocturnal-leg-cramps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nocturnal leg cramps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4269398542\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep-related bruxism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bruxism is characterized by repetitive clenching or grinding of the teeth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bracing or thrusting of the mandible in sleep. It may occur in any of the three stages of NREM sleep (stage N1, N2, or N3). It is most common during childhood, and the prevalence decreases gradually with advancing age. Risk factors include comorbid sleep disorders, especially obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); anxiety and other psychiatric and neurologic disorders; and certain medications and substances, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and neuroleptic agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F112719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112719 \">table 4</a>). In particular, bruxism occurs with increased frequency in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], and it is unclear whether this is an independent association, or one that is mediated by the medications used to treat the disorder (eg, stimulants). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding#H984894541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related bruxism (tooth grinding)&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Bruxism that occurs infrequently does not need treatment. Bruxism that occurs frequently (eg, nightly) and is severe may warrant treatment with devices, such as occlusal splints, that limit wear and tear on the teeth. Treatment of OSA with adenotonsillectomy may improve the bruxism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The diagnosis and management of sleep-related bruxism is discussed separately.

The term rhythmic movement <strong>disorder</strong><em> </em>is used if the movements have or are likely to have significant consequences, such as self-injury or interference with normal sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The episodes occur in up to 60 percent of nine-month-old infants and generally resolve spontaneously by five years of age. Rarely, they persist or begin later in childhood or adulthood. Most studies in children have found no sex difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The most common manifestations are body rocking, head rolling (side to side), or head banging (also known as jactatio capitis nocturna), sometimes accompanied by rhythmic humming or inarticulate sounds. Less common are rolling movements of the body or legs or leg banging. In most cases, the child has no recollection of the movements; they are more of a concern to the parents, who may bring up the behavior with the clinician. Most episodes occur at sleep onset and during NREM sleep (especially stages N1 and N2), but a substantial minority occur during REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rhythmic movements most likely represent a release from the descending, suprasegmental inhibition that is normally exercised by the cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Sleep-related rhythmic movements should be distinguished from the motor stereotypies of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as autism spectrum disorder, which may occur during both wakefulness and sleep. There is no satisfactory treatment, and the movements may gradually resolve spontaneously over time. In cases of forceful head banging, extra padding of the sides of the crib may be required to prevent injury to the child. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H943426181\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This condition is characterized by repetitive myoclonic jerks of the limbs or the trunk during sleep in infants younger than six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The jerks are typically bilateral, symmetric movements of the arms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> legs. The condition is uncommon and benign and tends to resolve spontaneously. </p><p>The phenomenon is probably due to maturation of inhibitory motor projections from the cerebral cortex to generators of these movements that are located in the brainstem or spinal cord. Features that help distinguish these myoclonic jerks from epileptic events include the absence of autonomic disturbances, myoclonic jerks occurring only while asleep, and a normal electroencephalography (EEG) and neurologic and developmental examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-infancy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in infancy&quot;, section on 'Benign myoclonus of infancy'</a>.)</p><p>Infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome) often have similar myoclonic jerks, and their clinical course may not be benign. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-abstinence-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal abstinence syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3943544643\"><span class=\"h1\">ISOLATED SYMPTOMS AND NORMAL VARIANTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3117626415\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep starts (hypnic jerks)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are abrupt, startle-like movements that occur as one is drifting off to sleep, sometimes accompanied by a sensation of falling, a dream-like feeling, or a flashing sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. They are physiologic and are common at all ages. Most of the jerks are isolated, but in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, they may occur in clusters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Their frequency may be increased by caffeine or other stimulants, prior intense physical exercise, sleep deprivation, or emotional stress.</p><p>Hypnic jerks might be mistaken for seizures, but usually can be distinguished clinically. If an electroencephalogram (EEG) is performed, the findings are normal. No treatment is needed for hypnic starts as they are a benign, physiologic entity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4141822744\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypnagogic foot tremor and alternating leg muscle activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnagogic foot tremor is a rhythmic movement of the feet or toes, occurring around the time of sleep onset with a periodicity of once every one to two seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It may involve one or both feet and may last several minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The patient may perceive a sensation of movement of the feet. This is a benign entity that is seen in both children and adults. In a study of 375 consecutive patients undergoing polysomnography (adults and children), hypnic foot tremor was documented to occur in 28 subjects (7.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The condition may come to attention during the course of investigation for other sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome (RLS). The simultaneously obtained EEG is normal, thus excluding the possibility of seizures. There are no known adverse consequences, and the disorder likely resolves spontaneously over time.</p><p>Alternating leg muscle activation (ALMA) is characterized by an alternating pattern of tibialis anterior muscle activation on the nocturnal polysomnogram, in which 1 to 2 Hz muscle activations lasting 0.1 to 0.5 seconds are organized into sequences lasting up to 20 seconds. ALMA is likely generated at the level of the spinal cord and results from a loss of descending motor dopaminergic inhibition that is normally exercised on the spinal cord. It may occur with use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and in conjunction with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and periodic limb movements of sleep. There may be simultaneous accelerations in heart rate. The cause and management of ALMA remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1589571804\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS FROM OTHER CATEGORIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504107321\"><span class=\"h2\">Catathrenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catathrenia (also known as sleep-related groaning) is characterized by a deep inspiration, followed by a prolonged, low-pitched groaning noise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. There may be several episodes on a given night. Sleep is not disrupted, and the condition is more bothersome to the parent or family member than the patient. Because of the prolonged expiration, this is categorized as a sleep-related breathing disorder, but there is no oxygen desaturation or hypoventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Video monitoring is able to successfully capture these events. Most episodes occur in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but they occasionally occur during non-REM (NREM) sleep. The disorder is benign and there is no satisfactory treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep#H531604249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep&quot;, section on 'Vocalization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4280427457\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep-related epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a reciprocal relationship between sleep and epilepsy. Sleep tends to facilitate epileptiform discharges and seizures, perhaps because sleep is associated with synchronized electroencephalography patterns. Conversely, epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, or both may also disrupt sleep quality, such that the prevalence of sleep problems in patients with epilepsy is approximately twice that of the general population (38 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Further, patients with epilepsy and their relatives show a higher prevalence of arousal (NREM) parasomnias as compared with controls (odds ratio [OR] 6.3 and 4.7, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes that occur in the <strong>absence</strong> of daytime seizures include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes&quot;</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign (childhood) epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common of these three entities. The disorder has a peak incidence between seven and nine years of age, and seizures occur only during sleep in approximately 80 percent of patients. The seizures may occur at random times of the night. The child awakens with twitching movements of one side of the face. Consciousness is preserved. Left hemispheric onset of the seizure may be associated with &quot;ictal aphasia.&quot; Neurodevelopment is normal, as is the neurologic examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;, section on 'Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) or nocturnal temporal lobe epilepsy (NTLE) are uncommon sleep-related epilepsy syndromes that tend to begin during adolescence. They are notable because they are sometimes difficult to distinguish clinically from parasomnias or other sleep-related movement disorders. Features that help to distinguish these disorders from other nocturnal paroxysmal disorders are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60188\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60188 \">table 5</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>NFLE is also known as sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SRHE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Associated movements may include paroxysmal arousals, dystonic limb posturing, or hyper-motor behavior, which may be in the form of kicking, thrashing, or pedaling movements that may resemble disorders of arousal, nightmares, or panic attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-movement-disorders-in-childhood/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, a key distinguishing feature of NFLE, as opposed to other diagnostic considerations, is the highly stereotyped nature of the specific movements from episode to episode. The seizures tend to occur randomly through the night and have abrupt onset and offset, with duration generally of only a few seconds. This is in contrast with parasomnias, such as sleepwalking or confusional arousals, which may last two to five minutes and are somewhat more likely to occur in the first third of the night. However, in some patients, NFLE events may be longer and include ambulatory behavior that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from sleepwalking. The disorder can be genetic (autosomal dominant NFLE) or neurodevelopmental.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In NTLE, episodes also may include automatisms mimicking a confusional arousal or nocturnal wandering that resembles sleepwalking. A majority of patients awaken from sleep with a seizure aura that progresses to a focal seizure.

The simple and stereotyped nature of the movements distinguish them from the complex movements associated with parasomnias (eg, sleepwalking). Infrequent manifestations of these movements usually are benign variants, but they are classified as movement <strong>disorders</strong> when they are frequent or have pathologic consequences. (See <a href=\"#H314460315\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a child with sleep-related movements that concern the parents or are problematic starts with a careful description of the behavior and a history of sleeping and waking function. In some cases, the diagnosis can be facilitated by video recordings of sleep at home and occasionally requires assessment in a sleep laboratory with polysomnography. (See <a href=\"#H1271967900\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that causes a sensation of a strong urge to move the limbs, mainly when at rest, and exclusively or predominantly in the evening or at night (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86837 \">table 3</a>). Children may use a wide variety of expressions, terms, or pictures to describe this sensation. RLS is a common cause of sleep disruption in both children and adults. (See <a href=\"#H213553031\" class=\"local\">'Restless legs syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhythmic movements of the head, neck, and trunk associated with sleep are common and likely developmental (physiologic) in infants and young children. The most common manifestations are body rocking, head rolling (side to side), or head banging, sometimes accompanied by rhythmic humming or inarticulate sounds. The episodes occur in up to 60 percent of nine-month-old infants and generally resolve spontaneously by five years of age. The term rhythmic movement <strong>disorder</strong> is used if the movements have or are likely to have significant consequences, such as self-injury. (See <a href=\"#H2179845299\" class=\"local\">'Rhythmic movement disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep starts (hypnic jerks) are common at all ages and are considered normal. They tend to occur at the time of sleep onset. (See <a href=\"#H3943544643\" class=\"local\">'Isolated symptoms and normal variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, sleep-related epilepsy syndromes can mimic sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. In particular, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE, also known as sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy [SRHE]), may include complex but highly stereotyped movements, such as paroxysmal arousals, dystonic limb posturing, or hyper-motor behavior, such as kicking, thrashing, or pedaling movements.
