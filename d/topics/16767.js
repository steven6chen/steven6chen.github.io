Brain metastases are being diagnosed more often, due to both improved detection of small metastases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a true increase in incidence resulting from improved systemic therapy of extracranial disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historically, the primary approaches to the treatment of patients with brain metastases have been surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, as systemic therapies for various cancer types have improved, immunotherapy and targeted therapies are increasingly integrated into the management of patients with brain metastases from diseases like melanoma and oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and treatment decisions must be multidisciplinary and individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-brain-metastases-from-solid-tumors/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The roles of various factors that determine responsiveness to systemic treatment will be reviewed here, along with the efficacy and risks of such treatment in the tumors that most commonly metastasize to the brain. The use of WBRT, SRS, and surgery in the management of brain metastases is discussed elsewhere, as is the treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

However, the blood-brain barrier is often disrupted at the site of large metastases, as evidenced by contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-brain-metastases-from-solid-tumors/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>].
