Both visualize and guide sampling of mediastinal structures and lymph nodes, but EUS is performed during endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract and EBUS is performed during bronchoscopy. They are complimentary; EBUS is used to examine the anterior mediastinum while EUS is used to examine the posterior mediastinum. Both procedures should only be performed by a skilled endoscopist (pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, surgeon), who has undergone appropriate training.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy#H1213982080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)&quot;, section on 'Patient preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients do not need to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories when undergoing EUS-guided sampling. The management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in those undergoing endoscopy is typically individualized, managed in conjunction with the prescribing subspecialist, and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-antiplatelet-agents-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-procedures-in-patients-with-disorders-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic procedures in patients with disorders of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of those who are undergoing EUS-guided sampling for mediastinal cysts, most patients do not need prophylactic antibiotics. Based upon the higher than usual risk of infection in those with mediastinal cystic lesions, prophylactic antibiotics are typically administered in this population both before and for three to five days after the procedure is performed. Indications and suggested regimens for antibiotic prophylaxis are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F99536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99536 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54121 \">table 2</a>).

The echoendoscope is flexible, approximately 11 to 13 mm in diameter depending on the type of scope (radial or linear), and can obtain reliable images at a depth ranging from 3 mm to 8 cm from the transducer. Two types of echoendoscopes exist, radial and curvilinear:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radial echoendoscope provides a 360-degree ultrasound image of the gastrointestinal tract and surrounding structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76193\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76193 \">image 1</a>). It is purely a diagnostic tool. The radial EUS scope readily images lesions such as submucosal lesions of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum as the layers of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum are clearly seen. This scope allows the endoscopist to identify target lesions quickly, and also provides a familiar cross sectional view such as seen with computed tomography (CT). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The curvilinear echoendoscope provides a 180-degree view that is parallel to the shaft of the echoendoscope, thereby allowing real-time visualization of the fine needle during the tissue sampling. Color flow and Doppler features of the curvilinear echoendoscope also permit identification of vascular, ductular (such as biliary and pancreatic ducts), and cystic structures, which is important prior to fine needle aspiration (biopsy) since samples cannot be obtained if there are intervening blood vessels in the path of the fine needle aspiration (biopsy) needle. Landmarks in the mediastinum may be more difficult to see fully depending on the experience of the endoscopist. (See <a href=\"#H123584395\" class=\"local\">'Sampling'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2359774895\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure involves sonographic imaging through the esophagus to look for the typical anatomic landmarks and identify target abnormalities for sampling. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3704116407\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure begins once the patient is adequately sedated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The <strong>radial </strong>echoendoscope is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach until the tip reaches the duodenum. It is then withdrawn slowly in 1 to 2 cm increments while ultrasound imaging is performed. Anatomic landmarks and sonographic abnormalities are typically recorded. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper retroperitoneum is visualized through the gastric wall, including the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, left adrenal gland, right adrenal gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], left lobe of the liver, and other retroperitoneal structures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior mediastinum is visualized through the esophageal wall. The heart, pleura, spine, and vascular structures can be readily identified. In addition, mediastinal lymph nodes may be visualized in the subcarina (level 7), the paraesophageal area (level 8), adjacent to the inferior pulmonary ligament (level 9), and, possibly, the aortopulmonary window (level 5) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63771 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 2</a>). Abnormalities may also be detected in the paratracheal areas (levels 2 and 4) and adjacent to the ascending aorta (level 6) if they are large enough. In general, only abnormal sites are sampled. </p><p/><p>If fine needle aspiration is needed, the <strong>radial</strong> echoendoscope is withdrawn and a <strong>curvilinear</strong> echoendoscope is advanced to the desired location for the purposes of fine needle aspiration or biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">(FNA/FNB)</span>. Color flow and Doppler imaging are used prior to sampling to ensure that there are no intervening blood vessels, which is a contraindication for EUS-guided sampling. (See <a href=\"#H123584395\" class=\"local\">'Sampling'</a> below.)</p><p>The duration of the procedure is typically 30 to 60 minutes. It is usually performed as an outpatient procedure.</p><p>Although EUS can readily image and identify mediastinal abnormalities, sonographic features alone are not reliable to distinguish between malignant or benign conditions. Thus, fine needle aspiration is performed if there is any uncertainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective review of 162 patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes including lesions that were benign (68), due to sarcoidosis (33), lymphoma (20), or metastases (41), the median long axis was shorter in the benign group compared with metastases and sarcoid groups (21 versus 28 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; however, echocardiography features of the lymph nodes were not reliable in differentiating between the groups. Thus, FNA is recommended when feasible. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of 113 patients compared EUS characteristics of tubercular and reactive lymphadenopathy. EUS findings that were more commonly seen in tuberculosis included hypoechoic echotexture, patchy <span class=\"nowrap\">anechoic/hypoechoic</span> areas, calcification, sharply demarcated borders, exudative material on aspirate, conglomeration of lymph nodes, and larger size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, these findings were also seen in patients with reactive lymphadenopathy, albeit less frequently, and were therefore not specific. In addition, some of these features also overlap with features of malignancy (eg, well-defined borders, hypoechoic appearance). Again, FNA is recommended when feasible. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H123584395\"><span class=\"h3\">Sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue samples can be obtained via FNA or core biopsy (FNB). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Fine needle aspiration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H28833841\" class=\"local\">'EUS-guided core biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Choosing among these options varies at the discretion of the operator and is influenced by endoscopist experience and institutional practice. The advantage of core biopsy sampling is that typically larger pieces of tissue may be obtained in one pass. This may increase diagnostic yield and reduce sampling time (eg, useful if cytogenetics is planned) depending on the targeted lesion. One study suggested similar sensitivity between a 22-gauge core biopsy needle (EUS-FNB) and standard EUS-FNA, but the core needle required fewer passes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, most needles have not been adequately compared, and we believe that the choice of needle should be individualized. In a retrospective study of 250 EUS-FNB lesions, some of which were mediastinal, a diagnosis was achieved in over 80 percent with a median number of three passes. This yield was 69 percent if rapid onsite cytologic assistance was not used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>EUS-FNA samples, have been successfully used to detect lung cancer-associated mutations such as epidermal growth factor receptor and k-ras. These are important for predicting therapeutic response to chemotherapeutic drugs (eg, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and tailoring management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h4\">Fine needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technical procedure of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is similar to that used for EUS-guided aspiration of gastrointestinal lesions, which is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H109379202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.)</p><p>In brief, once the target lesion has been identified and no intervening blood vessels are seen, a 22- or 25-gauge fine aspiration needle is passed through the working channel of the curvilinear echoendoscope. Under direct ultrasound guidance, the needle is directed through the wall of the esophagus and into the target. Aspiration is then performed by simultaneously moving the needle in a to and fro motion inside the target lesion while applying negative pressure using a 10 or 20 mL syringe. Following removal of the aspiration needle, air is forced through the needle using the same syringe, which expels the aspirated sample onto a glass slide. Two direct smears are usually made from a single pass; one slide is dried with 0.95 alcohol for cytologic analysis in the laboratory, while the other slide is stained for rapid on-site interpretation (ROSE) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76828\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76828 \">image 2</a>). Multiple passes can be performed to enhance the diagnostic yield as well as for special staining, cell block preparation, or for microbiology purposes. The same procedure can be used to aspirate tissue for microbiologic analysis, except the aspirate is placed in a small amount of sterile saline. In general, the same needle is used for each pass unless the needle comes in contact with formalin.

The needles range in size from 25- to 19-gauge.&nbsp;Compared with EUS-FNA, the goal of EUS-FNB is to obtain a core of tissue with preserved architecture. The technique of obtaining a core biopsy sample is similar to that of EUS-FNA. However, a vacuum suction is applied for 60 seconds prior to one or two to and fro motions. The core can be smeared on a glass slide for rapid onsite interpretation. Multiple passes can also be done to enhance the diagnostic yield. Core samples can also be submitted in formalin for formal pathologic interpretation or in sterile saline for culture. In our experience, the risks of bleeding are similar to EUS-FNA. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H501857049\"><span class=\"h2\">Post procedure care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the procedure, patients are recovered from sedation or anesthesia. A chest radiograph or computed tomography of the chest is not routinely performed unless pneumomediastinum from esophageal perforation is suspected or a patient develops symptoms of a complication (eg, chest pain, dyspnea, fever). Air is not routinely seen after EUS-FNA or EUS-FNB. A fever after the procedure is not typical and warrants further investigation. The equipment is cleaned per procedural protocol.

EUS-guided sampling (EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB) is best suited to target lesions that are within the esophageal wall, adjacent to the esophageal wall, in the posterior mediastinum, or in the inferior mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63771 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>EUS is <strong>not</strong> suitable for lesions in the anterior or superior mediastinum. Since it is minimally invasive, EUS is performed on outpatient basis with conscious or deep sedation. EUS-guided sampling may be preferred over surgical approaches in patients who are not surgical candidates. In addition, EUS-FNA may be an alternative modality for obtaining pleural fluid or tissue in extrathoracic sites including the celiac lymph nodes, left adrenal gland, upper retroperitoneum, and left lobe of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-sampling-of-the-mediastinum-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>].
