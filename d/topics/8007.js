Speech and language delays secondary to hearing loss are often preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Thus, early identification of hearing loss, whether it is permanent (usually sensorineural) or temporary (usually conductive), is the key to a child's success with communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Significant hearing loss occurs in 1 to 2 per 1000 newborns and in 2 per 1000 young children. However, nearly all children develop transient hearing loss related to middle ear infections during the period from birth to 11 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

It &quot;catches&quot; incoming sound waves and then funnels them down the EAC. Sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane, causing motion of the ossicles that results in a piston-like effect on the stapes. Stapedial motion is transmitted to the inner ear fluid as a traveling wave that propagates around the two and one-half turns of the cochlea. Frequency-specific movement of the organ of Corti bends the stereocilia, causing depolarization of the inner hair cells and creating electrical impulses transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain. The brain organizes the information into what we perceive as complex sounds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing loss may be classified as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conductive, involving any cause that in some way limits the amount of external sound that gains access to the inner ear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorineural, involving the inner ear, cochlea, or the auditory nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed, which is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central (involving higher brain centers) and auditory dyssynchrony (also called auditory neuropathy or auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder).</p><p/><p>Numerous abnormalities can lead to hearing loss of each type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDUCTIVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conductive losses imply a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear: the pinna, external canal, tympanic membrane, or ossicles. Examples include cerumen impaction, middle ear fluid, and ossicular chain fixation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Outer ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital anomalies, infections, and trauma to the outer ear can cause conductive hearing loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external auditory canal (EAC) develops from the 8<sup>th</sup> to the 28<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. Problems can occur anytime during this developmental phase. Microtia, the absence or malformation of the auricle, may be associated with mild to moderate conductive hearing loss, whereas atresia or significant stenosis of the EAC causes moderate to maximal (60 decibels [dB]) conductive hearing loss. It is possible to have a normal auricle, but an atretic canal. Unilateral atresia or significant stenosis of the EAC is much more common than is bilateral atresia.</p><p>Congenital abnormalities of the outer ear may occur in isolation or may be part of a broader clinical syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115370\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115370 \">table 2</a>). Outer ear malformations are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-ear#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the ear&quot;, section on 'Outer ear malformations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687404\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The EAC may be obstructed by cerumen or by bony growths, such as osteomas or exostoses. Thus, it is important to clear the EAC of cerumen for accurate pediatric audiologic testing. Osteomas are benign solitary smooth-round osseous lesions occurring at the tympanosquamous and tympanomastoid suture lines inside the bony EAC. These lesions usually present in middle age, although they may also occur in children. Exostoses are benign broad-based osseous lesions often presenting after a history of chronic cold water exposure (eg, cold water swimming). These lesions are often multiple and bilateral, are usually diagnosed in teenagers or young adults, and are far more common in males.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections can lead to blockage of the EAC caused by the accumulation of debris, edema, or inflammation. Otitis externa can develop after local EAC trauma or impacted cerumen becomes contaminated by bacteria (or occasionally fungi) after swimming, showering, or exposure to hot and humid conditions. The canal is often filled with squamous and purulent debris, and significant edema of the EAC occurs. The most common symptoms are otalgia (often severe), pruritus, discharge, and hearing loss.

Ossicular and other middle ear malformations occur as part of syndromes (eg, <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/154500&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFdq7KW313yBvat27CnEqDw9GOUvwZSDpMo1gtEJ2PM9w&amp;TOPIC_ID=6308\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Treacher-Collins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/113650&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFeFrwBDjxb9nersO1+vrxP9BX8FK+srNYDMSEQUxmyCR&amp;TOPIC_ID=6308\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">branchio-oto-renal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/108300&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFRc/Q/dLCs5TziGRc/5rLwhZbcurPGWxtgCxKYjUwhNT&amp;TOPIC_ID=6308\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Stickler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/192430&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFQdsXnRDd5WxpnJNX2h2G8P+ZTaa/q6iwZl2Z8iqDnum&amp;TOPIC_ID=6308\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">velocardiofacial (DiGeorge)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/130650&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFc6jRLzqNN8gxZwGEOirhGkxIaK/RZdv2LrKgyNDqO3u&amp;TOPIC_ID=6308\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Beckwith-Wiedemann</a>) and occasionally as isolated events. They may or may not be associated with EAC stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microtia.</p><p>The most common abnormalities of the ossicles are fixation of the malleus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incus, incudostapedial discontinuity, and stapes fixation. These defects in the middle ear's conducting mechanism cause hearing losses ranging from minor to maximal (60 dB) and have important effects on communication and learning.</p><p>Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant condition associated with fragile bones that fracture easily. Children with this disorder may develop ossicular dislocation, stapes fixation, or fracture of the ossicles, resulting in a conductive hearing loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common childhood disorder associated with conductive hearing loss. By the age of three years, most children will experience at least one episode of AOM, and many will have experienced at least three episodes (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Conductive hearing loss occurs in AOM because fluid filling the middle ear space prevents the tympanic membrane from vibrating adequately, thereby diminishing movement of the ossicular chain. The hearing loss persists as long as fluid fills the middle ear space. The median loss is 25 dB, which is similar to putting plugs in the child's ears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H22228262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Hearing loss'</a>.)</p><p>Despite adequate therapy, middle ear effusion persists in many patients, a condition called otitis media with effusion (OME) or serous otitis media. In most cases, OME resolves spontaneously over approximately six weeks. Some children, particularly those at risk for speech delays or learning problems, may benefit from tympanostomy tube placement. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Tympanic membrane perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conductive hearing loss caused by tympanic membrane perforation is common. The degree of conductive hearing loss depends upon the size and location of the perforation. Small perforations and those located in the <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/inferior</span> quadrant cause a lesser degree of conductive hearing loss. Near-total or <span class=\"nowrap\">posterior/superior</span> quadrant perforations are more likely to cause significant hearing loss.</p><p>Tympanic membrane perforations can be caused by many events, including blast injury, barotrauma, foreign body trauma, temporal bone fractures, ear infections, self-inflicted trauma from a Q-tip or other object (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67932\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67932 \">picture 1</a>), or the hole may persist after tympanostomy tubes fall out. After an acute perforation, the ear should be examined to ensure that the perforation heals without cholesteatoma formation. Documentation of a patient's auditory status also is mandatory for any newly-diagnosed perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt trauma can lead to temporal bone fracture, usually by a blow to the temporal parietal region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59595\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59595 \">image 1</a>). Hearing loss due to temporal bone fracture is typically conductive and associated with tympanic membrane perforations and blood in the middle ear space. Conductive hearing loss can occur with ossicular injury, typically due to separation of the incudal stapedial joint <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incus dislocation. Otic capsule violating fractures are more frequently associated with sensorineural hearing loss, facial nerve injury, or cerebrospinal fluid leak. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sensorineural'</a> below.)</p><p>Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma and proliferative disorders, including Langerhans cell histiocytosis, can cause conductive hearing loss. However, these entities are relatively rare when compared with nonmalignant cholesteatoma or otosclerosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cholesteatoma</strong> &ndash; Cholesteatoma is a benign growth of stratified, squamous epithelium filled with desquamated cells and keratin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80406\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80406 \">picture 2</a>). As keratin desquamates from the epithelial lining of the sac, it gradually enlarges, with eventual erosion of the ossicular chain, mastoid air cells, and EAC. Formation of a cholesteatoma typically occurs after a retraction pocket has formed in the <span class=\"nowrap\">posterior/superior</span> quadrant, usually the result of poor eustachian tube function. It may also occur after tympanic membrane trauma, such as a traumatic, inflammatory, or iatrogenic perforation. A small percentage of cholesteatomas are congenital and occur most commonly in the anterior superior portion of the middle ear space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Otosclerosis</strong> &ndash; Otosclerosis is an abnormality of bone remodeling that produces overgrowth of sclerotic, hypervascular bone. It has a predilection for the footplate of the stapes. As the overgrowth develops, stapes motion is impaired and ossicular vibrations are not effectively transmitted to the inner ear fluid. Conduction gradually becomes worse until a maximal conductive hearing loss of 60 dB is reached. The long-term prognosis (several decades) includes the development of a significant sensorineural component to the hearing loss in the majority of persons with otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is uncommon in children and very rarely recognized in the first decade of life.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SENSORINEURAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders of the inner ear cause sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).

It may be hereditary or nonhereditary. Nonhereditary etiologies involve an insult to the developing cochlea, such as intrauterine infection, medications, or toxins that have a teratogenic effect on the developing ear of the fetus (eg, alcohol, methyl mercury, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">quinine</a>, trimethadione, retinoic acid, and maternal thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital infection caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, rubella, or syphilis is associated with SNHL.

The hearing loss can be delayed and progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The hearing loss may be prevented by treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pyrimethamine</a> and sulfonamide preparations if the infection is diagnosed prenatally or shortly after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The higher frequencies are affected first; normal conversational tones are affected later. SNHL in this setting is the result of inflammation from untreated disease and can be prevented by appropriate therapy before three months of age.

High-resolution computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can identify subtle variations in anatomy that my lead to variable degrees of hearing loss. Children with hereditary (genetic) SNHL have a high incidence of minor malformations of the semicircular canals, cochlea, and internal auditory canal. Inner ear malformation are discussed in greater detail separately.

Central auditory processing occurs after the sensory reception of auditory signals. Auditory dyssynchrony may reflect damage to the inner hair cells of the cochlea or to the auditory nerve or brainstem. Auditory brainstem response testing may show a prominent cochlear microphonic (electrical potential) but absent or severely distorted auditory brainstem responses. Otoacoustic emissions, produced by the outer hair cells, are frequently preserved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of speech and language disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Central auditory processing disorder'</a>.)</p><p>The CAPD diagnosis is suspected when a parent, caregiver, or teacher expresses concern regarding hearing, language, speech, or child development. Risk factors for either peripheral or central auditory dysfunction include in utero infection, prematurity, bacterial infection, hyperbilirubinemia, asphyxia, head trauma, and other neurologic insults during infancy. It may also occur secondary to structural abnormalities of the inner ear or to genetic causes, including mutations in the otoferlin gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. CAPD should be considered in patients with auditory perceptual problems that are not explained by regular audiologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hearing-loss-in-children-etiology/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Specialized psychoacoustic testing is often needed to make a definitive diagnosis of a CAPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3545487\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant hearing loss is uncommon in newborns and young children. However, nearly all children develop transient hearing loss related to ear infections during early childhood. Hearing loss in the first years of life can cause delays in speech, language, and cognitive development. Knowledge of the etiology of the hearing loss, particularly if genetic, can affect family planning and assist in the development of the optimal habilitation plan for the child. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ear is divided into three segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57082\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57082 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and physiology'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The outer ear, comprising the auricle and ear canal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The middle ear, comprising the tympanic membrane, ossicles, and the middle ear space</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The inner ear, comprising the cochlea, semicircular canals, and internal auditory canals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss may be classified as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conductive, involving any cause that in some way limits the amount of external sound that gains access to the inner ear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sensorineural, involving the inner ear, cochlea, or the auditory nerve</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mixed, which is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central (involving higher brain centers) and auditory dyssynchrony</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conductive losses imply a problem in the outer or middle ear: the pinna, external canal, tympanic membrane, or ossicles. Congenital anomalies, infections, and trauma to the outer ear can cause conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss associated with the middle ear may be caused by congenital anomalies, infection, tympanic membrane perforation, or tumors. Examples of causes of conductive hearing loss include cerumen impaction, middle ear fluid, and ossicular chain fixation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Conductive'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders of the inner ear cause SNHL. Problems may occur at the level of the cochlea, eighth nerve, internal auditory canal, or brain. Congenital hearing loss is any hearing loss that occurs at or shortly after birth. It may be hereditary or nonhereditary. Nonhereditary etiologies involve an insult to the developing cochlea, such as intrauterine infection, medications, or toxins that have a teratogenic effect on the developing ear of the fetus. Hereditary causes account for up to 50 percent of cases of SNHL and include SNHL with (one-third) and without (two-thirds) associated abnormalities (syndromic and nonsyndromic, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66758 \">table 3</a>). The hearing deficit in hereditary hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital), progressive from birth, or it may develop when the child is older. Causes of acquired SNHL include prematurity, infection, hyperbilirubinemia, ototoxins, noise, trauma, and tumors. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Sensorineural'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central auditory processing disorder is described as a deficit in the perception or complete analysis of auditory information that is associated with dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system, most commonly the cerebral cortex. It occurs after the sensory reception of auditory signals but prior to language processing or comprehension.
