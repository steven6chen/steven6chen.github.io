However, the dose selected is excessive for a patient with renal insufficiency. Typical side effects of metoclopramide include drowsiness, restlessness, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, and Parkinson syndrome.</p><p>In patients with normal renal function, one would ordinarily use a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> dose of 10 mg by mouth four times a day (before meals and at bedtime). The patient under consideration has renal insufficiency. His estimated glomerular filtration rate based on his serum creatinine level, height, and weight is 28.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>. At an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute,</span> 50 percent of the usual metoclopramide dose should be used.</p><p>Return to the previous choice to try again.
