The pathogenesis of hyponatremia in these patients is directly related to the hemodynamic changes and secondary neurohumoral adaptations that occur, resulting in an impaired ability to excrete ingested water. The severity of the hyponatremia is related to the severity of the cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Water retention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors can contribute to the development of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis. The most important factor is systemic vasodilation, which leads to activation of endogenous vasoconstrictors including antidiuretic hormone (ADH); ADH promotes the water retention that is responsible for the fall in serum sodium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic vasodilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic vasodilation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. These patients usually have a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and in mean arterial pressure and an increase in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The vascular territory in which the reduced SVR is most obvious is the splanchnic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The presence of vasodilation in other vascular territories is less obvious and the subject of controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, the factors that cause splanchnic vasodilatation may have a biphasic effect on the renal circulation. Early in the course of the disease &ndash; stable cirrhosis without ascites &ndash; the dilating substances also may influence the renal vasculature and the glomerular filtration rate may be greater than normal (150 versus 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in one study) at this stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With more severe disease, the splanchnic vasodilatation becomes more marked, resulting in a fall in mean arterial pressure and decreased renal perfusion, leading in some patients to the hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The precise mechanisms of vasodilation in cirrhosis have become better understood, with increased generation of nitric oxide and prostaglandins appearing to play an important role (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81659\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81659 \">algorithm 1</a>). Nitric oxide production may be stimulated by absorbed endotoxin from the gastrointestinal tract, which is less efficiently cleared due to portal-systemic shunting and decreased reticuloendothelial cell function in cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Activation of endogenous vasoconstrictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reduction in pressure (or stretch) at the carotid and renal baroreceptors induced by cirrhotic vasodilation leads to activation of the sodium- and water-retaining neurohumoral mechanisms in an attempt to restore perfusion pressure to normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81659\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81659 \">algorithm 1</a>). These include the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). The secretion of these three &quot;hypovolemic&quot; hormones is proportional to the severity of the hemodynamic insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74244 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>The net effect is avid renal sodium and water retention because the patient is effectively volume depleted even though extracellular sodium stores, the plasma volume, and the cardiac output are increased. Sodium retention leads to the development of ascites unless the patient is adequately treated with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Water retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water excretion is usually normal in patients with cirrhosis before the development of ascites and then becomes increasingly impaired as the liver disease progresses. This abnormality is largely related to the increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] since suppression of ADH release is required to excrete a water load. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenetic importance of ADH in water retention has been demonstrated in rats with cirrhosis in which the administration of a vasopressin (ADH) receptor antagonist restores near normal water excretory ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although of lesser importance, the renal vasoconstriction and reduction in renal blood flow induced by neurohumoral activation also may contribute to diminished water excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The inability to excrete water normally leads to the development of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, patients who have cirrhosis with ascites typically demonstrate urinary sodium retention, increased total body sodium, increased total body water, and hypotonic hyponatremia.</p><p>Because the increase in ADH secretion (and therefore the degree of water retention) is roughly proportional to the severity of the cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74244 \">figure 1</a>), the degree of hyponatremia parallels the severity of the hepatic disease and is, along with the degree of sodium retention, of prognostic value. A serum sodium concentration below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> carries a relatively poor prognosis, whereas values below 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> often indicate impending hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Two factors other than high ADH levels may contribute to the tendency toward hyponatremia in selected patients with cirrhosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretic therapy can exacerbate the reduction in tissue perfusion, further impairing the ability to excrete free water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This is most likely to occur with rapid fluid removal in patients with ascites but no peripheral edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large-volume beer drinkers ingest a large volume of fluid, thereby increasing the tendency to hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia is common in patients with cirrhosis. In an international prospective study involving 997 patients in 28 Liver Units, the prevalence of a serum sodium concentration less than 135, 130, 125, and 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in patients with cirrhosis and ascites was 50, 22, 6, and 1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The prevalence was high in both inpatients and outpatients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTOR OF ADVERSE PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In keeping with the correlation between hyponatremia and systemic hemodynamics in cirrhosis, the presence of hyponatremia is associated in a graded fashion with severe ascites (high prevalence of refractory ascites, large fluid accumulation rate, frequent use of large-volume paracentesis), impaired renal function, and higher rates of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>Hyponatremia is also a powerful predictor of death in patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are on the wait list for a liver transplant. In three studies, for example, serum sodium concentrations of less than 135, 126, or 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> were independent risk factors for death in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>The current system for prioritizing patients for liver transplantation uses the serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and international normalized ratio (INR) for the prothrombin time to calculate the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Adding hyponatremia to the MELD score is a better predictor of death than the MELD score alone, particularly in patients with low MELD scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The magnitude of the effect of serum sodium on prognosis in patients with end-stage liver disease was evaluated in a report of the 6769 candidates for primary liver transplantation who were registered in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network in the United States in 2005 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The hazard rate for death was 1.05 per 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> decrease in serum sodium at values between 140 and 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. In addition to being a risk factor for death, low serum sodium concentrations (particularly below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> are associated with an increased risk of the osmotic demyelination syndrome with severe neurologic dysfunction shortly after liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hypertonic saline, osmotic demyelination, and liver transplantation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis typically develops slowly (paralleling the rate of progression of the liver disease) and usually produces no obvious clinical manifestations until the serum sodium concentration falls below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> which occurred in only 1 percent of patients with cirrhosis in a multicenter series of 997 consecutive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Because of the lack of clear benefit to the patient, the potential side effects and costs of therapy, and the dismal prognosis of patients with cirrhosis who have severe hyponatremia and are not candidates for a liver transplant, some experts do <strong>not</strong> recommend efforts to raise the serum sodium in this setting. </p><p>If treatment of the hyponatremia is desired in patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation or for whom liver transplantation is not imminent, the main indications are neurologic symptoms that might be due to hyponatremia or a serum sodium less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> which occurs in about 1 percent of patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For patients in whom liver transplantation is imminent, treatment can be initiated when the serum sodium is less than 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hypertonic saline, osmotic demyelination, and liver transplantation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54245858\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Raising the serum sodium is often difficult in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Patients with symptoms that may be attributable to hyponatremia are often initially treated with hypertonic saline. However, fluid restriction is the primary option to achieve a sustained increase in the serum sodium. If present, hypokalemia should be corrected since this will also tend to raise the serum sodium.</p><p>Vasopressin receptor antagonists can also raise the serum sodium in patients with hyponatremia due to cirrhosis. However, because of potential hepatotoxicity, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolvaptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolvaptan</a> (an oral vasopressin receptor antagonist) should <strong>not</strong> be given to patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, sodium chloride tablets should not generally be used, as they can worsen hypervolemia. (See <a href=\"#H9310217\" class=\"local\">'Do not use tolvaptan in patients with cirrhosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When patients with advanced cirrhosis and hyponatremia are treated, overly rapid correction of hyponatremia should be avoided because of the possible induction of severe neurologic injury, called the osmotic demyelination syndrome. The goal rate of correction of the serum sodium is 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day, and the rise in serum sodium should be less than 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> during any 24-hour period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fluid restriction is frequently employed in patients with cirrhosis and ascites because of concerns related to hyponatremia, such an approach is not supported by the available data.</p><p>Proper patient selection for fluid restriction is important since, in our experience, fluid restriction tends to alienate the patient, family, nurses, and dietitians without proven benefit. One of the important limitations to compliance with fluid restriction is that the systemic vasodilation that stimulates ADH release (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74244 \">figure 1</a>) also enhances thirst. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Activation of endogenous vasoconstrictors'</a> above.)</p><p>There is much confusion about the degree of fluid restriction. Some clinicians order 1000 mL or 1500 mL free water restriction per day. Some nurses and dietitians include all fluids and others include only fluids on the tray. However, for fluid restriction to raise the serum sodium, the total fluid intake should be less than the urine volume, which is usually quite low; as a result, fluid restriction is often difficult to achieve in patients with cirrhosis who have hyponatremia. Sucking on ice chips or lollipops may be helpful in patients with severe thirst. </p><p>We attempt to limit fluid intake when the serum sodium is less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> which only occurs in about 1 percent of patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Fluid restriction may also be warranted at somewhat higher serum sodium concentrations (120 to 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> in patients who have impaired mentation that might be due to hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or in patients awaiting liver transplantation. If the serum sodium concentration does not increase within the first 48 to 72 hours, the degree of fluid restriction has been insufficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Correction of hypokalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemia in patients with cirrhosis can result from increased urinary losses due to diuretic therapy or increased gastrointestinal losses in patients with diarrhea or vomiting. Hypokalemia, which may be accompanied by metabolic alkalosis, can promote the development of hepatic encephalopathy, by at least two mechanisms: hypokalemia increases renal ammonia synthesis, which delivers additional ammonia into the systemic circulation; alkalemia increases the fraction of unionized ammonia in the plasma. Unionized ammonia more readily penetrates cells, including brain cells, which can worsen hepatic encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Correct hypokalemia'</a>.) </p><p>In addition, since potassium is as osmotically active as sodium, the administration of potassium will also tend to raise the serum sodium concentration. The mechanism by which this occurs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasopressin receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple receptors for vasopressin (ADH): the V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors. The V2 receptors primarily mediate the antidiuretic response, while V1a and V1b receptors principally cause vasoconstriction and mediate adrenocorticotropin release, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>The vasopressin receptor antagonists produce a selective water diuresis without affecting sodium and potassium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Only tolvaptan and conivaptan are currently available in the United States.</p><p>There is concern that V1a receptor blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conivaptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">conivaptan</a> may result in both a reduction in blood pressure, which is already low in most such patients, and an increase in the risk of variceal bleeding, given the efficacy of vasopressin in the treatment of active variceal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A V1a antagonist might also compromise renal function since treatment with the V1a agonist, terlipressin, improves renal function in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia&quot;, section on 'Overly rapid rate of correction'</a>.) </p><p>Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia can also occur after liver transplantation and is associated with neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In different studies, the rate of ODS after liver transplantation ranged from 5 to 29 percent in patients with hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. The median time to onset of ODS in reported cases is 5 to 7 days; late development beyond 12 days is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 2175 liver transplant recipients, 10 (0.5 percent) developed ODS after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The mean baseline serum sodium concentration was 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in the patients who developed ODS, significantly lower than the mean value of 136 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in those who did not. The likelihood of developing ODS increased with lower baseline serum sodium concentrations: 0.1, 0.8, and 4.6 percent at serum sodium concentrations of 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or higher, 125 to 134 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> and less than 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> respectively. Data were not available on the use of hypertonic saline or on the rate of correction of the serum sodium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another large retrospective study evaluated 379 liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among 12 patients with a serum sodium less than or equal to 127 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> ODS developed in 3 (25 percent). The rise in serum sodium during transplantation in these patients was 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> compared with only 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in those who did not develop ODS. A third study found a similar rate of ODS following liver transplantation (29 percent [4 of 14 patients]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The serum sodium concentration prior to surgery in these four patients was markedly reduced in two. The perioperative rise in serum sodium was 21 to 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> with the maximum increase on the day of surgery.</p><p/><p>Thus, ODS after liver transplantation primarily occurs in patients who have a baseline serum sodium concentration below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and a rapid elevation in the serum sodium in the peritransplant period. In the last study, none of the four patients who developed ODS was treated with hypertonic saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This observation suggests that restoration of hepatic function alone <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> the large volumes of isotonic fluid administered intraoperatively) is sufficient to induce rapid correction of hyponatremia, and provides support for partial, slow correction of hyponatremia <strong>prior</strong> to transplantation in patients with serum sodium concentrations of 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less. However, this approach will not protect all patients, since pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis can occur in patients who are not hyponatremic prior to liver transplantation and do not have a rapid elevation in serum sodium after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important factor in the development of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis is systemic vasodilation, which leads to activation of endogenous vasoconstrictors including antidiuretic hormone (ADH); ADH promotes the water retention that is responsible for the fall in serum sodium. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia is a powerful predictor of death in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and adding hyponatremia to the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a better predictor of death than the MELD score alone. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Predictor of adverse prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the lack of clear benefit to the patient, the potential side effects and costs of therapy, and the overall dismal prognosis of patient with cirrhosis with severe hyponatremia, some experts do <strong>not</strong> recommend efforts to raise the serum sodium. (See <a href=\"#H1352239\" class=\"local\">'Decision to treat'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If treatment of the hyponatremia is desired in patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation or for whom liver transplantation is not imminent, the main indications are neurologic symptoms that might be due to hyponatremia or a serum sodium less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1352239\" class=\"local\">'Decision to treat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising the serum sodium is often difficult in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The major option to achieve a sustained increase in the serum sodium is fluid restriction. Vasopressin receptor antagonists can raise the serum sodium in such patients, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolvaptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolvaptan</a> should <strong>not</strong> be used in patients with cirrhosis, because of its known potential for hepatotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H54245858\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic modalities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9310217\" class=\"local\">'Do not use tolvaptan in patients with cirrhosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid restriction is difficult to achieve in patients with cirrhosis and hyponatremia for two reasons: these patients often complain of thirst; and, for fluid restriction to raise the serum sodium, the total fluid intake should be less than the urine volume, which is typically quite low. Sucking on ice chips or lollipops may be helpful in patients with severe thirst. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Fluid restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with cirrhosis who are treated for hyponatremia, we recommend a goal rate of correction of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> per day, and the rate should be less than 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in any 24-hour period. The rationale for this recommendation is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a serum sodium concentration less than 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in whom liver transplantation is imminent, we recommend administration of hypertonic saline prior to transplantation to partially correct the hyponatremia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Liver transplantation quickly restores hepatic function which, along with large volumes of isotonic fluids given during surgery, may result in rapid correction of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis. Low pretransplant serum sodium concentrations (particularly below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> are associated with an increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome with severe neurologic dysfunction shortly after transplantation. Preoperative use of hypertonic saline may minimize the risk of overly rapid correction after transplantation and, in a monitored setting, has low potential for harm.
