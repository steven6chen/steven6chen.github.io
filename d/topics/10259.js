Its use is limited by a high incidence of side effects, a requirement for close clinical and laboratory monitoring, and the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a> (GST), the more efficacious form of gold, to be administered by periodic intramuscular injection.</p><p>Gold is used in a highly selected patient population, given the many treatment options for RA. Patients are typically referred for gold therapy because of one of the following: concerns regarding immunosuppression, coexisting chronic infection, contraindications to other therapies or the failure of such therapies, unavailability of other medications due to excessive cost for the patient or health care system, and pregnancy planning in selected women in whom treatment options may be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The major side effects of gold therapy and their management will be reviewed here. The use of gold compounds for the treatment of rheumatic disease and the pulmonary adverse effects of gold therapy are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of gold compounds in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Gold'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF GOLD TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects occur in approximately 30 percent of patients treated with parenteral gold compounds, and are the most common reason for discontinuing gold therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61137 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The following major points should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common side effects are pruritus, dermatitis, stomatitis, and proteinuria (see <a href=\"#H20014278\" class=\"local\">'Mucocutaneous effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20014738\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria and membranous glomerulonephritis'</a> below). These toxicities typically present within the first six months of therapy, and occur more frequently in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a> (GST), the parenterally administered preparation, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auranofin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">auranofin</a>, which is taken orally. Loose, soft stools are a common side effect of auranofin, and watery diarrhea may occur in up to 5 percent of patients on this drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of HLA-DR3 is associated with an increased risk of nephropathy and of immune thrombocytopenia related to gold therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postinjection reactions may occur, including vasomotor reactions to GST injection, which occur in about 5 to 7 percent of patients and may be seen at any time over the course of treatment. Rarely, patients may experience postinjection arthralgia or worsening of arthritis during the first few weeks of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7562590\" class=\"local\">'Postinjection vasomotor/nitritoid reactions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2475701\" class=\"local\">'Other side effects'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with symptoms or findings that may represent adverse effects of gold therapy, we discontinue gold, at least temporarily. We take this approach even in the presence of common side effects that may also have other causes, such as pruritus and mouth sores. In patients with minor side effects that are unlikely to become serious and in whom no other cause has been identified, gold can be cautiously reintroduced at a 50 percent lower dose once side effects have resolved, while monitoring closely. Most gold side effects resolve slowly over weeks or months after gold has been discontinued. If the side effect does not resolve, causality should be reassessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More severe toxicities that may require permanent discontinuation to help avoid severe morbidity or mortality include persistent and significant proteinuria; hematologic and pulmonary toxicity; and hepatitis, enterocolitis, and neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H20014738\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria and membranous glomerulonephritis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic toxicity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial pneumonitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2475520\" class=\"local\">'Diarrhea and enterocolitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2475701\" class=\"local\">'Other side effects'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7562590\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTINJECTION VASOMOTOR/NITRITOID REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasomotor reactions, commonly termed &ldquo;nitritoid reactions,&rdquo; are unpredictable and potentially serious reactions that occur in 5 to 7 percent of patients receiving injectable gold (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a> [GST]). These reactions typically occur within seconds to minutes after the injection; symptoms include nausea, flushing, hypotension, sweating, weakness, and, infrequently, loss of consciousness due to hypotension and vasodilatation. Rarely, consequences of hypotension include myocardial infarction and stroke. However, most reactions are mild and self-limited, resolving within minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Nitritoid reactions can occur at any time during the treatment course, unlike other side effects to gold therapy that are normally seen within the first year of treatment, and they have been described with onset after up to 20 years of gold therapy. The reactions are thought to be related to the action of accumulated bradykinin, a metabolite of GST.</p><p>Nitritoid reactions are more severe and more frequent in patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. This is thought to occur because ACE inhibitors interfere with the breakdown of bradykinin, increasing the risk and severity of the reaction. Thus, we do not administer parenteral gold therapy in patients being treated with ACE inhibitors. Some experts suggest that in patients who require ACE inhibitors, gold may be cautiously employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Such patients with high risk of nitritoid reactions should be given a reduced dose (25 mg or less), receive the injection while lying down, and be observed for 10 minutes following the injection.</p><p>Management of nitritoid reactions includes positioning the patient in a supine position with the legs elevated, as the reaction results in hypotension due to vasodilatation. The blood pressure should be monitored until it normalizes. Reactions are much less common at lower doses (eg, 25 mg); patients who have experienced a nitritoid reaction should be questioned regarding new prescription of an ACE inhibitor. If this is found to be the case, gold should be withheld until appropriate substitution for the ACE inhibitor is made. Patients who have had a nitritoid reaction should subsequently be given a 50 percent reduced dose, receive injections while lying down, and be observed for 10 minutes after the weekly injection. This protocol should be followed for each injection until reactions no longer occur. Thereafter, a normal protocol for injections may be followed.</p><p>Although anaphylaxis has been reported to occur rarely with gold, true nitritoid reactions are not allergic; thus, neither glucocorticoid nor antihistamine administration is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20013658\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20014278\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucocutaneous effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermatitis and stomatitis account for most adverse gold reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Gold therapy should be withheld in patients with pruritus, dermatitis, or stomatitis until symptoms and findings resolve, and can then usually be cautiously resumed at a lower dose. A less common long-term and permanent skin change that may occur is chrysiasis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pruritus and dermatitis</strong> &ndash; Cutaneous eruptions from gold therapy are highly variable in description and in location, but almost all gold dermatitis is pruritic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The development of pruritus commonly precedes the cutaneous eruption. Vaginal pruritus, which the patient may be reluctant to report, can be the first sign of gold toxicity. Infrequently, gold may cause a lichenoid drug eruption. Pruritus and dermatitis due to gold are sometimes associated with eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;, section on 'Gold'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichenoid-drug-eruption-drug-induced-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichenoid drug eruption (drug-induced lichen planus)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gold should be withheld at the first indication of pruritus or a pruritic rash anywhere in the body, regardless of severity. The rash normally resolves spontaneously over time as long as gold injections are withheld, but often worsens if gold treatment is not interrupted. Once the rash has completely cleared, resumption of therapy may be tolerated without recurrence by cautiously reintroducing the medication at a 50 percent lower dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Symptomatic therapy for gold dermatitis includes topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, although systemic glucocorticoids may be required for severe dermatitis. The management of drug exanthems, including gold dermatitis, is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eruptions#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug eruptions&quot;, section on 'Gold'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption#H14870405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with severe gold dermatitis who require gold therapy, the risk of recurrent dermatitis can be minimized by the resumption of gold at a very low dose (2 mg per week for four weeks), with very gradual increases in the dose (1 to 5 mg incremental increase at every fourth injection) to a level that is therapeutic without any rash or pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stomatitis</strong> &ndash; Oral ulcers resembling aphthous stomatitis can occur in about 20 percent of patients receiving injectable gold, and are usually painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Gold therapy should be discontinued until these lesions resolve, then resumed at a 50 percent lower dose. Topical corticosteroid gel can be used for the treatment of stomatitis. Treatment of oral ulcers is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis#H1041165521\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent aphthous stomatitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chrysiasis</strong> &ndash; Chrysiasis is an irreversible blue-grey skin discoloration in primarily sun-exposed skin, which results from accumulation of gold in melanosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Chrysiasis is typically seen after more than five years of treatment and after a cumulative dose of about 8 grams. Laser-induced chrysiasis has been described in gold-treated subjects who are treated with high-frequency Q-switched laser in cosmetic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The gold in the skin reacts chemically to cause deep and disfiguring hyperpigmented lesions which are permanent. Infrequently chrysiasis may affect the cornea or the lens of the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is a benign, asymptomatic condition and is not an indication to modify or discontinue gold therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should be counseled regarding this potential side effect and should be advised to use sun protection, which may help to prevent these changes, but there is no treatment available for changes once they are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of sunscreen and sun-protective measures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20014738\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteinuria and membranous glomerulonephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proteinuria is common in patients receiving injectable gold, although estimates of the frequency vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Clinically significant proteinuria (greater than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours) occurs in about 2 to 7 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a> (GST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Gold-induced proteinuria is an indication to discontinue gold temporarily. Proteinuria is infrequent in patients treated with oral gold. Renal pathology demonstrates membranous glomerulonephritis, which may result in nephrotic syndrome in patients continued on gold therapy despite the presence of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In patients with 1+ proteinuria by dipstick we repeat the dipstick; if the proteinuria is confirmed at this level or greater, we discontinue gold therapy temporarily and obtain a 24-hour urine collection for protein and creatinine. In patients with greater than 250 mg of protein per 24 hours, we hold gold therapy while repeating the 24-hour urine studies every six weeks. Typically, there is a reduction in the quantity of proteinuria by 12 to 16 weeks. In patients who experience an increase in proteinuria at or after six weeks, patients with a deterioration of renal function measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or creatinine at any time, or patients who show no improvement with every six-week testing over a four-month period, evaluation by a nephrologist is indicated for assistance in management and for evaluation for alternative causes of renal impairment, which are much more likely in patients who do not improve as expected.</p><p>Typically gold-induced proteinuria resolves within about four to six months with drug discontinuation, but it can persist for as long as two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Once proteinuria has resolved following drug discontinuation, gold can safely be reinstituted at a 50 percent lower dose while monitoring closely with testing prior to each injection. If proteinuria does not resolve, other causes of kidney disease should be considered.</p><p>Hematuria is generally not a result of gold therapy, and alternative explanations for hematuria should be sought in patients being treated with gold who develop this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three uncommon to rare major hematologic side effects of gold therapy: immune thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and aplastic anemia. The development of these findings (platelet count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> total white blood cell count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">4000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> or granulocytes less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> requires at least temporary discontinuation of gold therapy, particularly in patients with a progressive or abrupt decrease in cell counts or a fall in all cell lines. Gold should generally be permanently discontinued if it is found to be the likely cause upon further evaluation. Patients with granulocytopenia that is mild and develops only with chronic administration of gold usually do not require discontinuation of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2477034\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia occurs in 1 to 3 percent of patients treated with gold, typically during the first year of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Gold should be discontinued as soon as thrombocytopenia is detected. In gold-induced thrombocytopenia, the platelet count normally continues to fall, even after discontinuing gold. The development of immune thrombocytopenia has been described as long as 18 months after gold therapy has been discontinued. Thus, gold should be immediately and permanently discontinued if thrombocytopenia due to gold develops and treatment should be instituted. In patients treated with gold, thrombocytopenia is usually antibody-mediated but rarely may occur due to bone marrow suppression. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment are similar to other drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias, which are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia#H2126658195\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Platelet count recovery/monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2477041\"><span class=\"h3\">Neutropenia and aplastic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gold may rarely cause neutropenia or bone marrow suppression with aplastic anemia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutropenia</strong> &ndash; Granulocytopenia associated with gold therapy may present as isolated finding or with neutropenia associated with aplastic anemia, but can also occur due to the presence of Felty&rsquo;s syndrome as a complication of the rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with granulocytopenia that develops early or suddenly during therapy should discontinue gold and be closely monitored for further worsening, but patients with very gradual development of mildly reduced granulocyte counts over many years of therapy may tolerate continued drug administration. Patients with Felty&rsquo;s syndrome in whom reductions in granulocyte counts do not appear temporally related to gold administration do not usually need to discontinue gold therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one series of neutropenic patients, the finding in 14 of 25 neutropenic patients receiving gold for RA was associated with a gradual and benign reduction in neutrophils in patients who had been on gold for years; most of these patients were able to continue gold therapy without adverse consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In contrast, granulocytopenia that occurred in 8 of the 25 patients early in gold therapy (after administration of no more than 1 gram of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a>) was thought to be due to myelotoxicity and associated with a risk for other cytopenias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aplastic anemia</strong> &ndash; Aplastic anemia occurs in less than 0.1 to 0.5 percent of gold-treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Management is the same as other drug-induced aplastic anemias. Treatment choices depend upon the severity of the aplastic anemia and the patient&rsquo;s age and comorbidities. Treatment includes withdrawal of gold therapy and may include supportive care, such as transfusions and antibiotics. Patients with severe aplastic anemia require a form of more definitive therapy, such as hematopoietic cell transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy (eg, antithymocyte globulin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>). The management of aplastic anemia is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aplastic anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Interstitial pneumonitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare complication of gold, but is the most common presentation of gold toxicity in the lungs. It typically presents within the first six months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Rapid improvement usually follows withdrawal of gold and the administration of systemic glucocorticoid therapy. The clinical manifestations and management of gold-induced pulmonary disease and the pulmonary complications of RA are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, profuse diarrhea, and fever. In patients who develop these symptoms after newly starting gold therapy, the drug should be discontinued immediately and further evaluation is required. This complication has been estimated to have a mortality rate approaching 50 percent, but this estimate is based upon a very small number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Treatment typically includes high-dose glucocorticoids.</p><p>Diarrhea is a very uncommon side effect of parenteral gold therapy, in contrast with the occurrence of loose, soft stools in up to 40 percent of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auranofin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">auranofin</a>, typically in the first month of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Watery diarrhea may occur in up to 5 percent of auranofin-treated patients and requires discontinuation of the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2475701\"><span class=\"h2\">Other side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other side effects of gold therapy include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F61137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61137 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metallic taste</strong> &ndash; Development of a metallic taste is a common symptom that usually occurs early in the course of parenteral gold therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Metallic taste usually diminishes over time with ongoing therapy. Short-term dose reduction may be helpful if this side effect is bothersome to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polyarthralgia</strong> &ndash; Postinjection flares of joint pain or worsening of arthritis occur rarely early in the treatment course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These flares typically resolve within the first month of gold therapy, but some patients benefit from a temporary reduction in dose. Discontinuation of therapy is generally not required. The temporal relationship of the flare to gold injection helps to distinguish it from a random disease flare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatotoxicity </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Cholestatic jaundice occurs rarely, typically early in the gold treatment course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Symptoms are nausea, weakness, and jaundice. In patients reporting these symptoms, particularly if they develop soon after starting gold or within the first six months, gold should be withheld, and measurement of liver enzymes, albumin, and bilirubin should be performed. We do not normally monitor liver enzymes in patients who are not concomitantly on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) known to be commonly hepatotoxic. The reason for this is that gold-induced liver disease is a clinically symptomatic condition. Monitoring for liver enzyme elevation is not indicated or cost-effective. In one study, abnormal liver chemistries without jaundice were seen in 4 percent (3 of 75) of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a>. Gold should be discontinued immediately in patients suspected to have gold-induced hepatotoxicity, whether or not jaundice is present. There are a small number of reported cases. In virtually all cases, cholestatic hepatitis resolves following drug discontinuation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic complications</strong> &ndash; Neurologic complications of gold therapy are rare and serious. Peripheral neuropathy, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, cranial nerve palsies, and encephalitis have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Neurologic toxicity typically occurs within the first three months of gold therapy and is reversible after discontinuing treatment. Myokymia, an irregular twitching of muscles, is one characteristic clinical sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20013631\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING FOR TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients treated with gold should be thoroughly informed about the common and potentially serious side effects of gold therapy. Our approach to monitoring for adverse events is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases#H8924089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of gold compounds in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Monitoring parenteral gold'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases#H11153948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of gold compounds in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Monitoring oral gold'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2476124\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF GOLD TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most adverse events that might be related to gold therapy require at least temporary drug discontinuation while being evaluated. The management approach to each side effect is described separately in the section on that symptom or finding (see appropriate sections in this topic).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2477367\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gold appears safe in women planning pregnancy, and it has not been associated with an increase in adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, documented experience is limited to small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Neither prior gold therapy nor ongoing treatment has been proven harmful to the fetus. The use of gold during pregnancy is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases#H11153734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of gold compounds in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy and lactation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86792129\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse reactions develop in one-third of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a> (GST), the form of gold therapy administered by intramuscular injection. The most common side effects are pruritus, dermatitis, stomatitis, proteinuria, and nitritoid reactions. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which may increase the risk of nitritoid reactions, should not be used in patients taking GST. Mucocutaneous side effects and proteinuria are less common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auranofin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">auranofin</a>, the oral gold compound, with which the most common side effects are loose, soft stools or diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of gold toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7562590\" class=\"local\">'Postinjection vasomotor/nitritoid reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20014278\" class=\"local\">'Mucocutaneous effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatitis and stomatitis account for most adverse gold reactions. Gold therapy should be held in patients with pruritus, dermatitis, or stomatitis until symptoms and findings resolve, and can then usually be cautiously resumed. Chrysiasis is a less common long-term and permanent skin change that may occur. (See <a href=\"#H20014278\" class=\"local\">'Mucocutaneous effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteinuria greater than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours occurs in 2 to 7 percent of patients treated with GST, but is infrequent in patients using oral gold. Renal pathology demonstrates membranous glomerulonephritis, which may result in nephrotic syndrome in patients continued on gold therapy despite the presence of proteinuria. Gold-induced proteinuria is an indication to discontinue gold temporarily, but once proteinuria has resolved following drug discontinuation, gold can cautiously be reinstituted at a lower dose. (See <a href=\"#H20014738\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria and membranous glomerulonephritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three uncommon to rare major hematologic side effects of gold therapy: immune thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and aplastic anemia. The development of these findings (platelet count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> total white blood cell count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">4000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> or granulocytes less than <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> requires discontinuation of gold therapy and may require additional medical intervention. Patients with granulocytopenia that is mild and develops only with chronic administration of gold usually do not require discontinuation of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2477034\" class=\"local\">'Thrombocytopenia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2477041\" class=\"local\">'Neutropenia and aplastic anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further side effects of gold include a metallic taste and, infrequently, postinjection flares of arthralgia. Additional rare complications of gold therapy include interstitial pneumonitis, enterocolitis, hepatotoxicity, and neurologic complications. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Interstitial pneumonitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2475520\" class=\"local\">'Diarrhea and enterocolitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2475701\" class=\"local\">'Other side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baseline complete blood count and differential, platelet count, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and urinalysis should be obtained. Subsequently, a complete blood count and urinalysis should be performed weekly for the first four weeks of treatment and at least every two weeks prior to injection for the first six months of therapy. Subsequent testing may be performed at less frequent intervals. Patients should be queried regarding side effects, such as pruritus or new rashes, before injections. (See <a href=\"#H20013631\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gold appears safe in women planning pregnancy. While gold is usually discontinued in pregnancy by most clinicians, it has not been proven to result in any adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.
