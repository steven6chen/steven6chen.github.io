In most instances, the anxiety disorder onset precedes that of the SUD(s). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and SUDs have not been found to be strongly associated. (See <a href=\"#H20550104\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preclinical studies demonstrate that SUDs and anxiety-related disorders share common neurobiological substrates that include disruptions within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and noradrenergic systems. (See <a href=\"#H20550111\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with co-occurring SUDs and anxiety-related disorders present with a more severe clinical profile and greater chronicity as compared to individuals with either disorder alone. (See <a href=\"#H20550132\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20550139\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical observation during a period of prolonged abstinence from substances can distinguish a transient, substance-induced state from a true anxiety disorder. The duration of abstinence necessary for accurate diagnosis varies depending on the substance. (See <a href=\"#H20550146\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substances with a long half-life (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) may require several weeks of abstinence to make an accurate diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substances with a shorter half-life (eg, alcohol and cocaine), can generally be accurately diagnosed after approximately 30 days of abstinence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tips for distinguishing anxiety-related disorders from the effects of substance intoxication or withdrawal differ by disorder:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most of the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder can be mimicked by substance use. Assessment should be delayed until symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal have resolved. (See <a href=\"#H16814853\" class=\"local\">'Generalized anxiety disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In contrast with obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviors that occur secondary to a SUD center on the substances used. (See <a href=\"#H16814860\" class=\"local\">'Obsessive-compulsive disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substances, stimulants in particular, can induce panic attacks. In contrast to panic experienced in the context of SUDs, attacks characteristic of panic disorder occur unexpectedly, and patients experience persistent worry about having another attack. (See <a href=\"#H16814871\" class=\"local\">'Panic disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperarousal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (eg, irritability, sleep impairment, difficulty concentrating, exaggerated startle response) can be exacerbated by the use of, or withdrawal from, alcohol and drugs. (See <a href=\"#H2348985\" class=\"local\">'Other anxiety disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The primary feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD), fear of public scrutiny, is not typically mimicked by substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Symptoms of SAD that present only in the context of intoxication or withdrawal are not sufficient to meet criteria for a diagnosis of SAD.
