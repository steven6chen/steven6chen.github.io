Typical symptoms include focal neurologic signs such as paresis, visual loss, speech and language impairment, gait disturbance, and cerebellar signs; seizures, headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> change in level of consciousness are not uncommon. In most cases, stroke symptoms and signs last for at least 24 hours and are associated with corresponding neuroimaging findings. Individuals with SCD are at increased risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral infarction refers to an ischemic stroke, although these can sometimes undergo hemorrhagic transformation. The term cerebrovascular accident has fallen out of favor but is still used in some publications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Silent cerebral infarction</strong> &ndash; A silent cerebral infarction (SCI), also known as a silent brain infarction, is defined as a lesion visible in at least two planes of T2-weighted MRI images and at least 3 mm in greatest linear dimension, with no associated findings on neurological exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. SCI is not truly silent because the presence of these lesions is correlated with neurocognitive and behavioral deficits. Information about these lesions is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;, section on 'Silent brain infarcts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transient ischemic attack</strong> &ndash; In the modern tissue-based definition, transient ischemic attack (TIA) refers to a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, <strong>without</strong> acute infarction. The traditional time-based definition of TIA, still widely used, is that of a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction lasting less than 24 hours and caused by reversible cerebral ischemia. With the time-based definition of TIA, there may or may not be a corresponding ischemic lesion on neuroimaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H2074998073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Definition of TIA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary prevention</strong> &ndash; Primary prevention refers to interventions to reduce the risk of a first stroke. In SCD, primary prevention is used in those deemed at increased risk of stroke based on transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements and, in some cases, the identification of SCI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary prevention</strong> &ndash; Secondary prevention refers to interventions to reduce the risk of recurrence in individuals who have already had a first stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong> &ndash; Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an umbrella term that includes all patients who have one copy of the sickle beta globin (&beta;<sup>S</sup>) allele along with a second altered beta globin allele. The second beta globin allele may also carry the sickle mutation (resulting in homozygous SCD, designated HbSS) or a different mutation such as a beta thalassemia mutation (resulting in sickle beta-thalassemia), the hemoglobin C mutation (resulting in HbSC disease), or others. Patients with SCD have hemolytic anemia and laboratory evidence of sickling and other erythrocyte abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transcranial Doppler</strong> &ndash; TCD is a noninvasive ultrasound-based method of measuring the flow rate of blood in intracranial arteries such as the internal carotid arteries and the arteries of the circle of Willis, including the middle cerebral circulation. TCD readings are thought to be a marker for stenosis, and they have become standard of care as a screening test for stroke risk in SCD. (See <a href=\"#H1176615547\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment for first stroke'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3403387342\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1689723805\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with SCD are at risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke is typically due to vascular occlusion caused by intimal proliferation rather than thromboembolic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is most often associated with occlusion or stenosis of the large intracranial arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiologic mechanisms of vasculopathy in SCD include vaso-occlusion triggered by abnormal receptor-ligand interactions between white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), platelets, and the vascular endothelium. These abnormal cellular interactions, along with aberrant endothelial regulation by nitric oxide and other signaling molecules, result in abnormal intimal proliferation and progressive stenosis, which in turn produces ischemia in the cerebral microcirculation. There may also be injury to the arterial endothelium and impaired vascular autoregulation, especially in areas of high flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some individuals may develop a moyamoya-like syndrome characterized by bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the arteries around the circle of Willis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50288\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50288 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moyamoya-disease-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moyamoya disease: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mechanisms underlying hemorrhagic stroke are less well understood; contributing factors may include rupture of weakened primary vessels or fragile collateral vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is also a possible association between SCD and the incidence of intracranial aneurysms. In a cohort of 709 pediatric and adult SCD patients who had neuroimaging performed, 19 (2.7 percent) had aneurysms. The prevalence of aneurysms was significantly higher among adult patients (10.8 percent) compared with pediatric patients (1.2 percent). Ten of the 19 patients had multiple aneurysms, with a mean of 2.3 aneurysms per patient, and the location of aneurysms was often atypical relative to patients without SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a second cohort of 251 pediatric patients, seven (2.8 percent) had evidence of aneurysms on neuroimaging, suggesting an event rate of 0.33 per 100 patient-years in patients with SCD, significantly higher than the estimated event rate in the general pediatric population of 0.0002 per 100 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It was hypothesized that common mechanisms of vascular injury may underlie both vessel stenosis and wall weakening. These studies do not establish a causal link between aneurysms and hemorrhage, but their findings are supportive of the hypothesis that aneurysms may contribute to the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in patients with SCD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H787855668\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors: Ischemic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following characteristics are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>SCD genotype</strong> &ndash; SCD genotype is a major predictor of stroke risk. Genotypes with the greatest disease severity in general (homozygous sickle mutation or sickle-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia) are associated with the greatest stroke risk. In a cohort of 4082 individuals with SCD enrolled in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) from 1978 to 1988, the risk of stroke was highest in those homozygous for sickle hemoglobin (HbSS), while individuals with hemoglobin SC disease or sickle-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia were at substantially lower risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61397 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this cohort, patients with sickle-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia also appeared to have a very low stroke risk, but this is likely an artifact of the relatively small number of patients of this genotype in the cohort. The two greatest risk factors for a first ischemic stroke were related to disease severity: prior transient ischemic attack (TIA; relative risk [RR] 56; 95% CI 12-285) and an episode of acute chest syndrome (ACS) within the previous two weeks (RR 7; 95% CI 2-27). There was a dose-response contribution from frequent episodes of ACS (RR 2.39 per event per year), lower steady state hemoglobin level (RR 1.9 per 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> decrease), and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP; RR 1.31 per every 10 mm Hg of SBP). The major risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke were lower steady state hemoglobin level (RR 1.6 per 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> decrease) and higher steady state white blood count (WBC; RR 1.9 per <span class=\"nowrap\">5000/microL</span> increase). Stroke and silent cerebral infarctions (SCI) are reported to be more common in SCD patients with a history of seizures, although cause and effect may be difficult to separate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other genetic risk factors</strong> &ndash; Numerous genetic polymorphisms have been associated with modifications of stroke risk. Alpha thalassemia trait appeared to be somewhat protective. In a series of 44 patients with SCD who had a stroke, alpha thalassemia trait was present in 9 (20 percent); a higher prevalence of alpha thalassemia trait was seen in those who did not have a stroke (38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Decreased stroke risk is associated with presence of the minor alleles of genes encoding adenylate cyclase 9 (<em>ADCY9</em>), the Golgi apparatus-associated protein (<em>GOLGB1</em>), a transmembrane glycoprotein (<em>ENPP1)</em>, and the deletion 3.7 allele of the <em>HbA2</em> locus. Genetic factors associated with increased stroke risk include minor alleles of genes that encode annexin A2 (<em>ANXA2</em>), Tek tyrosine kinase (<em>TEK</em>) and the TGF beta receptor 3 (<em>TGFBR3</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Beta-globin haplotype and the presence of the <em>G6PD A</em><em><sup>-</sup></em> allele did not appear to make any difference to stroke risk.<strong> </strong>The pathophysiologic role and clinical significance of these polymorphisms remain to be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbidities and other clinical factors </strong>&ndash; Risk factors for ischemic or embolic stroke unrelated to SCD, such as oral contraceptive use, smoking, inherited thrombophilia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other vasculopathy, may also play a role in SCD stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sleep disordered breathing and daytime oxygen desaturation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease#H55815473\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Sleep disordered breathing'</a>) have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Contributions from medical comorbidities appear to persist despite chronic transfusion therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reticulocyte count</strong> &ndash; A retrospective review of the newborn cohort in the CSSCD study indicated that reticulocytosis, defined as an absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;194,000/microL,</span> before age six months was a good predictor of future ischemic stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A subsequent prospective study of 121 children with hematologic data available from infancy indicated a significant correlation between rising ARC and dropping hemoglobin concentration and the incidence of abnormal or conditional transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities, a surrogate of stroke risk (see <a href=\"#H1176615547\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment for first stroke'</a> below). Children in the normal TCD group had a mean infancy ARC of <span class=\"nowrap\">140,000/microL</span> and a mean hemoglobin concentration of 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> children in the conditional TCD group had a mean ARC of <span class=\"nowrap\">175,000/microL</span> and mean hemoglobin concentration of 8.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> and children in the abnormal TCD group had a mean ARC of <span class=\"nowrap\">264,000/microL</span> and mean hemoglobin level of 8.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. We may be more aggressive in starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> earlier in these infants and obtaining a first TCD at 18 months rather than two years. (See <a href=\"#H2982566596\" class=\"local\">'TCD screening protocol'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Risk factors for abnormal TCD velocity measurements, a surrogate for increased stroke risk, were evaluated in a 2016 prospective study that followed 375 infants with SCD from time of diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, abnormal TCD velocities were correlated with upper or lower airway obstruction (hazard ratios [HR]: 1.47 and 1.76, respectively per year of obstruction), and elevated ARC (HR: 1.82 per rise of <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL)</span>. Elevated hemoglobin F (HbF) was protective, with a HR of 0.68 per 5 percent rise. The presence of alpha thalassemia trait and increased overall hemoglobin concentration were also associated with lower risk of abnormal TCD velocities, but these variables did not retain significance in multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370190264\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors: Hemorrhagic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke identified in the CSSCD cohort included low baseline hemoglobin concentration and elevated steady-state WBC count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, other suggested risk factors include previous ischemic stroke, aneurysms, hypertension, recent transfusion, and recent use of glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a cohort of 255 patients from the California Patient Discharge Databases with SCD who had acute stroke, there were significant associations between hemorrhagic stroke and hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 7.7), renal disease (OR: 7.2), coagulopathy (OR: 9.9), and atrial fibrillation (OR: 4.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Intracranial aneurysms are reported to occur in up to 3 percent of children and 11 percent of adults with SCD; affected patients often have aneurysms at several sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27-29</a>].

TCD velocity can be measured through several bone windows, including transtemporal, suboccipital, and transorbital approaches, and at various depth settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Children with SCD have TCD velocities that are 40 to 50 percent higher than those in unaffected controls. Flow velocity is inversely proportional to arterial diameter; narrowing of a vessel lumen in the setting of vascular stenosis can therefore be identified by increased flow velocity in the affected segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A focal increase in velocity usually suggests localized arterial stenosis, whereas a bilateral increase may indicate bilateral arterial disease, increased blood flow, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>In addition to the value of high TCD velocities, abnormally <strong>low</strong> TCD velocities in any major vessel may also be an indication of significant cerebral vasculopathy.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies in these patients identified significant vascular and parenchymal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]<strong>.</strong> These findings were corroborated in the SWiTCH trial of secondary stroke prevention, which found that patients with low TCD velocities (50 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec)</span> or unevaluable studies had significantly higher rates of stenosis in the MCA region than those with normal velocities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In an observational study, TCD velocities were lower in patients with HbSC disease than those with HbSS or HbS-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, but the patients were not symptomatic, and the relationship between TCD values and stroke risk was not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>There are no clear guidelines for stroke risk assessment in older adolescents and adults with SCD.

On the first TCD measurement, the majority of children in the longitudinal cohort (84 percent) had a normal TCD result. Among this group, 153 had a follow-up test, and 25 (16 percent) converted to a conditional result. An additional four patients (3 percent) converted directly from a normal to an abnormal result. Of the 51 children who had at least one conditional result, 10 (20 percent) eventually converted to an abnormal result. Abnormal velocities were confirmed in 23 children overall. In this series there were two strokes, one following cleft palate repair in a nine-year-old whose last TCD velocity was 187 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec,</span> and the other in a five-year-old whose most recent TCD result was normal (148 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/sec)</span> 14 months earlier. These data illustrate the importance of continued monitoring of patients regardless of prior TCD results.</p><p>Additional caveats with TCD screening include the dependence of quality and reliability on operator training and experience, the transient elevation of TCD velocities during intercurrent illness, and the transient lowering of TCD velocities by recent transfusion. It is therefore advised that routine TCD screening be performed by designated experienced operators, and that it be deferred if the patient is experiencing any illness or received a transfusion in the preceding two weeks.</p><p>Many children with SCD are not screened with TCD, despite the established value of TCD-based interventions to reduce stroke risk. Impediments include lack of access to centers where TCD is performed, lack of access to chronic transfusion therapy should screening identify an abnormal TCD velocity, and the costs and burdens of regular screening and interventions, which may be substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

The authors of the SIT trial suggested that children have at least one screening MRI without sedation around the time of elementary school entry, though this strategy is not yet common practice. MRA studies of the cerebral vasculature may be more useful to assess for the development of significant vasculopathy, but there are no clear criteria for identifying patients who should undergo such screening, or for how the severity of vasculopathy might correlate with stroke risk. Outside of research studies, we typically perform MRI along with MRA only for children with abnormal TCD studies, within a few months of initiating a stroke reduction program, for those with any other neurological abnormality (eg, seizures, TIAs, syncopal episodes), and for those with significant neurocognitive deficits.</p><p>Other techniques for assessing the risk of stroke in children with SCD have been proposed including the use of more readily available laboratory testing to stratify for the need for TCD measurements, measurement of flow velocities using a submandibular TCD approach, and measuring flow velocity in vessels of the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-stroke-initial-or-recurrent-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>].

The primary endpoint was a composite of non-inferiority for stroke prevention and superiority for reduction of liver iron content. The trial was terminated early at the first scheduled interim analysis for futility for the composite endpoint, which required superiority of phlebotomy over iron chelation for reducing excess iron stores.

(See <a href=\"#H3646685458\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke (secondary stroke prophylaxis)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some children who would otherwise meet criteria for chronic transfusions for primary or secondary stroke prevention may not have access to, or may not be able to tolerate, indefinite chronic transfusions. Some of these children may not otherwise meet criteria for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> therapy, although many will. For children who require stroke prophylaxis and do not otherwise meet criteria for hydroxyurea, we suggest hydroxyurea rather than no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3230563782\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives for primary prophylaxis in special populations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H547649159\" class=\"local\">'Alternatives for secondary prophylaxis in special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute stroke assessment and management in individuals with SCD is addressed separately.
