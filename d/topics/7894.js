Rising healthcare costs and limited provider availability have intensified the search for evidence-based, cost-effective prenatal care that maximizes the outcomes of the mother and child. While traditional prenatal and postpartum care has consisted of one-on-one visits, there are no data suggesting that this care model is optimal. Group prenatal care, in which a small cohort of women with similar due dates participate in a structured prenatal care program facilitated by a clinician, is an alternative model of care that has been associated with benefits for both the patient and the provider, and supported by evidence.</p><p>This review will focus on the structure, outcomes, and patient selection for group prenatal care. Specific components of prenatal care are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-second-and-third-trimesters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Second and third trimesters&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2481780\"><span class=\"h1\">DESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antenatal care has traditionally consisted of one-on-one visits with a clinical provider(s) that occurred at specific time intervals throughout the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While this model allows for individualized attention and risk assessment, it has also been associated with long wait times, fragmented and inconsistent care, and decreased patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Group prenatal care is built on the premise that some types of health care are more effectively and efficiently provided in groups that are facilitated rather than taught. To this end, the group prenatal care model traditionally brings together 8 to 12 low-risk pregnant women, who are matched by gestational age, for prenatal care and facilitated discussion and learning sessions. After each woman has had an initial, individual prenatal visit, this cohort moves through pregnancy care and milestones together as they meet over 8 to 10 visits, each visit lasting approximately 90 to 120 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The facilitators and clinicians are generally the same throughout the sessions. Group sessions can be extended into the postpartum period as well. Of note, group prenatal care is not the same as enhanced prenatal care. In enhanced individual prenatal care, a woman receives more visits or more information using didactic approaches.</p><p>The first part of the session typically includes the standard maternal and fetal assessments. The group prenatal care model encourages women to be involved in their own care; in some programs, the women measure and record their blood pressure and weight, and calculate their gestational age. Data collection can be done with the assistance or supervision of a nurse or medical assistant. Routine physical assessments, such as fundal height and fetal heart rate, are often done in a semi-private area of the group space by one of the clinicians. This semi-private portion of the visit also allows the provider and patient to assess if there are concerns that should be addressed outside of the group context.</p><p>Once the physical evaluations are done, the women participate in a question and discussion period (facilitated by a maternity care provider) that allows for an open exchange of ideas. Group prenatal care clinicians provide facilitative leadership, which emphasizes the critical role that inclusive and engaged discussion plays in improving clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While the facilitator presents information tailored to the group based on gestational age (eg, assessing fetal movement, planning for delivery), the main discussion occurs among the women themselves. Women have the opportunity to hear one another's questions and concerns, receive information in a consistent way, and support one another's goals (such as weight management or smoking reduction). For some women, interacting with others on an emotional level appears to increase their motivation to change behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Partners or family members can be included in group care models as the participants wish. It is important that the sessions end on time to allow the women to return to their jobs and other commitments and to arrange for child care. The check-out process is greatly simplified because all the group meetings can be scheduled in advance, typically at the first session. Additional questions or needs of any woman, such as laboratory evaluations, can be addressed once the group has finished.</p><p>In addition to routine prenatal issues, topics that can be discussed during group time include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy discomforts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparation for labor and delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental health and depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Issues of abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expectations for bringing your baby home from the hospital</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-pregnancy contraception&nbsp;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenthood</p><p/><p>Efficiencies are created because multiple women can receive information simultaneously and can meet with different providers during the initial part of the session (eg, nutritionist, counselor). Once the physical assessments have been completed, the non-facilitating health professionals are available to do other activities.</p><p>If a woman develops a pregnancy complication, she goes through the same triage process as women in traditional care models. Women are referred to specialists, such as a Maternal-Fetal Medicine provider, as needed. When possible, the woman is given the option of continuing routine care with her group and adding specialist visits as needed. Some group care settings have protocols for managing pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes. Information regarding complications or difficult outcomes is shared with the group based on the preferences of the mother. In our practice, we have had mothers, partners, and family members come to meetings to discuss issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2482445\"><span class=\"h2\">Pilot program</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial impetus for developing the group prenatal care model described above was a nurse-midwife's observation that patients often had similar questions, leading to repetitive answers that might have been better addressed by peers or more efficiently answered in a group setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An additional feature was to take advantage of the power for behavioral change that exists within a group.</p><p>An initial program was designed and piloted in a hospital clinic, a community health clinic, and a private obstetrics and gynecology office. In each of these settings, after their initial prenatal visit, women were invited to join a group of 8 to 12 other women with a similar estimated date of delivery. The group met for 10 90-minute visits at regular intervals throughout pregnancy and the early postpartum period. The initial program was named CenteringPregnancy&trade;.</p><p>Prenatal care was provided in an appropriate large space where patients received their health assessments and discussed topics of interest to them with their care provider, as well as interacted informally with other pregnant women, caregivers, and support people. These sessions were led by skilled group leaders, trained in facilitative leadership, who also coordinated the assessment component of care.</p><p>Since its inception, this model has been adopted at over 300 sites, public and private, across the globe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/7,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-12</a>].

To achieve these expanded goals, group models for well-woman prenatal care and <span class=\"nowrap\">well-woman/well-child</span> care focus on the following objectives:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the pregnant woman:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increase well-being before, during, and after pregnancy and improve self-image and self-care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduce unnecessary pregnancy intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Promote breastfeeding skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Improve family planning knowledge and contraception uptake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Promote the development of parenting skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Improve health prior to subsequent pregnancies and beyond childbearing years </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Forge supportive relationships with other pregnant women, healthcare providers, and communities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/infant:</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduce pregnancy complications such as preterm birth or growth restriction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Promote healthy growth and development, immunization, and health supervision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduce injuries, preventable acute and chronic illness, and the need for extended hospitalization after birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the family during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Promote family development and positive parent-infant interaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduce unintended pregnancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide skills to reduce child neglect and family violence</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256685365\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group prenatal care appears to result in at least equivalent obstetric outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/1,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25-29</a>] and high levels of patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/1,9,13,14,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,13,14,30,31</a>] compared with traditional prenatal care. As an example, a 2015 systematic review of four trials totaling over 1800 women found no statistical difference in rates of preterm birth (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-1.00), low birth weight infants (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68-1.23), small for gestational age infants (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68-1.24), and perinatal mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.3-1.25) among women receiving group or traditional prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As only three trials met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis of preterm birth and low birth weight, it is possible that improved obstetric outcomes may be seen for some outcomes, such as preterm birth, or in specific subgroups of women who receive group prenatal care, with larger randomized trials. In addition, because group prenatal care does not have a single, unified definition, it is possible that outcomes vary by the type of group care model being studied.</p><p>Group prenatal care has been associated with an increase in achieving appropriate gestational weight gain and loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/15,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32,33</a>], although not consistently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It has also been associated with an increase in postpartum contraception initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/15,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,35</a>], stress reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], breastfeeding initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/15,30,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30,38,39</a>], and postpartum diabetes screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is also important to note that patient satisfaction is significantly higher for women receiving group prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/13,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30,31</a>]. As an example, in a trial of over 1000 women ages 14 to 25 years, women receiving group prenatal care were significantly more satisfied with their experience and missed fewer appointments than those in individual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Other non-medical benefits of group prenatal care include transformed relationships among women, their families, their communities, and with their healthcare professionals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Thus, group prenatal care can provide a richer, more satisfying experience for the participants, while evidence of improved perinatal outcome is more modest.</p><p>In addition, it is possible that benefits of group care may exist that have not yet been defined or quantified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As an example, group care allows the information content and exchange of ideas to change from one group to another. This fluid structure can adapt to the different needs of each group and contribute to outcome success.</p><p>In summary, group prenatal care is at least equivalent to individual care and provides a greater level of patient satisfaction. Larger, randomly-assigned trials are needed to identify populations who will gain the most benefit from each model.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28874127\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group prenatal care offers non-medical benefits for both patients and providers compared with traditional care models.

This relationship building is what helps to support the development of communities of empowerment and increase patient satisfaction. Group prenatal care can help women understand how to navigate a complicated, and often frightening, healthcare system and take an active role in determining how their needs can be met with the right type of care when it is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>While the group model can decrease patient wait times and increase efficiency across the practice, cost savings depend on the specific setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/38,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,49</a>]. One study that evaluated a financial model of group prenatal care for an urban underserved practice reported cost neutrality and potential cost savings; the outcome varied with the number of clinicians staffing a session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Because billing practices for group care vary among states and insurers, this model may not be universally applicable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H229268935\"><span class=\"h1\">PARTICIPANT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal candidates for group prenatal care have not been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The group care model appears ideal for women who are seeking more active participation, enhanced information, and more social connection during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. To benefit from group care, women need to have the developmental and communication skills to participate in discussion-based care. For some women (eg, women with behavioral or psychiatric disorders), the loose group structure can be difficult for productive participation. Given the data supporting stress reduction and increased satisfaction for women in group prenatal care settings, group prenatal care may be particularly beneficial for women in high-stress or low-support environments.</p><p>Group prenatal care was designed to meet the needs of nulliparous and multiparous women with low-risk pregnancies who successfully completed the first trimester. Available studies have largely included young women of low socioeconomic or minority status. Thus, study results may not be generalizable to other populations. However, as experience with this model has accrued, group care has been successfully offered to wider patient populations, including women with human immunodeficiency virus, gestational diabetes, substance abuse, and past preterm deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>]. Groups have also been conducted for teens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], incarcerated women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and women in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The group care model has demonstrated success outside of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-13</a>] and in non-English speakers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>].</p><p>The most commonly cited reasons for not electing group care are scheduling conflicts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], childcare issues, lack of transportation, and a strong personal relationship with a specific nonparticipating provider.</p><p>Women who have had an initial prenatal visit, attained 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy, and met preselected criteria (eg, low risk or limited types of higher risk) are invited to join a group that brings together women with similar due dates. Groups typically require 8 to 12 women for the most effective discussion dynamics and to be financially viable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. </p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers group prenatal care a reasonable alternative to traditional prenatal care, but women should be allowed to choose between these approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2730022\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLEMENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creation of a group prenatal care model takes considerable planning as well as support, input, and expertise from all levels of staff. While specific group prenatal care models exist, there are no data regarding the optimal set-up for providing group care. One potential advantage of group care models is that they may allow for flexibility in design that adjusts to the specific needs of different populations.</p><p>One group care model recommends formation of a steering committee to plan the program and identification of site champions to promote it. These organizational behavior techniques make sense, but there may be other methods that work as well. In general, to begin a group care program, someone must assess the available resources and identify the system components in need of redesign to accommodate a group model. Non-clinical issues that often need to be addressed include scheduling, appropriate space, marketing, patient recruitment strategies, community support, and initial and ongoing funding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76662055\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTNATAL CARE AND BEYOND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group postnatal care uses the same principles as group prenatal care and provides primary care for both mother and baby during the postpartum year and beyond. Ideally the women continue their postnatal care with their original prenatal cohort and expand on the interactive learning and community building that occurred during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Because the health of the mother and baby are intertwined, care assessment and interventions are more relevant and efficient when done in a dyad context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The postpartum year affects the entire family but especially the mother, who is redefining herself and her own personal goals. Group postnatal care provides women's health clinicians with a model through which they can continue their relationship during the inter-conceptional care period. The sessions are facilitated to encourage women to fully engage in their care and raise issues of importance to their well-being and that of their new baby. Key focus areas for the woman are follow-up of prenatal medical issues, setting and achievement of weight goals, depression screening and treatment, contraception, breastfeeding support, safe sleep, and screening for family violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Because of the dyad focus there often is a need for a team of clinicians to care for the maternal and infant issues. This model encourages continued relationships between women and their providers as well as provides the opportunity for dynamic team collaboration between pediatric and women's health providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1418381\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group prenatal care is built on the premise that some types of health care are more effectively and efficiently provided in groups that are facilitated rather than taught. To this end, the group model brings together 8 to 10 low-risk pregnant woman, who are matched by gestational age, for prenatal care and facilitated discussion and learning sessions. (See <a href=\"#H2481780\" class=\"local\">'Description'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to meeting standard prenatal care recommendations, the objectives of group prenatal care include increasing individual knowledge and skills, establishing supportive relationships and communities, and increasing patients' satisfaction with the care process. (See <a href=\"#H2729646\" class=\"local\">'Objectives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women participating in group prenatal care report high levels of satisfaction in addition to equivalent obstetric outcomes. Group prenatal care appears to provide a richer, more satisfying experience for the participants, while evidence of improved obstetric outcome is more modest. (See <a href=\"#H256685365\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-obstetric benefits of group prenatal care include developing relationships among women who have a common experience, sharing learning and skill development, developing the support of a community, and possibly motivating women to change behavior. (See <a href=\"#H28874127\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The group care model appears ideal for women who are seeking more active participation, enhanced information, and more social connection during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H229268935\" class=\"local\">'Participant selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have had an initial prenatal visit, attained 12 to 16 weeks of pregnancy, and met preselected criteria (eg, low risk or limited types of higher risk) are invited to join a group that brings together women with similar due dates. Groups have 8 to 12 women in them, as well as a <span class=\"nowrap\">provider/facilitator</span> team, and administrative support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creation of a group prenatal care program takes considerable planning by a multidisciplinary steering committee as well as support, input, and expertise from all staff. This committee can work with a consultant experienced in group prenatal care to prepare the system. (See <a href=\"#H2730022\" class=\"local\">'Implementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the session, there is formal check-in, health assessment with the provider, and structured group discussion led by facilitators including the clinician(s) who provide care to the women during the 10 sessions. Women actively participate in their care by performing and recording their own assessments (weight, blood pressure, urine protein, fundal height). (See <a href=\"#H2730022\" class=\"local\">'Implementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There can be additional benefit for the women and their infants if group prenatal care is viewed as a continuity model with the prenatal cohort continuing to receive dyad care in the postpartum year and beyond. (See <a href=\"#H76662055\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal care and beyond'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-prenatal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Catling CJ, Medley N, Foureur M, et al.
