Because not all physicians with these conditions exhibit occupational impairment, it is becoming more common to describe these individuals as &ldquo;physicians with potentially-impairing conditions.&rdquo; The subgroups of greatest concern, and thus of study as well as clinical and regulatory attention, are physicians who exhibit excessive alcohol use, illicit drug use, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prescription drug misuse. </p><p>Most of the published data on this topic are limited to physicians in the United States, where treatment of physicians with substance use disorders is typically overseen by physician health programs (PHPs). Much of the information may be relevant to other types of clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and other countries where these problems have received attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/3-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-12</a>]. PHPs in the United States provide coordination, monitoring, and expertise in the care of physicians (and other healthcare professionals) with potentially-impairing conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which when combined with treatment of the person&rsquo;s substance use disorder (SUD), have generally led to high rates of sustained remission and return to medical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. </p><p>This topic addresses the assessment, treatment, and oversight of physicians impaired by SUDs.

Nearly all of the data on treatment and outcomes for physicians with substance use disorders that have been published in English-language medical journals come from PHPs or similar programs in the United States, Australia, and Canada. PHPs typically do not directly treat these physicians, but are often involved in each stage of physicians&rsquo; recovery, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing guidance to a physician&rsquo;s colleagues, who suspect that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is impaired by substance use, regarding how make a referral for assessment.

Some states have separate programs for different types of clinicians. PHPs also provide coordination and monitoring of physicians impaired by general medical conditions, behavioral problems, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disorders other than SUDs. (See <a href=\"#H471620371\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590667266\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a physician has a potentially-impairing condition, regulatory agencies or their proxies determine the status of the physician&rsquo;s license to practice medicine, eg, whether the license is revoked or suspended, whether and under what terms the physician can return to work, and whether the physician&rsquo;s status is publically disclosed. </p><p>Regulatory agencies in some countries and in some US states delegate the ability to impose sanctions to the physician&rsquo;s addiction treatment team or PHP. </p><p>Most PHPs in the United States operate independently from state medical boards. This allows the PHP to serve as a confidential buffer between the state board and physician. These PHPs tend to consider <strong>severe </strong>sanctions (eg, permanent license revocation) as counterproductive, because such sanctions may discourage physicians from reporting a colleague or from accepting help for themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In some US states (eg, Maryland), multiple physician assistance programs exist to provide alternative processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A voluntary, confidential physician health program that encourages help-seeking </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A board-affiliated program for physicians more resistant to intervention who have been referred for disciplinary action against their license</p><p/><p>Sanctions are generally utilized to protect patients from care delivered by an impaired physician when other options have been exhausted. PHPs or treating clinicians sometimes use the threat of such sanctions as &ldquo;leverage&rdquo;, ie, to motivate a recalcitrant impaired physician to participate in treatment. Research has suggested that retaining a medical license can be an effective component of contingency management to encourage sustained abstinence among physicians with substance use disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Though concerns have been raised regarding the ethics of this practice and the potential for conflicts of interest between PHPs and <span class=\"nowrap\">evaluation/treatment</span> programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], others have noted that medical licensure exists specifically to support the &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; that requires protecting patients from the possibility of harm due to physician impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Most physicians who are involuntarily referred to PHPs generally have positive clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and express satisfaction with their participation in the PHP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178047\"><span class=\"h1\">COORDINATION AND MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coordination may include contact with colleagues of the physician who have recognized that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> may have a substance use disorder (SUD), referral of the physician to qualified addiction specialists for assessment and treatment, acting as an intermediary between the physician and the state medical board, and work with the physician&rsquo;s employer, colleagues, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staff to facilitate the physician&rsquo;s return to work.</p><p>Monitoring of the physician&rsquo;s behavior is ongoing during and after treatment and continues following the physician&rsquo;s return to work. During treatment it involves regular contact with treating clinicians and review of their written reports. Contact with the physician&rsquo;s employer, colleagues, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staff occurs before and after the physician&rsquo;s return to work. Monitoring of the physician may include phone contacts, <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> attendance at a weekly or monthly monitoring meeting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a workplace practice monitor who observes the physician and provides regular reports regarding <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> functioning on the job. </p><p>Routine random urine tests are conducted to verify the physician&rsquo;s abstinence, initially weekly in many cases and less frequently when good results have been reliably attained. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22257285\"><span class=\"h2\">Contingency contracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physicians participating in a PHP are typically asked to enter into a contingency contract, which describes the expectations of the physician. PHP contingency contracts for physicians with moderate to severe SUD are typically five or more years in duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They impose conditions upon the physician&rsquo;s behavior in return for a pathway to recovery and return to medical practice. Conditions of such a contract may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawal from clinical practice until he or she is determined to be able to return to practice safely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of all addicting substances (including alcohol and over-the-counter medications such as sleep aids and antihistamines) and behaviors (eg, gambling) that pathologically stimulate the reward areas of the brain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation in adequate and appropriate SUD treatment, as determined by the physician&rsquo;s addiction specialists and the PHP, as well as other mental health care as indicated. (See <a href=\"#H471620371\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation in weekly or monthly group sessions with other PHP-contracted physicians, led by an addictions counselor who reports back to the PHP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Random drug testing.

(See <a href=\"#H1458088773\" class=\"local\">'Return to work'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Contingency contracts between a physician and PHP provide the basis for the PHP&rsquo;s subsequent actions. As an example, the physician&rsquo;s failure to attend the weekly group meeting would be regarded as a violation of the contract, and could trigger an immediate drug test. Serious violations (eg, positive or missed drug tests, use of unapproved narcotic medication) would likely warrant re-evaluation by an addiction specialist to determine whether further formal treatment is needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471620335\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physician with a substance use disorder (SUD) is optimally evaluated and treated by an addiction specialty team, composed of an internist or psychiatrist with expertise in addiction, a psychiatrist or psychologist, nurse, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> addiction counselor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This team needs to be adept at treating SUDs, and additionally cognizant of medical practices, licensure issues, and physician work environments.</p><p>Clinicians who have had a collegial relationship or friendship with the patient should not participate in the evaluation and treatment of the physician with an SUD. This may require assessment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment to be performed outside of the physician&rsquo;s own medical community to protect the patient&rsquo;s confidentiality and to avoid issues of transference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-assessment-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and enabling that could cloud the judgment of peers and create professional conflicts.</p><p>The evaluation should include a comprehensive psychiatric assessment, with additional emphasis on addiction and workplace issues.

Neuropsychological testing can determine the severity of other neurologic damage. As an example, given the safety-sensitive nature of medical practice and specific specialties (eg, anesthesiology, surgery), &ldquo;minor&rdquo; deficits in processing speed and fine motor coordination may adversely impact on the physician&rsquo;s ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety. Results can also be used in confronting denial and determining fitness for return to practice. </p><p>Comprehensive drug testing is an important part of assessment when used to validate a patient&rsquo;s history of drug use and to confront denial. This typically includes urine tests and may include hair <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nail testing.

(See <a href=\"#H1179744\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physician health programs (PHP), in the United States and other countries, provide coordination and monitoring of impaired physicians. PHPs may be involved directly in regulatory activities or serve as an intermediary between the physician and the state medical board. PHPs may refer the patient to a clinical team <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have input into the physician&rsquo;s assessment and treatment, but do not directly provide assessment and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1179744\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H590668122\" class=\"local\">'Physician health programs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PHPs in some states in the US oversee care for other healthcare professionals (eg, nurses, pharmacists, and veterinarians) in addition to physicians. Other states have separate programs for other types of clinicians. PHPs also provide coordination and monitoring of physicians impaired by general medical conditions, behavioral problems, and psychiatric disorders other than SUDs. (See <a href=\"#H590670525\" class=\"local\">'Other health professionals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physicians with an SUD typically enter into a contract with the PHP of five or more years duration, in which the physician agrees to conditions including abstinence, treatment, and extended monitoring in return for a pathway to recovery and eventual return to medical practice. (See <a href=\"#H22257285\" class=\"local\">'Contingency contracts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physician with an SUD is optimally evaluated by an addiction specialty team, composed of a physician (typically in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry) with expertise in substance use issues of health care professionals, psychologist, nurse, and addiction counselor. This team needs to be adept at treating SUDs, and additionally cognizant of medical practices, licensure issues, and physician work environments. (See <a href=\"#H471620335\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SUD treatment for physicians, like any patient, consists of addiction counseling, mutual help groups, medication, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychotherapy. Other aspects of treatment may be specific to physicians, such as addressing risks an addicted physician poses to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> patients, exposure to other physicians with SUDs (including physicians with long-term sobriety), and learning drug refusal skills aimed at controlling his or her access to abusable medications at work. (See <a href=\"#H471620371\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes of PHP-supervised SUD treatment are generally considered to be exceptionally good, with between 75 and 90 percent of physicians and other healthcare professionals found to complete SUD treatment, return to work, and remain working at five years follow up. Outcomes of physicians <span class=\"nowrap\">treated/monitored</span> in non-PHP models have not been studied. (See <a href=\"#H1458086548\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of physician health programs'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of substance use disorders, in particular opioid use disorders, are higher among anesthesiologists compared to physicians in other specialties. Anesthesiologists who participated in PHPs appear to have outcomes similar to other physicians. Anesthesia residents with a SUD, however, have been found to have significant rates of relapse and mortality after PHP completion, particularly among those who return to an anesthesia residency program. (See <a href=\"#H1458089336\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors considered in assessing a physician&rsquo;s readiness to return to practice include completion of treatment for SUD and co-occurring conditions, sustained abstinence, his or her ability to manage stresses and triggers, and motivation to follow continuing care plan. Most physicians are required to have a workplace monitor and processes that address the physician&rsquo;s access to medications.
