In one report, a patient developed a dry cough on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of illness followed by dyspnea and hypoxia on the 11<sup>th</sup> day of illness; prior to that, he had only nonspecific signs and symptoms (malaise, myalgias, low-grade fever) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Several individuals with asymptomatic infection have been identified among contacts of patients with symptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-25</a>]. As an example, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health screened more than 3000 close contacts of patients using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs and identified seven healthcare workers with MERS-CoV infection, two of whom were asymptomatic and five of whom had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A study that modeled clinical data from active versus passive surveillance estimated that the ratio of symptomatic to total infections was strongly age related, rising from 11 percent in those under 20 years of age to 88 percent in those 70 years old or older, with a parallel rise in the case-fatality ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>It appears that many individuals who have been reported to be asymptomatic have in fact had signs and symptoms of illness.

Of these 33 people, 79 percent reported at least one symptom during the month before testing and 70 percent reported more than one symptom. Unexpectedly, 36 percent of the individuals reported the presence of signs and symptoms as the reason for undergoing MERS-CoV testing, even though they had been identified as being asymptomatic.</p><p>However, one report describes asymptomatic infection in two men who had contact with infected dromedary camels and who were identified by active surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Many additional cases and clusters of MERS-CoV infections have been detected subsequently in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F95981\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95981 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89703 \">figure 2</a>). Cases have also been reported from other regions, including North Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102411 \">table 1</a>). In countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula, patients developed illness after returning from the Arabian Peninsula or through close contact with infected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H3818971095\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology#H15168486\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia that resulted in laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV in 23 individuals, the median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% CI 1.9-14.7 days). (See <a href=\"#H3776417820\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency and severity of symptoms are directly proportional to age. Most reported patients with MERS-CoV infection have been adults with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and some have had acute kidney injury. Many patients have required mechanical ventilation, and some have required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Other clinical manifestations that have been reported are gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea), pericarditis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. (See <a href=\"#H3352663212\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing applied to respiratory secretions is the diagnostic assay of choice. Ideally, lower respiratory tract, upper respiratory tract, <strong>and</strong> serum samples should be obtained. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be a priority for collection and testing. To increase the likelihood of detecting MERS-CoV, we suggest collection of multiple specimens from different sites and at different times. (See <a href=\"#H2707356371\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3762552922\" class=\"local\">'Preferred tests and specimen types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with an acute respiratory infection who have an epidemiologic link to MERS-CoV or who have had an unusual or unexpected clinical course (especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment) should be tested for MERS-CoV. Certain other patients may also require evaluation for MERS-CoV infection. Specific recommendations regarding whom to test are presented above. (See <a href=\"#H616795503\" class=\"local\">'Whom to test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that probable and confirmed cases be reported within 24 hours of classification through the Regional Contact Point for International Health Regulations at the appropriate WHO Regional Office. (See <a href=\"#H777756529\" class=\"local\">'Reporting cases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional information about MERS-CoV can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/&amp;token=ggn9yyW/PO1bhSWi4ovt9uKartM+4aQx9vDq5Mzw3FcWoQgf5ZMGYieSkPpdPk3JPBtV4wwJLfV0kpQsgsCDGw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=106589\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WHO's website</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsX5Ptv2cRVLRLymlbY85ZNQ7X5axMXkb/w8fh2ohquGNFQYSC5SxOJiLg8WWouDQmQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=106589\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website</a>.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">ProMed Mail: Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate; Archive Number: 20120920.1302733 http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20120920.1302733 (Accessed on April 22, 2013).</li><li class=\"breakAll\">World Health Organization.
