Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is highly effective and well-tolerated by most patients.</p><p>VIT for patients with allergies to honey bee, yellow jacket, yellow hornet, white-faced hornet, and wasp is administered using purified venoms, whereas whole body extracts are used in immunotherapy for fire ant allergy. The techniques, adverse effects, and safety of VIT will be reviewed here. Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action of VIT, as well as immunotherapy for fire ant allergy, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues in the administration of VIT include venom selection, dosing, injection protocol, premedications, and adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Venom selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The venoms used for immunotherapy are the same as those used for skin testing. In the United States, there are two companies that supply venom extracts for skin testing and treatment: Hollister-Stier Laboratories (Spokane, Washington) and ALK-Abell&oacute; (Round Rock, Texas). Depot preparations are available in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], although not in the United States. The discussion herein does <strong>not</strong> apply to depot products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple versus single venom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, patients are usually treated with all of the venoms to which they had a positive skin test, with the goal of providing maximal coverage for future sting events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This approach ensures that a patient who has reacted to a yellow jacket sting, for example, is not left with doubts about the expected outcome of a sting from a different Hymenoptera insect (to which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> had a positive venom skin test but had never been stung, such as a honey bee). Thus, skin testing should be performed with venoms from each of the insects relevant to the geographic area, and treatment should include all of the venoms to which the patient showed skin test sensitivity.</p><p>Skin testing is the preferred method of determining sensitivity to venoms, but sometimes measurement of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) may provide additional information. It is most often recommended when all of the venom skin tests are negative.</p><p>Single VIT is used at some centers, and available data indicate that the effectiveness of this approach is also high at 75 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. No head-to-head comparative studies are available.</p><p>In North America, the most common flying Hymenoptera insect to cause allergy is the yellow jacket, except for some areas of the south central and southwestern United States, where wasps and honey bees are predominant, respectively.</p><p>The vast majority of yellow jacket-allergic patients also have positive skin tests to yellow hornet and white-faced hornet venoms, because these insects are in the same Hymenoptera subfamily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80397 \">figure 1</a>). These patients are usually treated with a mixed vespid extract containing the full dose of each venom. Similarly, if a patient has positive test results to two vespid venoms, such as yellow jacket and white-faced hornet, but not to other vespid venoms, the patient could be treated with either yellow jacket and white-faced hornet as two separate injections or with commercially prepared mixed vespid. However, the author prefers giving mixed vespid venom because the cross-reactivity of the vespid venoms results in a higher equivalent dose of the other venoms than would be received by giving each separately. Additionally, the author has seen patients who were initially negative to one of the vespids and later were shown to be positive to that venom. Finally, most patients would prefer a single injection. About 50 percent of yellow jacket-allergic patients are also sensitized to <em>Polistes</em> wasp (same family) and should receive this venom as a separate injection.</p><p>Venoms should not be mixed, with the exception of the commercially prepared mixed vespid products. Mixing of other venoms can result in proteolytic degradation of venom proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretreatment with the H1 antihistamine terfenadine (no longer available) reduced VIT reactions (local and systemic) in randomized, controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. It is our practice to advise the patient to take a minimally sedating H1 antihistamine each day that an injection is to be administered. Some experts advise patients to take premedications throughout the duration of VIT, while others discontinue it over time if the patient has not had local reactions. Pretreatment with antihistamines can also improve the efficacy of VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A report suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> may also reduce local reactions, but we have not found this necessary in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H947131\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of baseline tryptase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline tryptase measurements are helpful in assessing a patient's risk for systemic reactions in response to the dose escalation phase of VIT. Baseline levels should be measured after the sting reaction has fully resolved and the patient is in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> usual state of health. Baseline serum levels above 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> should prompt an evaluation for a mast cell disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a prospective, observational study of 680 patients receiving honey bee or vespid VIT, serum tryptase values correlated with the risk of adverse systemic reactions to therapy, such that an increase in baseline tryptase from 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> increased the risk for a systemic reaction by a factor of approximately 3.8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of note, this study defined an adverse systemic reaction as systemic symptoms requiring any measure or medication for treatment, as determined by the supervising clinician.</p><p>The measurement of baseline tryptase is also useful in assessing other aspects of a patient's risk. Specifically, elevated baseline tryptase is associated with more severe reactions to stings in general, more frequent treatment failure (ie, failure to achieve protection), and a greater risk of relapse after stopping VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should wait 30 minutes after each injection, as systemic allergic reactions to the injections are most likely to occur within the first 30 minutes after administration. In addition, VIT should be administered by staff who are trained to recognize and treat systemic allergic reactions and in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis. In most cases, VIT is given in the prescribing allergist's office, although exceptions are sometimes made. The risks associated with administration of immunotherapy in remote locations are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Systemic reactions to VIT'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alterations in venom extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One should be cautious if a switch is necessary from the venom of one company to another once a patient has begun VIT, because source materials may vary and the venom products may not be equivalent. Methods for changing venom extracts in a patient already undergoing VIT have not been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VIT is traditionally initiated with a dose between 0.001 and 0.05 mcg of venom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51030 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64856 \">table 2</a>). However, a higher initial dose of 1 mcg is also well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This relatively wide range of starting doses necessitates that clinicians use judgment in choosing a starting point for an individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A maintenance dose of 100 mcg per venom (or 300 mcg for the mixed vespid preparation that contains three venoms) was initially chosen for both adults and children because it represented approximately twice the venom content of a honey bee sting or three to four times that of a vespid sting. This dose has been used as maintenance in the majority of published protocols and is recommended in the Hollister-Stier Laboratories and ALK-Abell&oacute; prescribing information. Studies of lower or higher maintenance doses in adults and children are more limited:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One center reported a 10-year experience with a maintenance dose of 50 mcg, in which most patients received treatment with a single venom (the majority received yellow jacket venom) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There were 258 subsequent stings, of which only 3 resulted in systemic reactions. However, a smaller prospective study compared the outcomes in patients treated with 50 mcg with patients treated with 100 mcg and found that the lower dose protected 79 percent of subjects from systemic reactions on challenge, while the higher dose protected 96 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therefore, we suggest a maintenance dose of 100 mcg for adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doses higher than 100 mcg per injection are occasionally needed to achieve protection. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower venom doses may provide adequate protection in children. A small study found that children produced a more vigorous immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to VIT (approximately twice that of adults), suggesting that one-half the dose of venom might be protective in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A retrospective study found that 50 mcg of honey bee venom (single venom VIT) protected children from recurrent systemic reactions in 94 percent of field stings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another report of 54 children treated with 50 mcg maintenance doses of various venoms, 21 were stung during or after a five-year course of VIT and none had a systemic reaction, including several with initially severe reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A 50 mcg maintenance dose might be effective in children. However, the author prefers to use a 100 mcg dose for children as well as adults.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various schedules of injections may be used, and each manufacturer provides a suggested injection schedule in the package insert. The choice of schedule is based upon the urgency of the patient's need for treatment, convenience, and the clinician's experience and comfort with specific protocols:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Traditional protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional protocols involve one to three injections per week and reach maintenance doses in two to four months. Traditional protocols are widely used in the United States.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The schedule provided by Hollister-Stier Laboratories in their packing insert involves once weekly injections. Maintenance is reached in 15 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51030 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The schedule provided by ALK-Abell&oacute; is more rapid, requiring three injections per week and reaching the maintenance dose in 8 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64856 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p>The two approaches above are equally effective, and the frequency of systemic reactions is equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, at least one study found that there were more systemic reactions overall in patients following the slower regimen, presumably because they received more injections during the build-up phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Accelerated protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated protocols include &quot;rush&quot; and &quot;ultra-rush&quot; schedules, although these terms are not strictly defined. Accelerated protocols are popular in some European centers and United States military hospitals and offer certain advantages, such as the rapid achievement of clinical protection for the patient at very high risk for recurrent sting (eg, a beekeeper) who suffered a severe initial reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Rush schedules also require fewer visits, which is helpful for patients who do not live near a medical facility.</p><p>Rush protocols are generally effective and safe. Systemic reactions do not appear to be more common with most rush protocols for VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. As an example, a two- to five-hour regimen of VIT was described in which 10 gradually increasing doses were administered at 10- to 15-minute intervals to achieve a total dose of about 55 mcg per venom by the end of day 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This was followed by an accelerated build-up over three weeks to a maintenance dose of 100 mcg. Patients were not routinely premedicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among 77 patients treated with this protocol, 5 percent developed diffuse urticaria on day 1, but treatment was otherwise uncomplicated, and all completed the procedure. In fact, several studies have found that rates of systemic reactions are actually lower with accelerated compared with conventional schedules for VIT, and accelerated protocols are sometimes used for patients who cannot tolerate conventional schedules because of frequent systemic reactions. Thus, most rush VIT can be performed in a properly staffed and equipped outpatient clinic.</p><p>Ultra-rush protocols, in which the maintenance dose is reached in one or two days, may carry an increased risk of systemic reactions and are usually performed in the hospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Interval between maintenance injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maintenance dose of 100 mcg is given every four weeks initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23,24</a>]. In most patients, the interval between maintenance injections can be lengthened further without impacting the efficacy of VIT. There is no specific test to identify patients in whom this is appropriate. Rather, it has been safely accomplished in patients who have not experienced systemic reactions to either the injections or to subsequent stings.</p><p>Several approaches to lengthening the period between maintenance injections have been described, although these have not been compared directly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 update to the practice parameter published by the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (a group representing the leading American allergy societies) notes that a maintenance interval of four weeks is recommended for indefinite treatment in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product package inserts. However, it states that &quot;experts in the field support the regimen of a four-week maintenance interval for 12 to 18 months followed by a six-week interval for 12 to 18 months and then eight-week intervals&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As examples, the author of this topic has the following approach: every four weeks for one year, then every six weeks for one year, then every eight weeks for one year, then extend some patients at 10- to 12-week intervals. The section editor's approach is similar, but progresses every 18 months, instead of yearly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least two studies support longer maintenance intervals and advancing to those intervals more rapidly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One observational study started with either conventional build-up (weekly over three to four months) or a three-day rush protocol, then lengthened the interval between maintenance injections as follows: once at one month, once at six weeks, once at two months, and three-month intervals thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While on three-month intervals, 36 patients experienced 49 field stings, 47 of which were tolerated without a systemic reaction. The other two stings resulted in mild systemic reactions that resolved without treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another observational study, 186 patients receiving single venom VIT were built-up to maintenance over three weeks, then given the choice of conventional intervals of four to six weeks between injections or extended intervals. In the latter group (76 patients, one-half of which were allergic to honey bee), the intervals between maintenance injections were lengthened in a stepwise manner until an interval of three months was reached after 4.5 months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Three-month intervals were continued until the start of the fifth year of VIT, at which point the interval was extended to four months. While receiving every three-month maintenance injections, patients in this cohort sustained 205 stings, 7 of which resulted in a systemic reaction. After four years of VIT, the patients getting injections at four-month intervals sustained 39 stings, 1 of which resulted in a systemic reaction. In the conventional group, there were 167 stings, 11 of which resulted in a systemic reaction. Thus, the three-month interval was as effective as the four- to six-week interval at maintaining protection from recurrent systemic reactions.</p><p/><p>Intervals of longer than three to four months have not been determined to be safe. Specifically, the authors of one of the above studies determined that a six-month interval was not adequate to maintain protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In light of the above studies, it is reasonable to extend the interval between maintenance injections in those patients who have not had systemic reactions to stings using one of the approaches above. We suggest extending this interval to 6 to 8 weeks in most cases, and up to 12 weeks at the discretion of the allergist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS AND SAFETY OF VIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VIT is well-tolerated by most patients. The most significant adverse effect of VIT is a systemic allergic reaction to the venom injections. Local reactions at the site of administration are far more common, although these are not dangerous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic reactions to VIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 3 to 12 percent of patients have treatment-induced systemic reactions. The majority of these reactions are mild and easily treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28</a>]. This systemic reaction rate is similar to that seen in conventional pollen immunotherapy when effective immunizing doses are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients receiving honey bee VIT and those with elevated baseline tryptase measurements are at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Systemic reactions do not appear to be more common with most rush protocols.</p><p>The majority of systemic reactions to VIT occur in the dose escalation phase of treatment. For this reason, many clinicians prefer that VIT be administered in an allergist's office until the maintenance dose is reached.</p><p>If a systemic reaction occurs, the patient should be evaluated by a clinician as soon as possible after the event to determine if there were any patient-related or external factors that may have contributed to the reaction, such as a dosing error, failure to premedicate, or an increase in the patient's baseline asthma or allergy symptoms.</p><p>A baseline serum total tryptase should be measured if not done in the past. If tryptase is persistently elevated and the patient is found to have an underlying mast cell disorder, then VIT should be continued because the patient is at high risk for severe reactions to stings. In this situation, pretreatment with one or more doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> (ie, anti-immunoglobulin E [IgE] therapy) can help the patient tolerate continued treatment. The use of omalizumab in patients with mastocytosis and venom allergy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis#H3958736272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Venom immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients will not have elevated tryptase. In this setting, the schedule should be interrupted and adjusted when a systemic reaction occurs. We typically ask the patient to return one week later and administer one-half of the causal dose as the next injection. If tolerated, the dose is increased on a weekly basis until the patient again reaches the maintenance dose.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1288269\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent systemic reactions to VIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, patients experience repeated systemic reactions to the venom injections. In this situation, the nature of the patient's symptoms should be carefully evaluated, and a serum tryptase should be obtained after the reaction (ideally 30 minutes to 3 hours from the onset of symptoms) if there is doubt about whether these symptoms are anaphylaxis. In the experience of the author and section editor, a large proportion of these patients have constitutional symptoms that are not anaphylaxis and may be related to release of inflammatory mediators or cytokines at the local injection site. Most of these reactions will resolve spontaneously with further escalation of the dose. However, other explanations for recurrent reactions to VIT are extreme sensitivity to venom or the presence of an underlying mast cell disorder.</p><p>When recurrent systemic reactions to VIT occur in a patient (with <strong>no</strong> evidence of an underlying mast cell disorder) who has not yet reached the full maintenance dose, we suggest attempting to get the patient to tolerate a full maintenance dose. This can usually be achieved either by performing a two-day rush protocol to reach maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] during which the patient is hospitalized or by administering one or more doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> (ie, anti-IgE therapy) and then continuing dose escalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Anaphylaxis to human serum albumin in the diluent used for VIT was described in a case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The patient described had been tolerating VIT for over two years and then developed anaphylaxis after two consecutive maintenance injections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A less serious but more frequent problem with VIT is the large local reactions that occur in 25 percent of children and 50 percent of adults, usually at doses of 20 to 30 mcg of venom. Although bothersome, local reactions do not predict an increased risk of future systemic reactions to treatment. The best way to manage these is to reassure the patient and proceed with the injection schedule, as these reactions generally do not continue to occur at the higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>If a patient is experiencing significant discomfort <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inconvenience because of large local reactions to the injections, one or more of the following may be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply cold packs to the site of the injection(s) immediately after administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that the patient is taking an antihistamine several hours before the injections are administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divide the problematic dose(s) between the patient's arms, such that one-half of the volume is delivered to each site. As the dose increases, it should be again given as a single injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider adding premedication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, 10 mg orally, several hours before the injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We have also had some anecdotal success in reducing large local reactions at a specific step in VIT by giving the same venom dose using a smaller volume of a higher concentration venom solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No long-term toxicity or side effects have been associated with VIT thus far.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING VIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We usually assess patients after the initial four to six weeks of VIT and then again at six months. Patients who are tolerating VIT without difficulty can generally be reassessed annually after the first year of treatment. At these visits, the patient's injection schedule should be reviewed, noting that dose and frequency of injections have reached the desired parameters. The patient should be questioned about any stings that may have occurred since the last visit and the symptoms that resulted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no simple test to determine with certainty how well VIT is protecting a given patient from a future sting reaction. One study using sting challenges suggested that most patients are protected from recurrent systemic reactions after six weeks of conventional (nonrush) VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The following tests provide some information about how well VIT is working, but none of them are conclusive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Venom-specific IgG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venom-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) may be measured, and a serum level of &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is characteristic of patients who are protected from repeat stings in the first three years of VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, values &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> may also be seen in patients with adequate protection, and after four years of VIT, most patients are protected from recurrent systemic reactions regardless of their venom-specific IgG level. Thus, venom-specific IgG must be interpreted in the context of the patient's other clinical and laboratory data. The utility and cost-effectiveness of measuring venom-specific IgG routinely is unclear, since there are so few treatment failures with VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. We do not measure venom-specific IgG in all patients in our practice, but rather use this determination to assess patients with apparent treatment failures. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Venom-specific IgE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) is used in research, but is <strong>not</strong> routinely used in clinical practice to monitor the progress or success of VIT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Venom skin tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over time, venom skin tests tend to become smaller and will revert to negative in a significant proportion of patients. In children, 45 percent of those who had received three to six years of VIT developed negative venom skin tests to one or more venoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In adults, 20 percent had negative venom skin tests after five years of VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Most experts repeat skin testing when deciding whether or not to stop VIT after five years of treatment, although this practice is not based on controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the patient is interested in discontinuing VIT and skin test reactivity is clearly diminished, then most clinicians will stop treatment after consideration of the other criteria and risk factors described below (see <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> below). If skin reactivity has not decreased or has increased, the patient is generally treated for an additional year or two and then reassessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Sting challenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sting challenges are frequently used in research, but are not recommended for routine clinical practice. These procedures are associated with some risk, and the lack of response on a single sting challenge does not guarantee that the patient will not react to a subsequent sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment failure (ie, recurrent systemic reactions to stings despite VIT) may be seen in patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis or other mast cell disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. A serum tryptase level should be obtained as an initial screen for an underlying mast cell disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increasing the maintenance dose up to 200 mcg is effective in most individuals who experienced sting reactions while receiving the 100 mcg maintenance dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians measure venom-specific IgG in such patients, since a level &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is consistent with incomplete protection. However, aside from observing the response to a subsequent sting, there is no entirely reliable way to identify patients who are not adequately protected by standard doses of VIT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients remain sufficiently protected after completing five years of immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/39,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,44-46</a>]. After discontinuation, recurrent reactions are rare for a year or two, after which there is approximately a 10 percent chance of a systemic reaction with each subsequent sting. Indefinite VIT is considered for patients with any of the following characteristics, which may account for more than one-third of all of those receiving VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactions to past stings were life-threatening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Honey bee venom allergy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic reactions to the venom injections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety concerning the residual risk of a repeat reaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those requiring higher venom doses for adequate protection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with elevated baseline serum tryptase or systemic mastocytosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis#H3958736272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Venom immunotherapy'</a>)</p><p/><p>For patients on indefinite VIT, the risk of recurrent systemic reactions is believed to remain low (ie, less than 5 percent per sting).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234276311\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, the patient is treated with all of the venoms relevant to a geographic location to which that individual tested positive. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Venom selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest premedicating all patients with an H1 antihistamine prior to each venom injection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schedules of injections vary, but may be divided into traditional and accelerated (rush and ultra-rush). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Choice of protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to initiating VIT, we recommend measurement of baseline tryptase values in all patients with severe reactions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reactions involving hypotension. The utility of measuring tryptase in patients with mild systemic reactions is less clear. (See <a href=\"#H947131\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of baseline tryptase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 3 to 12 percent of patients have treatment-induced systemic reactions with both traditional and rush schedules. The majority of these reactions are mild and easily treated. Doses should be reduced temporarily following a systemic reaction. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Systemic reactions to VIT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local reactions to the injections occur in 25 to 50 percent of patients and are not associated with an increased risk of a systemic reaction. Local reactions do not require dose adjustment. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Local reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no one accepted approach to monitoring VIT and no simple test to determine with certainty how well VIT is protecting a given patient from a future sting reaction. However, most patients do not experience recurrent systemic reactions to stings once receiving VIT, so this is not a common clinical problem. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring VIT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have not experienced systemic reactions to either the VIT injections or to subsequent stings, we suggest lengthening the interval between maintenance injections to 6 to 8 weeks in most cases and as long as 12 weeks at the discretion of the allergist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). There are several approaches for doing this. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Interval between maintenance injections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are protected after five years of VIT, but up to one-third may have factors which lead the patient and clinician to prefer continuing treatment indefinitely. Candidates for prolonged VIT include those with life-threatening past reactions, honey bee venom allergy, reactions to the injections or a recurrent sting during therapy, mastocytosis or elevated baseline serum tryptase, or the desire to reduce the risk to the lowest possible level.
