These events mostly occur in patients with structural heart disease (that may not have been previously diagnosed), particularly coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation, and the event is called SCD if the patient dies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention.</p><p>The specific causes of SCA vary with the population studied and patient age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62184\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62184 \">table 1</a>). SCA most commonly results from hemodynamic collapse due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the setting of structural heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80454\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80454 \">waveform 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The outcome following SCA depends upon numerous factors including the underlying cause and the rapidity of resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supportive data for advanced cardiac life support in adults with sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most individuals suffering from SCA become unconscious within seconds to minutes as a result of insufficient cerebral blood flow. There are usually no premonitory symptoms. If symptoms are present, they are nonspecific and include chest discomfort, palpitations, shortness of breath, and weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various criteria have been used to define SCA and SCD in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Difficulties in deriving a specific definition include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Events are witnessed in only two-thirds of cases, making the diagnosis difficult to establish in many instances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not possible to restrict the definition of SCA to documented cases of VF since the cardiac rhythm at clinical presentation is unknown in many cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of symptoms prior to SCA generally defines the suddenness of death. However, the duration of symptoms is unknown in approximately one-third of cases.</p><p/><p>For these reasons, operational criteria for SCA and SCD have been proposed that do not rely upon the cardiac rhythm at the time of the event. The criteria focus on the out-of-hospital occurrence of a presumed sudden pulseless condition and the <strong>absence</strong> of evidence of a noncardiac condition (eg, central airway obstruction, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism) as the cause of cardiac arrest.</p><p>The 2006 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/HRS)</span> to establish data standards for electrophysiology included definitions to guide documentation in research and clinical practice.</p><p>The following definitions of SCA and SCD were presented:</p><p>&quot;[Sudden] cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation. If corrective measures are not taken rapidly, this condition progresses to sudden death. Cardiac arrest should be used to signify an event as described above, that is reversed, usually by CPR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> defibrillation or cardioversion, or cardiac pacing. Sudden cardiac death should not be used to describe events that are not fatal.&quot;</p><p>Throughout this topic we will use the terms SCA and SCD as defined in the 2006 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/HRS</span> document. However, many continue to use SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Death certificate data suggest that SCD accounts for approximately 15 percent of the total mortality in the United States and other industrialized countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, death certificate data may overestimate the prevalence of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In a prospective evaluation of deaths in one county in Oregon, SCD was implicated in 5.6 percent of annual mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In absolute terms, the estimated number of sudden cardiac deaths in the United States in 1999 was approximately 450,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Despite advances in the treatment of heart disease, the outcome of patients experiencing SCA remains poor, although the prognosis varies significantly according to the initial rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of experiencing SCA is increased by a number of factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,8</a>]. The incidence increases dramatically with age and with underlying cardiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59028 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52309 \">figure 2</a>). In addition, men are two to three times more likely to experience SCA than women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59028 \">figure 1</a>). Among 161,808 post-menopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative and were followed for an average of 10.8 years, the incidence rate of SCD was 2.4 per 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">women/year,</span> and nearly one-half of women who experienced SCD did not have prior clinically-recognized coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of the influence of underlying cardiac disease on the risk of SCA is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of SCA is increased 6- to 10-fold in the presence of clinically recognized heart disease, and two- to four-fold in the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCD is the mechanism of death in over 60 percent of patients with known CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/4,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,11</a>].

The etiologies of SCA are discussed in detail separately, but will be briefly reviewed here.

Among patients with CHD, SCA can occur both during an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in the setting of chronic, otherwise stable CHD (often such patients have had prior myocardial damage and scar that serves as a substrate for SCA). SCD is indeed more common in the absence of an identifiable acute cardiac event.

These include ischemia, electrolyte disturbances (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia), the proarrhythmic effect of some antiarrhythmic drugs, autonomic nervous system activation, and psychosocial factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H1240264379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Transient or reversible causes'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, SCA can result from commotio cordis in which VF is precipitated by direct trauma over precordium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Commotio cordis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116036026\"><span class=\"h2\">Warning symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Warning&quot; symptoms may precede the SCA event in a large number of patients, but symptoms may be unrecognized or minimized by patients, and subsequent ascertainment of symptoms is often limited, particularly in patients who do not survive the event. In addition, patients who have SCA and are resuscitated often have a retrograde amnesia and hence do not remember events or symptoms that may have been present. In a community-based study of 839 patients with SCA between 2002 and 2012 in whom symptom assessment could be ascertained (either from the surviving patient or from family members, witnesses at the scene of the event, or medical records from the four weeks leading up to the event), 430 patients (51 percent) were identified as having warning symptoms within four weeks preceding SCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Eighty percent of patients experienced symptoms at least one hour before SCA, with 34 percent having symptoms more than 24 hours before SCA. Chest pain (46 percent) and dyspnea (18 percent) were the most common symptoms, with women more likely to have experienced dyspnea than chest pain (31 versus 24 percent). Patients with symptoms concerning for cardiac disease, particularly new or unstable symptoms, should seek prompt medical care for potentially life-saving evaluation and treatment.
