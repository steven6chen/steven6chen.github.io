The etiology of UPJ obstruction includes both congenital and acquired conditions. UPJ obstruction is the most common pathologic cause of antenatally detected hydronephrosis.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of congenital UPJ obstruction will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of UPJ obstruction is 1 in 500 live births screened by routine antenatal ultrasound; however, not all cases require surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. UPJ obstruction is the most common anatomical cause of antenatal hydronephrosis.</p><p>Boys are affected with UPJ obstruction more commonly than are girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Lesions are found more frequently on the left than on the right side. The reported rate of bilateral involvement is approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital UPJ obstruction is caused by anatomic lesions or functional disturbances that restrict urinary flow across the UPJ, resulting in hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55146 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77143 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most cases are thought to be due to partial obstruction, because complete obstruction results in rapid destruction of the kidney. In some cases, partial obstruction may also lead to progressive deterioration of renal function. However, in many infants, an equilibrium state may develop in which renal function remains stable.</p><p>Development of the equilibrium state resulting in stable renal function depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary rate and output</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomy and degree of UPJ obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compliance of the renal pelvis</p><p/><p>In the fetus and infant, the pelvis, because of its increased compliance, can stretch and thereby accommodate large volumes of urine, which results in pelvic dilatation (hydronephrosis). The large capacity volume of a stretched pelvis decreases the risk of high intrapelvic pressure. As a result, kidneys with a large intrarenal pelvis are less vulnerable to damage from obstruction than those with a small intrarenal pelvis, especially during diuresis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital UPJ obstruction is usually caused by intrinsic stenosis of the proximal ureter at that UPJ, and less commonly by extrinsic compression (accessory renal artery) of the UPJ.</p><p>Preoperative differentiation of intrinsic versus extrinsic obstruction is not necessary, since determination of the exact etiology can be made at the time of surgical correction and the technique of reconstruction remains the same regardless of UPJ etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic narrowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases of UPJ obstruction, the upper segment of the ureter is narrowed at the UPJ or kinked as the ureter enters the pelvis, resulting in obstruction of urinary flow. Although the underlying mechanism is not proven, it is thought that there is an embryologic disruption of the proximal ureter that alters circular musculature development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> collagen fibers, and composition between and around the muscular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Other causes of intrinsic UPJ obstruction, albeit rare, include valvular mucosal folds, persistent fetal ureteral convolutions, and ureteral polyps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91875\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91875 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrinsic compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 10 percent of pediatric UPJ obstruction, an aberrant or accessory renal artery or arterial branch may cross the lower pole of the kidney, resulting in compression of the UPJ and blockage of urinary flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80130\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80130 \">image 2</a>). It is possible to identify crossing vessels that cause extrinsic obstruction on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which are typically obtained for abdominal pain evaluation or other unrelated pathologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal and neonatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In geographic areas where maternal ultrasound screening is commonly performed, most cases of UPJ obstruction are diagnosed during the postnatal evaluation of antenatal hydronephrosis. The Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) developed criteria for the diagnosis and grading of antenatal hydronephrosis based upon the degree of pelvic dilatation, number of calyces seen, and the presence and severity of parenchymal atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68377 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50549 \">image 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of antenatal screening, newborns may present with a palpable abdominal mass caused by an enlarged obstructed kidney. Other presentations include urinary tract infection, hematuria, or failure to thrive. Renal failure is an unusual presentation, and occurs in infants with a single obstructed kidney or with bilateral involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Older children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations in older children include intermittent flank pain or abdominal pain (referred to as Dietl's crisis). The pain may worsen during brisk diuresis (for example, after consumption of caffeine or alcohol). These symptoms may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, leading to an evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Children may also present with renal injury after experiencing minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], hematuria, renal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], or hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. In these cases, an incidental finding of hydronephrosis on ultrasound may be the first clue of the possibility of UPJ obstruction as the underlying diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68377 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UPJ obstruction may be associated with other genitourinary anomalies, such as a horseshoe kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], or be a component of or associated with a syndrome such as CHARGE (coloboma, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, retardation, genital and ear anomalies) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of UPJ obstruction is generally suspected when imaging studies, typically ultrasonography, demonstrate hydronephrosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by diuretic renography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74670\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74670 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69172\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69172 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of UPJ obstruction present as a result of detecting hydronephrosis by prenatal ultrasonographic screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68377 \">image 3</a>). Although UPJ obstruction is the most common anatomical etiology of hydronephrosis, further imaging evaluation is required to differentiate UPJ obstruction from other frequent causes of antenatal hydronephrosis, such as transient and functional hydronephrosis, ureterovesical junction obstruction, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).</p><p>In older children with abdominal pain and suspected UPJ obstruction, an ultrasound examination should be performed during the acute painful episode (Dietl's crisis) to demonstrate hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80130\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80130 \">image 2</a>). When the pain subsides, the sonogram is frequently normal or only demonstrates mild dilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448856925\"><span class=\"h2\">Voiding cystourethrogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is performed in patients with hydronephrosis to confirm the presence or absence of VUR of both the affected and contralateral kidneys. Ten percent of patients with UPJ obstruction have contralateral low-grade vesicoureteral reflux. In addition, VCUG assesses the patency of the urethra in males to detect posterior urethral valves (PUV). Identification of VUR may be important because children with concurrent VUR and UPJ obstruction may be at higher risk for severe infection. The VCUG may be omitted in the work-up, especially in older children, since low grades of VUR are not considered clinically significant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and course of primary vesicoureteral reflux&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretic renography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretic renography (renal scan and the administration of a diuretic) is used to diagnose urinary tract obstruction. The preferred radioisotope is technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-99m MAG3), which is taken up by the renal cortex, filtered across the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) to the renal tubules, and excreted into the renal pelvis and urinary tract. The diuretic renography measures the drainage time from the renal pelvis (referred to as washout) and assesses total and each individual kidney's renal function. The washout measurement correlates with the degree of obstruction. In general, we use a half-life greater than 20 minutes to clear the isotope from the kidney as an indication of obstruction and need for surgical correction. Other urologists use the difference in split function (comparison of function between the two kidneys) to identify patients for surgery.</p><p>A more complete description of the diuretic renography is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal management of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Diuretic renography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomographic scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is an alternative to ultrasonography in the symptomatic child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50727\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50727 \">image 5</a>); however, it is not the preferred modality due to its radiation exposure. In UPJ obstruction, the CT scan typically shows hydronephrosis without a dilated ureter. CT scan may be initially performed in patients who present with acute abdominal pain of unknown etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47356493\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to diagnose UPJ type hydronephrosis. The advantage of MRI is the ability to discern accurate anatomy defining the point of obstruction. MRI can also determine the split function of the kidney and simulate the diuretic renogram by providing washout data. The disadvantage of MRI is the cost and the need for general anesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sedation in infants and small children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91874\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91874 \">image 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of UPJ obstruction includes other causes of hydronephrosis. Imaging studies (eg, diuretic renography, serial ultrasounds, and voiding cystourethrogram [VCUG]) differentiate UPJ obstruction from the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient hydronephrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional hydronephrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other urological anomalies including posterior urethral valves, congenital megaureter, ureterocele, and multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of evaluating a newborn with antenatal hydronephrosis is to identify all infants with significant renal or urinary tract abnormalities including UPJ obstruction, while limiting unnecessary radiographic studies in infants with clinically insignificant findings or normal infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal management of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p>Imaging studies are performed in a step-wise fashion. Decisions for further imaging depend upon the result of each study as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnatal ultrasound &ndash; Evaluation begins with a postnatal ultrasound to confirm the presence of persistent hydronephrosis. The timing of performing imaging studies evaluation is dependent upon whether there is bilateral involvement and the severity of antenatal hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69172\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69172 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74670\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74670 \">algorithm 1</a>). Infants with bilateral involvement or with a severe hydronephrotic solitary kidney require evaluation in the first few days of life because of the increased likelihood of significant disease and need for early intervention. In general, however, examination should be avoided in the first two days after birth, because hydronephrosis may not be detected because of extracellular fluid shifts that will underestimate the degree of hydronephrosis. Therefore, in unilateral disease regardless of severity, ultrasonography should be performed at least after 48 hours of life. We use the Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) system to grade the severity of hydronephrosis from grade 0 (no hydronephrosis) to grade IV (severe hydronephrosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50549 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) &ndash; If there is persistent, significant hydronephrosis, a VCUG is performed to detect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and in males, posterior urethral valves (PUV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal management of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the VCUG is negative (no reflux or PUV) and the infant has persistent postnatal severe hydronephrosis (renal pelvic diameter [RPD] &ge;15 mm), a diuretic renography is performed to detect possible obstruction. At this stage of evaluation, referral to a center with expertise in pediatric urologic care is warranted because the renal scan is an invasive procedure, requiring placement of an intravenous line and bladder catheter. In general, diuretic renography can be performed after six weeks of life because immediate surgical intervention is rarely required, and the diuretic renography is more difficult to interpret in the newborn period because of immature renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the VCUG is negative (no reflux or PUV) and the infant has persistent postnatal hydronephrosis that is not severe (RPD &lt;15 mm), a follow-up ultrasound is performed at three months of age to monitor the degree of hydronephrosis. If dilatation progresses to the threshold of RPD &ge;15 mm, a diuretic renography should be obtained at that time to determine the relative function of the affected kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Older child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography should be performed in older patients with symptoms that are suggestive of UPJ obstruction. The examination should be conducted when the child is symptomatic, as the obstruction may be intermittent. The diagnosis of intermittent UPJ obstruction is confirmed if hydronephrosis is present when the child is symptomatic, and resolves when the child is well. A diuretic renal scan will document baseline renal function and may also provoke symptoms during the diuretic phase of the study, which confirms the diagnosis. Surgery is indicated to prevent further episodes of symptoms (eg, pain). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that provide evidence for the optimal management of congenital UPJ obstruction. The following discussion is based upon observational studies, and the experience and opinions of experts in the field.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unilateral UPJ obstruction does not require prenatal intervention or early delivery, unless prenatal decompression of an enormously dilated renal pelvis is necessary to prevent dystocia or pulmonary compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. There is no evidence that prenatal intervention in infants with either a single obstructed kidney or bilateral involvement improves renal outcome. Antenatal surgery should only be considered in the rarest of cases and only in select centers with expertise after a complete evaluation is performed. The criteria and setting for antenatal surgery is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are symptomatic usually require operative intervention. If radiographic evaluation reveals hydronephrosis during pain, which resolves when symptoms subside, surgical intervention is warranted. These patients may have been initially evaluated with a computed tomography (CT) scan for an acute abdominal pain, which identifies the obstructed kidney. In our practice, we document the renal function in the obstructed and contralateral normal kidney with diuretic renogram. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic renography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomographic scan'</a> above.)</p><p>In symptomatic patients, pyeloplasty is performed and consists of resecting the atretic or stenotic segment, and reattaching the normal ureter to the renal pelvis, thereby relieving the obstruction. If the obstruction is due to an aberrant renal blood vessel, the UPJ is repositioned anatomically above the blood vessel preventing further obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H69596742\" class=\"local\">'Surgical options'</a> below.)</p><p>A follow-up ultrasound should be obtained approximately 4 to 12 weeks after surgery. Over time, nearly all patients (up to 95 percent) have radiographic improvement and resolution of their symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Pyelonephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with UPJ obstruction who present with acute pyelonephritis are treated with antibiotics. Surgical repair is performed when the infection has resolved. If pyelonephritis does not respond to antibiotics, a temporary percutaneous pyelostomy tube should be placed to relieve the obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney stones sometimes develop in the obstructed renal pelvis. Treatment involves open pyelolithotomy and pyeloplasty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ultimate goal of management is to preserve renal function and avoid unnecessary surgery. Managing asymptomatic patients is challenging, because the natural course of UPJ obstruction is variable. It appears that many patients will have stable renal function and improvement in the degree of hydronephrosis during long periods of observation. However, others will have deterioration of their renal function, and appear to benefit from surgical correction. As a result, there is no reliable method to predict whether the function of a kidney with UPJ obstruction will remain unaffected or deteriorate with time. In our center, we begin with watchful observation of patients with asymptomatic UPJ obstruction and reverse surgical intervention only when there is a deterioration in the patient's clinical status (ie, decrease in renal function or development of symptoms), increase in hydronephrosis, or parental preference. </p><p>This approach may prevent unnecessary surgery in some asymptomatic patients and is supported by findings from a large retrospective case series of 116 patients with grade III to IV hydronephrosis and obstructive diuretic renograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of the 116 patients, 83 presented with antenatal hydronephrosis. Management was divided into observation, immediate pyeloplasty, or pyeloplasty after observation. The choice of therapy was dependent upon ultrasound determination of the grade of hydronephrosis and degree of parenchymal thinning, and renal function on nuclear renal scan. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate pyeloplasty was performed in 32 children (28 percent) resulted in a pre- and postoperative change of average renal function (measured in 27 patients) from 30 to 39 percent and median grade of hydronephrosis from IV to III. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed pyeloplasty occurred in 47 patients (41 percent). Before and after pyeloplasty, relative renal function changed from 36 to 42 percent, and median grade of hydronephrosis from IV to III.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-seven patients were managed by only observation. In 29 patients, median hydronephrosis deceased from grade IV to 2.25 during an 18-month follow-up. In 15 patients, despite worsening hydronephrosis, repeat renal scans demonstrated stable renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical complications occurred in four patients (3 percent), including uncomplicated bowel injury, urine extravasation, persistent hematuria, and incisional abscess. These were all treated conservatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 33 symptomatic patients who presented postnatally, 29 underwent pyeloplasty. Of the 83 patients with antenatal presentation, 50 were surgically corrected.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that no one diagnostic study could determine when surgical intervention was needed. Their experience suggested that initial renal function based upon renal scan and serial ultrasonographic monitoring were the findings most commonly used in determining whether or not to perform pyeloplasty. In many patients, conservative management of observation alone had no adverse effect, and in some cases, demonstrated improvement.</p><p>Similar results were seen in a Belgium case series of 81 patients with antenatally diagnosed unilateral UPJ obstruction with an anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter (RPD) &ge;15 mm. In this cohort, early pyeloplasty was performed in eight patients (10 percent) based on evidence of differential renal function (DRF), and in one case parental choice, and late pyeloplasty in 23 patients (28 percent) who were initially managed conservatively because of evidence of deteriorating or persistently low DRF, increasing hydronephrosis, poor renal emptying, urinary tract infection, and one case each of nephrolithiasis and parental choice. Postoperative assessment in 28 of the 31 patients showed improved, stable, or poorer DRF in 7, 19 and 2 patients, respectively.

This threshold value indicates that the narrowing of the UPJ and delayed drainage is not impairing renal function.</p><p>In these patients, serial renal ultrasounds are obtained to monitor any change in the degree of hydronephrosis that indicate changes in functional obstruction. Renal ultrasound examinations are performed every four months until the child reaches one year of age, every six months for the next two years, and then annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130566607\"><span class=\"h4\">Diuretic renography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the renal sonogram shows increasing hydronephrosis, diuretic renography is repeated to confirm that renal function is stable. Surgical correction is recommended if renography shows the affected kidney has a functional deterioration of &gt;10 percent, or has reached a threshold of less than 40 percent of split renal function. One study also suggested that delayed washout time (transit time of tracer from the renal pelvis) as an indicator for surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic renography'</a> above.)</p><p>Of note, relative renal function may not be a reliable measure in patients with bilateral involvement. In patients with bilateral disease, glomerular filtration rate can be measured with serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by renal scan.

The mean age at the time of UTI was 6.1 months. All four patients with UTI presented with fever, and one developed urosepsis.

Ultrasound examination is repeated approximately four to six weeks after surgery. If the hydronephrosis does not improve, a diuretic renogram should be performed to assess for persistent obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a loss of renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic and robotic pyeloplasty &ndash; Laparoscopic pyeloplasty in infants and children is performed in some centers, with excellent short-term results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-34</a>]. Robotic pyeloplasty also is becoming routinely used both in children and infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115084\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef115084 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. In general, laparoscopic and robotic techniques are performed transperitoneal in contrast to retroperitoneal for open pyeloplasty. Laparoscopic and robotic techniques also typically require postoperative placement of internal stents, increasing the economic burden of pyeloplasty, that are subsequently removed under general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The use of balloon dilation using retrograde pyeloplasty has also been reported in patients who are less than 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others &ndash; Alternative surgical techniques, such as percutaneous and retrograde endopyelotomy, have been used in adults.

Failure rates were similar for both open and laparoscopic procedures. Reintervention was performed in 27 cases for worsening hydronephrosis (n = 16), pain (n = 7), urosepsis (n = 2), and other causes (n = 2). Five patients required three additional procedures, and 14 had two reinterventions. The mean time to first reintervention was 19.3 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study based on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of 6006 children with UPJ obstruction who underwent surgical repair, approximately 17 percent of the cases were performed by minimally invasive pyeloplasty (MIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There was no in-hospital morality overall. The lowest rate of complications was observed in patients with open pyeloplasty (OP) at centers that performed OP at a high volume (5.7 percent). Similar higher rates were noted in children who underwent MIP at either a high volume (11.7 percent) or low volume center (10.4 percent), and the highest complication rate was seen in children with OP at a center with low volume (16 percent). Groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, race, comorbidity, insurance status, and median household income. A multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for these variables demonstrated postoperative complication rates were similar for patients with either OP or MIP at centers with high volume, but complications were higher at centers with low volume for both MIP and OP. Overall, MIP was associated with a shorter hospital stay than OP.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon our clinical experience, observation is appropriate for asymptomatic patients with UPJ-type hydronephrosis that is mild to moderate in severity (ie, Society of Fetal Urology [SFU] grade II to III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50549 \">image 4</a>). We follow these patients with ultrasound examination every four (grade III) to six (grade II) months in the first year of life, then every 12 to 18 months thereafter. If there is an increase in the degree of hydronephrosis, diuretic renography is performed. If the affected kidney has less than 40 percent of split renal function, or there is a serial loss greater than 10 percent from a previous study, surgical intervention is recommended.</p><p>Newborns who have persistent SFU grade IV hydronephrosis require closer observation. In these patients, we obtain a diuretic renogram at six to eight weeks of age. If the hydronephrotic kidney has decreased renal function (less than 40 percent of split renal function) compared with its normal contralateral mate, we recommend surgical intervention. More commonly, the hydronephrotic kidney will have equal function compared with the normal contralateral kidney. In this case, we repeat a sonogram in four to six weeks. If the sonogram shows improvement, we continue to follow with serial ultrasounds at three to four month intervals. If we see any worsening of the hydronephrosis, we repeat a diuretic renogram. These serial sonograms usually show continued SFU grade IV hydronephrosis without substantial change from previous studies. In this case, we offer the family either continued observation, which will require ongoing monitoring with sonograms and possible diuretic renography, or surgical intervention.</p><p>Of note, in our practice, the washout curve or half-life calculation is not typically used to determine the need for surgery in any of these patients; however, others use a delay in excretion indicative of obstruction and renal function in considering surgical correction. The relative renal function typically does not change if the initial and follow-up renograms demonstrate stable renal function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3022656624\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical intervention is performed for the following indications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms including pain, infection, and renal stones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing grade of hydronephrosis, and decrease in function of the affected kidney so that it is less than the threshold of 40 percent of split renal function, or there is a serial loss greater than 10 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parental <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient preference to avoid continued invasive testing, and allow definitive correction of the problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive hydronephrosis with an RPD &gt;50 mm.</p><p/><p>This approach appears to limit surgical correction to one-half of patients diagnosed with antenatal UPJ obstruction.

In this cohort of patients, 235 patients had initial relative renal function (RRF) &gt;40 percent, 68 had RRF between 30 and 40 percent, and 40 had RRF &lt;40 percent.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the etiology of UPJ obstruction includes both congenital and acquired conditions, congenital causes are more common. UPJ obstruction is the most common pathologic cause of antenatally detected hydronephrosis with a reported incidence of up to 1 in 500 fetuses screened by antenatal ultrasound. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital UPJ obstruction is usually caused by intrinsic stenosis of the proximal ureter, less commonly by extrinsic compression of the UPJ by an aberrant or accessory renal artery or arterial branch, and rarely from an intraluminal fold or ureteral polyp. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of UPJ obstruction are diagnosed during the postnatal evaluation of antenatal hydronephrosis. In the absence of antenatal screening, infants may present with an abdominal mass (enlarged obstructed kidney), urinary tract infection (UTI), hematuria, or failure to thrive. In older children, the most common clinical manifestations of UPJ obstruction are intermittent flank and abdominal pain. Other symptoms include renal injury after experiencing minor trauma, hematuria, renal calculi, or rarely hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of UPJ obstruction is generally suspected when imaging studies, usually ultrasonography, demonstrate hydronephrosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by diuretic renography. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies (eg, diuretic renography, serial ultrasounds, and voiding cystourethrogram [VCUG]) differentiate UPJ from other causes of hydronephrosis, including vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), transient and functional hydronephrosis, and other urological anomalies (eg, posterior urethral valves [PUV], congenital megaureter, ureterocele, and multicystic dysplastic kidney [MCDK]). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with suspected UPJ obstruction includes ultrasonography to demonstrate persistent hydronephrosis, VCUG to detect the presence or absence of VUR, and a diuretic renogram that demonstrates the delay in isotope clearance at the UPJ confirming partial or total blockage of urinary flow. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials that provide evidence for the optimal management of congenital UPJ obstruction. The following management regimen is based upon observational studies, and the experience and opinions of the author.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> to perform prenatal intervention or early delivery in fetuses with unilateral UPJ obstruction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In extremely rare cases, decompression of an enormously dilated renal pelvis may be considered to prevent dystocia or fetal pulmonary compression. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In symptomatic patients, we recommend surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction and resolve symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

Indications for surgical intervention include increasing hydronephrosis and decrease in split renal function below 40 percent or a serial loss greater than 10 percent in subsequent studies, the development of symptoms, massive hydronephrosis with a renal pelvic diameter (RPD) greater than 50 mm, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parental and patient preference. This approach limits surgical correction to approximately half of affected children. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited long-term data confined to children who underwent surgical correction demonstrate a correction of the obstruction defined by stable or improved renal function, decreased hydronephrosis, and lack of symptoms in most patients. The rate of recurrent obstruction requiring additional intervention is approximately 5 percent. Long-term data on patients who were managed by observation alone are not available.
