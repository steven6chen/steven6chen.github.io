It is used to treat partial and generalized seizures and acute mania, and as prophylaxis for bipolar disorder and migraine headaches. Although acute VPA intoxication frequently results in mild, self-limited central nervous system depression, serious toxicity and death may occur.</p><p>The clinical features and treatment of VPA intoxication are reviewed here. A summary table to facilitate the emergency management of VPA overdose is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74180\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74180 \">table 1</a>).

Delayed and extended release products are typically formulated as divalproex sodium. Therapeutic daily doses range from 500 mg to 2 g in adults or 15 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Nonenteric-coated preparations of VPA are rapidly and nearly completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; peak plasma concentrations are observed from one to four hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Peak plasma concentrations occur four to five hours after therapeutic doses of enteric-coated tablets but may be markedly delayed following overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A multicenter study of VPA ingestions revealed a mean time to peak plasma concentration of 7.4&plusmn;3.9 hours; 14 percent of patients had peak concentrations delayed greater than 10 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one case report, peak plasma VPA concentrations occurred 17 hours following overdose of divalproex sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Therapeutic serum concentrations typically range from 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (350 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. At therapeutic concentrations, VPA is 80 to 90 percent bound to plasma proteins and has a small volume of distribution (0.13 to 0.23 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>].</p><p>VPA is metabolized extensively by the liver via glucuronic acid conjugation and beta and omega oxidation to produce multiple metabolites, some of which are biologically active. Less than 3 percent of VPA is excreted unchanged in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. VPA is eliminated by first-order kinetics with a half-life ranging from 5 to 20 hours (mean 11 hours); the half-life may be prolonged to as great as 30 hours after overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>].</p><p>CYP (p450) mediated omega oxidation, which is normally responsible for a small component of VPA metabolism, may generate toxic metabolites that have been implicated in the dose-related and idiosyncratic hepatic, metabolic, and neurologic adverse effects of VPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].

Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction is the most common manifestation of toxicity, ranging in severity from mild drowsiness to coma or fatal cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>].

Although free and total VPA concentrations do not correlate precisely with severity of clinical effects, patients who ingest greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of VPA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have serum concentrations greater than 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (1260 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> usually develop some degree of CNS depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].

When associated with acute intoxication, cerebral edema becomes clinically apparent 12 hours to four days after overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/8,10,11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11,21</a>]. Cerebral edema from VPA toxicity may result in early herniation and ischemia with focal neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cerebral edema likely reflects abnormal VPA metabolism that allows accumulation of the 2-EN-VPA metabolite in the brain and plasma. 2-EN-VPA has a prolonged elimination half-life (mean half-life 43 hours) and may be responsible for the prolonged coma exhibited by some patients despite normalization of plasma VPA concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperammonemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valproic-acid associated hyperammonemia is typically defined as a plasma ammonia concentration greater than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (47 <span class=\"nowrap\">&mu;mol/L)</span>. Hyperammonemia may occur after acute overdose or chronic use of VPA, and is not always accompanied by abnormal liver function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/6-9,14,15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,14,15,23</a>]. In addition, valproic&ndash;acid associated hyperammonemia does not necessarily result in clinical encephalopathy, and in half the cases is asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of valproate-induced hyperammonemia in&nbsp;the general population of patients taking VPA&nbsp;is not well established, but it is likely higher in those&nbsp;who come to the attention of health care facilities.&nbsp;Cross-sectional studies have suggested a prevalence for this condition of 16 to 100 percent, while prospective studies have reported a prevalence of 70 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a review of 14 cases in a psychiatric setting, the mean increase in ammonia concentration was 3.6 times the maximal normal value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Hyperammonemia is believed due to propionic acid, a metabolite of VPA, which inhibits mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, an enzyme necessary for ammonia elimination via the urea cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the action of this enzyme is sufficiently impaired, ammonia levels will accumulate, frequently producing encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, VPA may raise plasma ammonia levels through interaction with carnitine, a cofactor necessary for mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid metabolism. In states of relative carnitine deficiency, metabolism of VPA via omega oxidation increases; omega oxidation products also inhibit carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Plasma ammonia concentrations directly correlate with the dose and serum concentrations of VPA, and inversely with serum concentrations of carnitine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/12,23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Valproate-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic hyperammonemia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> therapy is often referred to as &quot;VHE,&quot; and can sometimes occur without abnormalities of liver function tests.

Chronic dosing of VPA is also associated with mild aminotransferase elevations in up to 44 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/13,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,41,42</a>]. Discontinuation of the drug usually results in complete resolution of these liver function abnormalities, although idiosyncratic fulminant hepatic failure and death (with histopathologic changes similar to those of Reye syndrome) have also occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/13,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,43,44</a>]. The rates of both non-fatal and fatal hepatic failure appear to be higher when valproic acid is administered with another medication (most often antiepileptics or benzodiazepines) as opposed to monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Patients at greatest risk for fatal hepatotoxicity due to chronic VPA are children less than two years old, particularly those with organic brain disease, developmental delay, congenital metabolic disorders, and severe epilepsy treated with multiple anticonvulsants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Liver transplant in children with valproic acid-associated acute hepatic failure results in significantly decreased survival rates compared to liver transplant in children with drug-induced acute liver failure unrelated to valproic acid. This may be due to the &quot;unmasking&quot; of mitochondrial disease by VPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Patients with unsuspected mitochondrial disease (eg, Alpers-Huttenlocher disease) are particularly at risk for hepatotoxicity from VPA. The presence of an underlying mitochondrial disorder alters clinical management and should be considered in children (and adults) presenting with VPA hepatotoxicity.

VPA (itself a short-chain fatty acid) combines with carnitine and results in carnitine depletion during long-term or high-dose VPA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/12,23,28,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23,28,47</a>]. Hypocarnitinemia results both in impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation for energy production and impaired VPA metabolism. Microvesicular steatosis and subsequent hepatic failure can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. VPA-induced lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion may also contribute to hepatotoxicity through less well understood mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrolyte abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common metabolic abnormalities after VPA overdose include hypernatremia, hyperosmolality, hypocalcemia, and anion gap metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/7,8,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11,15</a>]. VPA is administered as a sodium salt (13.8 mg sodium per 100 mg VPA) and therefore can produce hypernatremia in large doses. VPA and its metabolites are low molecular weight, osmotically-active acids and anions that may produce elevated osmolal and anion gaps and metabolic acidosis. Hypocalcemia develops when calcium binds anionic VPA metabolites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7533916\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Valproic acid concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic serum concentrations of valproic acid (VPA) range from 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (350 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Serum concentrations should be measured in any case of known or suspected overdose or toxicity. Because valproic acid levels often peak several hours after ingestion, we recommend that serial valproic acid concentrations be assessed every two to four hours until a steady decline in the level is noted, which suggests that a peak serum level has been reached. Patients with serum concentrations greater than 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (1260 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> usually develop some degree of central nervous system (CNS) depression, although free and total VPA concentrations correlate imprecisely with the severity of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7534804\"><span class=\"h2\">General testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory evaluation of the poisoned patient should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingerstick glucose, to rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of any alteration in mental status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, to rule out these common coingestions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (ECG), to rule out conduction system impairment by drugs that prolong the QRS or QTc intervals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age</p><p/><p>In addition, the following tests should be obtained for any patient at risk for significant VPA toxicity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic serum electrolyte concentrations, paying particular attention to sodium (concern for hypernatremia), bicarbonate (concern for acidemia), and calcium (concern for hypocalcemia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum transaminase concentrations (AST, ALT)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma ammonia concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet concentration</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5498341\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valproic acid (VPA) overdose often causes a depressed mental status, but may also lead to cerebral edema in some cases, generally 12 hours to four days after acute intoxication. Thus, clinicians may need to obtain a head CT in some patients with VPA poisoning to assess for cerebral edema. No guidelines can address all clinical scenarios, and physicians should obtain a head CT if they suspect the development of cerebral edema based upon clinical findings. </p><p>We suggest obtaining a head CT in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with VPA toxicity and focal neurologic deficits (ie, not simply a mildly depressed mental status)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with VPA toxicity, depressed mental status, and an elevated plasma ammonia concentration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a depressed mental status 12 hours or longer after an acute VPA overdose</p><p/><p>A head CT is generally not necessary during the first few hours after an acute VPA ingestion in patients with a mildly depressed mental status and a normal plasma ammonia concentration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24120007\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute valproic acid (VPA) poisoning is suspected on the basis of a history of overdose associated with typical physical findings, primarily central nervous system depression, which can range from mild cognitive impairment to coma. Other findings can include vital sign abnormalities (respiratory depression, hypotension, tachycardia, hyperthermia), gastrointestinal complaints (eg, vomiting), and other neurologic findings (miosis, agitation, tremors, myoclonus). Chronic toxicity may be associated with non-dose-related (idiosyncratic) toxicity, including hepatic failure, hyperammonemia without hepatic failure, pancreatitis, or myelodysplastic changes. Elevations in blood ammonia and aminotransferase concentrations are suggestive of either acute or chronic toxicity. The diagnosis is confirmed by an elevated serum concentration of VPA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24120015\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most salient feature of valproic acid (VPA) toxicity is a depressed mental status. Therefore, the potential differential diagnosis for VPA poisoning is extremely broad and includes intracerebral hemorrhage, infections of the central nervous system (meningitis, encephalitis), metabolic derangements (eg, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia), as well as other poisonings (eg, sedative-hypnotics, anti-epileptics). The diagnosis of VPA poisoning is suspected on the basis of the history and suggestive clinical findings (eg, elevated serum transaminase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasma ammonia concentrations), and confirmed by the presence of an elevated serum VPA concentration, which distinguishes the diagnosis from alternatives. Common causes of altered mental status, such as hypoglycemia and hyponatremia, should be ruled out during the initial evaluation using bedside and basic laboratory tests. The differential diagnosis of depressed mental status is reviewed in greater detail separately.

Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> and carnitine may be beneficial.

While the efficacy of naloxone is questionable, the risks associated with treatment are low and thus we suggest that naloxone be given to patients with acute VPA poisoning and signs of central nervous system depression (depressed mental status), <strong>UNLESS</strong> the patient is known or suspected to be habituated to opioids but acute opioid intoxication is not suspected. In such patients we recommend withholding naloxone so as to not precipitate acute opioid withdrawal.</p><p>We suggest starting with a dose of 0.04 mg IV. This dose is titrated upwards every few minutes until the patient responds (improved mental status) or a maximum single dose of 2 mg IV is reached. Once a 2 mg dose has been reached, additional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>, given in 2 mg increments, may be given up to a total cumulative dose of 10 mg. If there is no patient response after a total of 10 mg IV, no further naloxone should be given.

In the absence of robust data, it is reasonable to give carnitine supplementation to patients with VPA toxicity and any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hepatoxicity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valproic acid serum concentration &gt;450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> (&gt;3120 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Valproic acid concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valproic-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Valproate-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Carnitine supplementation may also be given to patients with asymptomatic hyperammonemia, particularly in the setting of significant VPA toxicity.</p><p>There are no controlled studies evaluating the optimal dose of carnitine supplementation in the setting of valproic acid toxicity. Based upon the available literature, a reasonable approach to L-carnitine dosing is 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV over 30 minutes (maximum dose 6 g), followed by 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV (maximum dose 3 g) given every eight hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. &#160; </p><p>A number of case reports describe various doses for carnitine, ranging from 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV for the loading dose, to 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV for the daily dose thereafter, but no approach has been shown to be more efficacious than that described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. </p><p>Treatment with carnitine is continued until the clinical signs of severe poisoning resolve. For patients with an acute overdose of VPA but no clinical or laboratory signs of toxicity, oral carnitine can be administered prophylactically at a dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (up to 3 g total) divided every six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Oral carnitine administration reverses carnitine deficiency, leads to resolution of elevated ammonia levels, and improves lethargy in patients treated chronically with VPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/23,28,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,60,61</a>]. In addition, carnitine may hasten the resolution of coma, prevent hepatic dysfunction, and reverse mitochondrial metabolic abnormalities in patients with acute VPA intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/12,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,62</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study of patients with severe valproate-induced hepatotoxicity noted that intravenous carnitine therapy was associated with a marked increase in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Furthermore, a retrospective review of all published English language articles from 1948 to 2011 related to carnitine therapy for VHE revealed no significant adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Although theoretical concern exists for the potential development of seizures with carnitine supplementation, another systematic review found no evidence of increased risk with carnitine supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Nevertheless, published evidence supporting the use of carnitine consists solely of observational studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal decontamination and other enhanced elimination techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single dose activated charcoal (AC) alone is sufficient for the vast majority of patients with a VPA overdose; we suggest this treatment for all patients with suspected VPA poisoning who present within two hours of an acute ingestion. The standard dose is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (maximum dose 50 g). AC should be withheld in patients who are sedated and may not be able to protect their airway, unless tracheal intubation is performed first. However, tracheal intubation should <strong>not</strong> be performed solely for the purpose of giving charcoal. AC should also be withheld in patients who refuse to ingest it willingly; a nasogastric tube should not be placed to administer AC in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not recommend the routine use of multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) in patients with VPA poisoning. In the past, MDAC was given to patients who had ingested enteric-coated, delayed-release preparations in order to prevent on-going absorption, which may occur with such ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/4,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,54</a>], and to patients who had ingested a large amount of VPA. However, we do not believe the medical literature has established that the potential benefits of this therapy, even in the two aforementioned clinical scenarios, outweigh the risks of pulmonary aspiration and bowel obstruction. In volunteer studies, MDAC was not shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of VPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The authors of a systematic review of the literature concur and do not recommend the use of MDAC for valproic acid toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Orogastric lavage is <strong>not</strong> routinely recommended because the morbidity from this procedure outweighs its theoretic advantages over activated charcoal alone. </p><p>We do not recommend the routine use of whole bowel irrigation (WBI) in patients with VPA poisoning. WBI has not demonstrated clinical benefit in such cases. In patients who have rising VPA plasma concentrations and clinical deterioration despite appropriate treatment, clinicians should make use of more definitive therapies, such as hemodialysis or hemoperfusion. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Because little excretion of VPA occurs at the kidney, forced diuresis (with or without manipulation of urinary pH) is ineffective for increasing drug elimination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no controlled studies that confirm the benefits of extracorporeal removal of VPA in overdose patients, the relatively low molecular weight (144 daltons) and low volume of distribution of VPA suggest a potential benefit from such therapy, and numerous case reports suggest that extracorporeal removal is effective in particular clinical circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>We concur with the approach published by the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) workgroup about the clinical circumstances when extracorporeal removal is most likely to be effective in patients with VPA poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These guidelines are based upon a systematic review of 79 articles &ndash; largely case studies and case series &ndash; involving extracorporeal removal in this setting. We use the following indications for extracorporeal removal, which are slightly modified from the EXTRIP guidelines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal treatment is suggested for severe VPA poisoning, including the presence of any of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>VPA concentration &gt;1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (&gt;9000 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebral edema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shock</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal treatment may be effective and is reasonable to perform in the following circumstances:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>VPA concentration &gt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (&gt;6250 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coma or respiratory depression requiring mechanical ventilation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>pH &lt;7.10</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy </p><p/><p>Intermittent hemodialysis is the preferred extracorporeal elimination technique, although intermittent hemoperfusion or continuous renal replacement therapy are acceptable alternatives if hemodialysis is unavailable. Extracorporeal treatment can be discontinued with evidence of clinical improvement or when a serum VPA concentrations between 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (350 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> is achieved. Signs of improvement might include extubation, improved mental status, normalizing hemodynamic status, resolving electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities.</p><p>Hemodialysis has little impact on the overall elimination of VPA at therapeutic serum concentrations because the high degree of protein binding limits the amount of free drug available for diffusion across the dialysis membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, the efficacy of hemodialysis for eliminating VPA increases in overdose. At serum concentrations above 90 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> protein-binding sites become saturated and there is a progressive elevation in the concentration of free drug, which can be readily cleared across a dialysis membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Hemodialysis has the added benefit of reversing VPA-associated severe metabolic abnormalities, including elevated ammonia concentrations. As VPA is metabolized primarily by the liver and is highly protein-bound, baseline renal function is not an important consideration when determining the need for hemodialysis during overdose.</p><p>There are a number of reports describing the use of hemodialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemoperfusion in the treatment of VPA overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/4,15,47,66,70-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,47,66,70-78</a>]. Alone or in combination, these modalities appear to enhance the plasma clearance and decrease the elimination half-life of VPA substantially. Plasma VPA clearances range from approximately 50 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> with extracorporeal methods, as compared with an intrinsic clearance that ranges from approximately 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Elimination half-lives ranged from 1.7 to 3 hours during extracorporeal methods as compared with 4.8 to 21 hours in these patients before and after extracorporeal removal. In one series, accelerated clinical recovery (resolution of coma, hypotension, or the need for pressor support) was described in five of eight patients during extracorporeal treatment. Although a slight increase in clearance was noted with charcoal hemoperfusion cartridge when compared with hemodialysis, this involved older less efficient hemodialysis modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. There are several case reports of continuous renal replacement therapy to treat VPA toxicity, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/75,76,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76,78</a>], but these modalities do not appear as effective as traditional hemodialysis in increasing VPA clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7534834\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patients at greatest risk for fatal <span class=\"nowrap\">hepatotoxicity/Reye-like</span> syndrome due to chronic valproic acid (VPA) toxicity are children less than two years old, particularly those with organic brain disease, developmental delay, congenital metabolic disorders, and severe epilepsy treated with multiple anticonvulsants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valproic-acid-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other clinical findings following overdose can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vital signs &ndash; Respiratory depression, hypotension, tachycardia, hyperthermia </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic &ndash; Hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmolality, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte abnormalities'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal &ndash; Vomiting, diarrhea, hepatitis (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hepatotoxicity'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additional neurologic &ndash; Miosis, agitation, tremors, myoclonus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperammonemia may occur after acute overdose or chronic use of VPA. It may be symptomatic (ie, associated with some degree of encephalopathy) or not, and is not always accompanied by abnormal liver function tests. Hepatotoxicity too may develop with acute ingestion or chronic use. In addition, chronic VPA therapy may be associated with non-dose-related toxicity, including hepatic failure, pancreatitis, alopecia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or myelodysplasia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hyperammonemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Valproate-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hepatotoxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7532864\" class=\"local\">'General findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with VPA poisoning may develop cerebral edema; a head CT is often needed if cerebral edema is suspected based upon clinical findings. Guidance about obtaining a CT is provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5498341\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic serum concentrations of VPA range from 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (350 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span>. Serum concentrations should be measured in any case of known or suspected overdose or toxicity. Because VPA levels often peak several hours after ingestion, we recommend that serial VPA concentrations be assessed every two to four hours until a steady, significant decline is noted. Plasma ammonia concentrations should be monitored if VHE is suspected clinically. Common metabolic abnormalities after VPA overdose include hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H7533916\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care is the principal treatment for VPA intoxication and results in good outcomes in the vast majority of patients. A summary table to facilitate the emergency management of VPA overdose is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74180\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74180 \">table 1</a>). Patients with significant alterations in mental status are likely to require tracheal intubation. Seizures are treated initially with benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 2 mg IV; dose can be repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary for refractory seizures). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest treatment with a single dose of activated charcoal for patients who present within two hours of a VPA overdose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The standard dose is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (50 g maximum). Activated charcoal (AC) should be withheld in patients who are sedated and may not be able to protect their airway. We do not suggest treatment with multiple dose activated charcoal or whole bowel irrigation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination and other enhanced elimination techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> and L-carnitine may be beneficial in some cases. We suggest the administration of naloxone to patients with VPA toxicity and a depressed mental status, provided they are not at risk for acute opioid withdrawal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dosing directions are provided in the text. We suggest an initial dose of L-carnitine (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV loading dose; maximum dose 6 g) for patients with VPA toxicity associated with hyperammonemia, lethargy, coma, or hepatic dysfunction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7533050\" class=\"local\">'Naloxone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Carnitine supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend consultation with a nephrologist for extracorporeal treatment for all patients with clinically severe VPA poisoning. Indications for hemodialysis include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>VPA concentration &gt;1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (&gt;9000 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebral edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shock</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hemodialysis is reasonable to perform in the following circumstances: coma, VPA concentration &gt;900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (&gt;6250 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L);</span> coma or respiratory depression requiring mechanical ventilation; pH &lt;7.10; and, acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy.
