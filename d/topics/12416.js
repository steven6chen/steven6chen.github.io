All major cultures, including Native American, European, South American, Asian, and African cultures, have used botanicals for healing purposes. As an example, saw palmetto was used for urinary symptoms in men from Egypt in the 15<sup>th</sup> century BCE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hippocrates documented the use of St. John's wort for mood ailments in the 5<sup>th</sup> century BCE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Inner Classic of the Yellow Emperor around 100 BCE describes complex traditional Chinese herbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Herbal medicines flourished in Europe in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, then showed a decline with the Scientific Revolution. European immigrants brought to North America their own herbal medicine traditions as well as acquiring many from Native Americans. Two-thirds of entries in the first edition of the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) published in 1820 were botanical substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After about 1920, standardized pharmaceutical drugs increasingly replaced herbal therapies in the United States. Synthetic drugs were found to have larger pharmacologic effects and greater profitability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Over 120 conventionally used pharmaceuticals are derived from plant species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54757 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p>In the United States, in response to increased public interest and use of complementary and alternative medicines, Congress established the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) in 1992. The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements was created in 1994 to conduct and coordinate research in herbs and supplements. In 1998, the NIH OAM was upgraded to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). NCCIH has prioritized evaluating mechanisms, efficacy, and safety of botanical medicines through basic science studies, clinical research, and the establishment of dedicated botanical research centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A list of commonly used herbs and supplements is provided below with links to more information about use, efficacy, and safety elsewhere in UpToDate and from the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) websites. General concerns about quality and safety are reviewed below.

A 1990 national telephone survey of complementary and alternative medicine use by United States adults demonstrated that 2.5 percent of respondents used herbal medicines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A follow-up 1997 national survey showed almost a fivefold increase, with 12.1 percent of United States adults reporting herbal medicine use in the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>One factor contributing to this dramatic increase was congressional passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) in 1994.

Obtaining accurate market data that capture all of United States herbal sales is difficult. This is due in part to the multiple channels available for purchasing supplements such as drug stores, supermarkets, warehouse buying clubs, natural food stores, multilevel marketing, health professionals, and the Internet. Nonetheless, using multiple survey methods, total sales of herbal and dietary supplements in the United States were estimated to be USD $6.9 billion for 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Reasons for use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Americans reported that their top reasons for using herbs and supplements were enhancing health and helping with common chronic symptoms or diseases such as memory loss, arthritis, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this way, herbs are similar to other complementary and alternative medicines in that they are frequently used for chronic conditions for which conventional medicine does not offer straightforward answers or cures.</p><p>Herbs are also appealing to those who perceive nature as benevolent and healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Associated with this is the mistaken perception that a naturally derived product is always safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, medicinal herbs were included in the United States National Formulary and the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). In 1962, outrage over limb defects from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> prompted Congress to pass the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendment. This required proof of safety and efficacy for all prescription and over-the-counter drugs and reassigned herbal medicines to the category of food supplements which have a lower threshold of required evidence for safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In the early 1990s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) attempted to develop more strict regulations for herbal products. This was opposed in a campaign by consumers, supplement manufacturers, and political advocates. The result was a 1994 bill passed by Congress called the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). DSHEA defined dietary supplements as a product containing one or more of the following: a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb, other botanical, concentrate, metabolite, constituent, or extract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. DSHEA placed dietary supplements in a distinct category from drugs. Labels of dietary supplements are required to state: &quot;this product in not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.&quot; However, product labels are allowed to make health claims, such as &quot;promotes prostate health&quot; or &quot;supports the circulatory system.&quot;</p><p>Importantly, makers of dietary supplements are not required to prove efficacy, safety, or quality of a product prior to marketing. Supplement manufacturers are also not obligated to report postmarketing adverse events to the FDA. DSHEA therefore moved the burden of proving that a product is unsafe or ineffective to the FDA. For various reasons, the FDA has infrequently removed a dietary supplement product from marketing. Products containing ephedra, androstenedione, and PC-SPES are notable exceptions.</p><p>Increasing research, case reports, and publicity of adverse effects and harmful drug-herb interactions have prompted many clinicians, physician organizations such as the National Academy of Medicine, and consumer groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest to call for reform of DSHEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. National surveys found that 81 percent of Americans believed evidence of safety should be required before allowing the sale of a supplement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, more than half did not understand that current regulations did not require such evidence. Thus, the public appears to be sensitive to safety issues and supportive of greater regulation.</p><p>In 2007, the FDA issued new rules requiring Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for dietary supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The new GMPs require dietary supplements be properly labeled, free of adulterants, and manufactured according to specified standards for personnel and equipment. However, the rules allow manufacturers, in particular smaller companies, significant flexibility to specify the quality criteria they will follow. As an example, there are no specified maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for heavy metals such as lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There is concern whether the GMPs are being uniformly followed. Since 2010, 71 percent of 626 FDA inspections of supplement manufacturers resulted in citations for not following the new standards; on average, each company was cited for seven deviations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, one study found that many supplements recalled due to adulteration with pharmaceutical ingredients were still available for purchase six months after the recall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERNATIONAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herbs are commonly used for medicinal purposes throughout the world.

Herbal formulations are often prepared individually for the patient from raw plant materials, instead of being commercially available.</p><p>In many developing countries, the administering of traditional medicines is often part of an elaborate healing ritual with spiritual or supernatural components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, regulation of the quality of herbal products is significantly greater in the European Union than in the United States. A 2004 EU directive requires manufacturers of all over-the-counter herbal products to register and license the product with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. A premarket evaluation of quality and safety of the product is required. Companies need to carry out post-marketing surveillance and report serious adverse events. Indications for these over-the-counter herbal products are for minor conditions not usually requiring a clinician's care. Instead of requiring new rigorous efficacy studies to market a new product, documentation from the medical literature of safety for the relevant condition and reasonable plausibility of efficacy is needed. In countries such as Germany and France herbal medicines are partially or fully reimbursed.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a Traditional Medicine Strategy &quot;to promote the integration of traditional medicine and CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) into national health care systems where appropriate&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As part of this effort, the WHO distributed a survey about national policies and regulations for herbal medicines to help frame regulatory policies, enhance quality, safety and efficacy, ensure access, and support rational use of these remedies; 141 of 191 member states from all WHO regions responded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thirty-seven percent of responding nations had herbal medicine regulations in place. Approximately half of the remaining nations were considering implementing regulations. Over two-thirds of countries sold herbal medicines without requiring a prescription. There are relatively few herbal medicines available by prescription only (eg, saw palmetto, ginkgo, St. John's wort).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY AND EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the regulatory structure for herbal medicines, there is substantial variation in the quality of commercially available products in the United States and elsewhere.

Often it is unclear which of these chemicals play an important role in the herb's pharmacologic activity. Some herbal products are standardized to contain a specified amount of one or two chemicals or chemical groups thought to be the active ingredients for the herb. Examples include ginkgo extracts standardized to 24 percent flavonoid glycosides and 6 percent terpenoids, and St. John's wort standardized to 0.3 percent hypericin. The latter is an example of a product standardized to a component that many experts believe is not the most important component for antidepressant activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

Of complementary alternative medicine users who did not disclose such use to their clinicians, 46 percent reported that a reason for not telling their clinician was &quot;it wasn't important for my doctor to know&quot; and 57 percent also reported that &quot;the doctor never asked.&quot;</p><p>There are several important reasons for asking patients about the use of herbal medicines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herbs are pharmacologically active and therefore can positively and negatively impact patient health. Positive effects may include improvement of disease-specific outcomes. Negative effects may include adverse effects and drug-herb interactions. For these reasons, the Joint Commission in the United States now requires that herb and supplement use be recorded as part of the medication list in the hospital medical record [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussion of herbal medicine use may open dialogue about patient concerns that may be amenable to management with well-studied conventional therapies. For example, further questioning of a patient who uses multiple supplements such as garlic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin E</a>, and Coenzyme Q-10 might reveal anxiety of myocardial infarction due to a family history of premature heart disease. Measuring cardiovascular risk markers and educating the patient about conventional cardiac risk factor reduction and therapy could then be initiated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers may need to consider herb-drug interactions when prescribing and dosing conventional medications.</p><p/><p>Asking about herb use can be done during the medication history by asking: &quot;What prescription medications, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbs, or supplements do you use?&quot;</p><p>This encourages communication by demonstrating the practitioner's interest in the information and willingness to discuss herb and supplement use. It is also appropriate to put a question like this into medical intake questionnaires filled out prior to the appointment.</p><p>When the ingredients of a commercial herbal product are unknown, practitioners can consult the <a href=\"https://dsld.nlm.nih.gov/dsld/&amp;token=LdSgibWYbMmP/uu5u9ItB+fhj9bO6KZAH6hd6cBChgQJFtmW7NYFBXpVNxWgSemq&amp;TOPIC_ID=100663\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Dietary Supplement Labels Database</a> or the product's website.</p><p>Patients who use herbs should be asked about their reasons for use. Motivation for herb use is often not based on scientific data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of herbal users surveyed, 72 percent stated they would continue using supplements despite a negative government scientific study. Instead, patients often get their information about herbs from family, friends, advertisements, and the Internet. Patients can be directed to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html&amp;token=d5ngiCbB8xFYJWkFI1xcekh7CTTcVcbY3fVxLXEvc7QOB7U2Z2milqPsXTe2p13sLubduV6ISjc1JlpILP5OHQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=100663\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MedlinePlus</a> for free evidence-based information about many herbal products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Advising patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The schema in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64011 \">table 8</a>), can be used to develop an approach to advising patients about an herbal product based upon the evidence for that product's quality, efficacy, and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/53,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,58</a>].</p><p>If there is strong evidence for an herbal product's quality, safety, and efficacy, it may be reasonable to proactively recommend that product and closely monitor the patient for effectiveness and safety. Given the frequent uncertainty in herbal product quality, which impacts the product's efficacy and safety, few herbal products fit these criteria.</p><p>By contrast, it would be appropriate to discourage use of products when there is strong evidence for either lack of quality, inefficacy, or harmfulness. Examples of products that should be discouraged include traditional herbal medicines known to contain toxic heavy metals, St. John's wort when taken with medicines metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and ephedra-related products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The majority of herbal products do not fall into either the recommend or discourage category due to uncertain, insufficient, or contradictory evidence regarding quality, efficacy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> safety. For these products, clinicians should counsel and caution patients regarding the uncertainty of the evidence. The impact of uncertain quality on efficacy and safety should be emphasized. If the patient chooses to proceed with an herbal product, a plan should be agreed on for ongoing monitoring for both benefits and adverse effects. These discussions should be documented clearly in the medical record.</p><p>Clinicians need to take into account patients' individual health conditions, concerns, and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Patients seeking or already using herbal treatments should have an appropriate evaluation for their condition such that proven conventional treatments can be offered for any diagnosed conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>For the patient who decides to use an herbal product against the advice of his or her clinician, a nonjudgmental attitude should be maintained. This will allow channels of communication to remain open for monitoring and future discussion. A patient's decision to pursue herbal therapy against medical advice or in lieu of conventional therapy is not an acceptable justification for a clinician to terminate care of a patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of brand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who use herbs often ask their providers what brand should be used. Lack of regulatory reform in the herbal industry makes it difficult for the clinician to provide an informed response. One option is to recommend brands that have been tested by independent sources, such as <a href=\"http://www.consumerlab.com/&amp;token=dTWXrNv+StOeNp8kvk4ODI4pHBI0lIEojB4g/rS7BQcYUEwcmC7nxojO1snKY5ip&amp;TOPIC_ID=100663\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ConsumerLab.com</a> and found to meet minimum quality criteria. For ethical reasons, supplements sold through practitioners' offices or multilevel marketing plans should be discouraged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Special populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy and nursing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few animal or human studies have been conducted on the safety of herbal medicines in pregnancy or while nursing. Given the paucity of data for these populations as well as the uncertainty in product quality, women who are pregnant, contemplating pregnancy, or lactating should generally be discouraged from using herbal treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents should be cautioned about the relative lack of studies demonstrating efficacy and safety of herbal medicines in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Additional concerns are proper dosing in this age group, greater susceptibility to potential contaminants, and uncertainty of product quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caution should be exercised in the use of herbs in older adults due to possible decreased renal and hepatic clearance of herb and drug metabolites. Additionally, for older individuals taking multiple medications, there is a greater potential for herb-drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No large prospective study of the impact of perioperative herb use on surgical outcomes has been completed. Herbs may theoretically impact surgery through altered coagulation (eg, ginkgo, ginseng, garlic), cardiovascular stability (eg, ephedra), glucose control (ginseng), anesthesia (eg, valerian, kava), and increased metabolism of perioperative medication (eg, St. John's wort). Case reports of perioperative bleeding associated with <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>] and saw palmetto [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>] have been reported. Authors have recommended avoiding herbs for at least two weeks prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-herbal-medicine-and-dietary-supplements/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herbal treatments are widely used by patients in the United States and elsewhere.
