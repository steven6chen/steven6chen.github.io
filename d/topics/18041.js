In preliminary studies of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], UDCA was found to provide marked improvement in liver tests, leading to randomized trials and meta-analyses that also found a benefit.

Six of the largest trials will be reviewed briefly to illustrate the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. Each of these administered UDCA from two to up to six years in a dose of 13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. UDCA was well tolerated and very few patients had to discontinue therapy because of side effects. In three of these trials patients who were initially given placebo were placed on UDCA after two years because of the significant improvement in liver function tests in those patients who were treated with UDCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/6,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,11,12</a>]. In one of the studies, patients in the control group remained on placebo for four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 180 patients at one medical center, UDCA led to a significant decrease in the plasma levels of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although there were also fewer deaths in the treatment arm, there was no improvement in fatigue, pruritus, liver histology, or referral for liver transplantation. In a follow-up report in which treatment had been continued for a total of three years, UDCA was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death and need for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a multicenter Canadian study with 222 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The active therapy group had lower plasma levels of the aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, IgM, and cholesterol. Fatigue, pruritus, and the rates of liver transplantation and death were unchanged. There was, however, a beneficial effect on liver histology as manifested by decreased progression of periportal hepatocellular ballooning and bile duct loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results were similar in a multicenter trial of 151 patients in the United States. Patients were stratified into four groups at the start of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Stratification was based upon the initial serum bilirubin level (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> was the cutoff level) and on the histological stage (early [stages I and II] or late [stages II and IV]). Only patients in one stratum benefited from UDCA: those with serum bilirubin levels less than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> <strong>and</strong> stage I or II disease. A follow-up report of these patients (during which all received open-label UDCA for an additional two years) found no significant impact on rates of liver transplantation or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This study had three important limitations: (1) the dose of UDCA was probably too low (10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day compared with the standard dose of 13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), (2) the study was underpowered to detect differences in survival, (3) milligram per milligram, the bioavailability of Actigall preparation that was used in the study is approximately two-thirds that of the URSO 250 tablet available in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; the latter is the formulation that was used in the Mayo study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and comparable to that used in the French [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and Canadian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the fourth trial, performed primarily in Europe, 145 patients were randomized to UDCA or placebo for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and then all patients received UDCA for two additional years in an open-label trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The progression of PBC, as defined by the onset of hyperbilirubinemia or the development of variceal bleeding, ascites, or encephalopathy, was delayed in the patients receiving UDCA throughout the study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59511 \">figure 1</a>). The probability of liver transplantation or death was also decreased by UDCA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82631\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82631 \">figure 2</a>). This effect, however, was not seen until the second two years of the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fifth trial included 192 consecutive patients who were randomly assigned to UDCA (14 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients were followed for a median of 3.4 years (range 0.3 to 6.1 years). UDCA treatment was associated with significant decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alanine aminotransferase, and cholesterol levels. Treatment failure (death or liver transplantation) was observed in 17 patients receiving UDCA and 11 receiving placebo. Times to death or liver transplantation were not significantly different. However, histologic improvement (and a delay in stage progression) occurred more often in the treatment group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a follow-up report, the authors described the clinical course of patients who achieved a biochemical response to UDCA (defined as a decrease in alkaline phosphatase to &lt;40 percent of pretreatment levels at one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Using this definition, 117 patients (60 percent) were considered responders. Survival free of liver transplantation was significantly higher than predicted by the Mayo model and was similar to that of the general population during a mean follow-up of seven years. By contrast, survival free of liver transplantation among nonresponders was significantly worse than the general population (although better than predicted by the Mayo model).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were reported in a later study with 292 patients that found significantly better 10-year transplant-free survival (90 versus 51 percent) in patients who achieved an alkaline phosphatase &lt;3 times the upper limit and a total bilirubin &le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and a serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal within one year of beginning UDCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Two other reports also confirmed a better prognosis in patients who achieved a biochemical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on liver histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the individual trials suggested that UDCA is associated with a beneficial effect on liver histology. One of the largest studies to focus on this issue included a total of 367 who had participated in four clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Paired liver biopsy specimens were compared after approximately 36 months of treatment. No overall benefit from UDCA was seen when the whole group was analyzed together. However, a significant benefit was observed in patients with stage I or II disease, including a reduction in the degree of ductular proliferation and in the progression of periportal necroinflammatory lesions. Similar benefits have been described in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal varices and portal hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether UDCA prevents the development of esophageal varices is uncertain. A randomized trial that directly addressed this issue found a significantly lower rate of development of new esophageal varices compared with placebo after four years' follow-up (16 versus 58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another report, the portohepatic gradient (PHG) and liver enzymes were measured before and at two years of treatment with UDCA in 132 patients with PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. After two years of treatment, a decreased or stable PHG and normalization of AST levels were predictive of improved survival. Patients with stable or improved PHG and normalized AST level at two years had a 15-year survival similar to that of a control population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">META-ANALYSES AND POPULATION-BASED STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the number of patients in almost all individual trials was too small to detect a difference in survival in the short term with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a combined analysis of three randomized trials (with a total of 548 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8</a>] was subsequently performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. UDCA was associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of liver transplantation or death compared with placebo (47 versus 66 patients at four years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This benefit was seen in patients with moderate and severe disease, but not in those with mild disease (serum bilirubin concentration &lt;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> stage I or II histologic change), in whom progression to end-stage liver disease did not occur in this short time interval. In two separate reports, the benefit of UDCA appeared to persist for up to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Other meta-analyses have been reported, which have reached variable conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/4,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two meta-analyses of 16 randomized trials (with a total of 1447 patients) found that UDCA had no effect on overall or transplant-free mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials found no differences between UDCA and placebo in the incidence of death, liver-related death, liver transplantation, or the development of complications of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The authors concluded that the available evidence does not demonstrate a benefit for UDCA, and its use as standard therapy needs to be reexamined. However, most of the studies included in the meta-analysis were of two years duration, which may have been too short to determine the efficacy of any medical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fourth meta-analysis that included seven randomized trials concluded that long-term UDCA significantly improved transplant-free survival and delayed histologic progression in early-stage patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Discrepancies between meta-analyses and large clinical trials (and among meta-analysis) are common. They are often due to different baseline risks in the study populations, variable protocols and study quality, different assumptions when combining data, and publication bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A decision analysis considering these factors concluded that treatment with UDCA in early stages (stages 1 or 2) was associated with survival similar to an age-matched control population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

It found that men were less likely than women to respond to UDCA (72 versus 80 percent). In addition, younger age at the time of diagnosis was associated with a poor response (&lt;50 percent for patients diagnosed younger than age 30 years and 90 percent for patients diagnosed after the age of 70 years).</p><p>UDCA should be considered first line therapy given the results of the individual trials and the limited alternatives for patients with PBC.
