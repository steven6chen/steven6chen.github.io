This term has been broadened to include all conditions in which antegrade ventricular activation or retrograde atrial activation occurs partially or totally via an anomalous pathway distinct from the normal cardiac conduction system.</p><p>The classic form of cardiac preexcitation is the WPW pattern, which is characterized by a short PR interval and a broad QRS complex with a delta wave. The anatomic substrate for this is a band of myocytes that bridges the fibrous atrioventricular junction, also known as the bundle of Kent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The electrocardiographic features are a result of premature ventricular activation due to conduction over the accessory pathway.

However, most lack the histopathologic correlation that has been demonstrated for the WPW pattern. This topic will discuss the Mahaim fiber tachycardias. WPW and other non-WPW forms of preexcitation are discussed separately.

These fibers were termed Mahaim or fasciculoventricular fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This description was subsequently expanded to include connections between the atrioventricular (AV) node and the ventricular myocardium (nodoventricular fibers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69078 \">figure 1</a>). These findings have been confirmed by other investigators, but true continuity of these pathways is less common than was initially suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>Mahaim fibers were originally classified into two main groups depending upon their site of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodoventricular fibers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasciculoventricular fibers</p><p/><p>This classification had a functional as well as an anatomic significance, since the two groups were thought to be associated with different clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The nodoventricular connections were presumed responsible for the generation of an AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) with a left bundle branch block morphology that had unique electrophysiologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. This arrhythmia was not seen in patients with fasciculoventricular fibers.</p><p>This classification for Mahaim fibers persisted until evidence suggested that the anatomic cause for the tachycardia with characteristics previously attributed to nodoventricular fibers is a slowly conducting AV accessory pathway with decremental conduction (ie, conduction slows at faster heart rates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. This accessory pathway, which only conducts in an antegrade fashion, most often arises in the anterior wall of the right atrium and inserts into the right ventricle, close to the right bundle branch.</p><p>These unusual accessory pathways are responsible for the constellation of electrophysiologic features that define Mahaim tachycardias. Histologic and functional examination of tissue from patients treated surgically has demonstrated an accessory pathway with features similar to normal atrioventricular nodal tissue. The presence of nodal tissue in the accessory pathway would account for the decremental properties seen in Mahaim fibers, which is not characteristic of other accessory pathways.

Approximately 40 percent of patients with Mahaim fibers have other accessory AV connections or dual AV nodal pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/5,7,8,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8,16,17</a>]. In some cases, an accessory AV pathway can mask the presence of a Mahaim fiber which only becomes apparent after surgical or catheter ablation of the accessory pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Mahaim fibers are also associated with Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Uncommonly, a narrow complex tachycardia is associated with VA block and the most common etiology is a concealed nodofascicular pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This may be suspected when intermittent antegrade preexcitation occurs, when the tachycardia is initiated by a single atrial premature complex which produces two ventricular complexes, or when a single ventricular extrastimulus initiates the tachycardia without a retrograde His deflection.

In contrast, among 200 young adults with a history of palpitations but no structural heart disease, a narrow QRS with an rS in III was found in only 6 percent.</p><p>In contrast to the WPW pattern, there is no delta wave with Mahaim fiber conduction. As noted above, the Mahaim pathways terminate in the ventricles into or near the conducting system; in contrast, insertion occurs into the ventricular myocardium, with slow muscle fiber-to-muscle fiber conduction in patients with the WPW pattern. It is this combination of preexcited and slowed conduction that is responsible for the delta wave.

What follows is a description of the electrophysiologic findings and then the mechanism by which they occur. At higher pacing rates, antegrade decremental conduction within the Mahaim pathway results in prolongation of AV interval and progressive ventricular preexcitation, resulting in a QRS complex with a left bundle branch morphology. The increasing preexcitation leads to progressive displacement of the His deflection into the QRS complex. Even after maximal preexcitation has occurred, the AV interval continues to prolong at higher pacing rates because of further decremental conduction.</p><p>The QRS morphology associated with maximal preexcitation during atrial pacing is identical to that seen during left bundle branch tachycardia. However, at a critical coupling interval during decremental atrial pacing, a Mahaim tachycardia with a left bundle branch block morphology can usually be induced. The ventricular electrogram during tachycardia is not preceded by a His electrogram, and the earliest evidence of retrograde atrial activation occurs in the His bundle region.</p><p>These findings are due to the conduction characteristics of the normal AV node and the decremental accessory pathway. At long pacing cycle lengths (slow pacing rates), the majority of ventricular activation occurs via the AV <span class=\"nowrap\">node/His-Purkinje</span> system and there is little preexcitation. AV nodal conduction time increases at shorter pacing cycle lengths (faster pacing rates), resulting in a greater contribution of Mahaim conduction to ventricular activation and an increase in the degree of preexcitation. Maximal preexcitation occurs when ventricular activation is exclusively via Mahaim conduction. The reentrant circuit is completed when there is retrograde conduction via the AV node, allowing reactivation of the atria.</p><p>This mechanism of tachycardia has been further supported by the selective recording of His bundle and right bundle branch electrograms in patients with Mahaim fiber tachycardia. One study demonstrated that decremental atrial pacing led to reversal of the sequence of His bundle and right bundle branch activation associated with the appearance of progressive ventricular preexcitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Before the onset of tachycardia, there was complete reversal, with right bundle branch activation occurring prior to His bundle activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiologic mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mapping of Mahaim fibers is performed to identify ablation sites in patients with symptomatic arrhythmias. However, because of their conduction properties and anatomic location, it is difficult to map both the proximal (atrial) and distal (ventricular) insertion of Mahaim fibers. Mahaim fibers do not conduct in a retrograde fashion so the proximal insertion cannot be identified by ventricular pacing. The technique used to identify the proximal insertion depends upon the type of pathway present. With the less common atrioventricular fibers, the technique of mapping at the tricuspid annulus for earliest ventricular activation and shortest atrioventricular interval during tachycardia-preexcitation can be used.</p><p>However, this method of mapping will not identify the atrial insertion of the atriofascicular pathway. Three methods of mapping atriofascicular fibers have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulus to delta-wave mapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premature right atrial stimulation during tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recording of Mahaim potentials at the tricuspid annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,22</a>]</p><p/><p>The last technique, identification of pathway potentials at the tricuspid annulus, has several advantages. A Mahaim potential will be recorded only in very close proximity to the atrial insertion of the accessory pathway and, therefore, is likely to be a good predictor of a successful ablation site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79320\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79320 \">waveform 3</a>). Mahaim potentials appear as a discrete sharp potential (morphologically similar to a His potential) lying between the atrial and ventricular electrograms recorded at the tricuspid annulus during tachycardia or preexcited atrial pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/14,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21-23</a>].</p><p>The long intracardiac course and distal insertion of the atriofascicular fibers which shows arborization makes mapping of the ventricular insertion difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A propensity to temporary loss of conduction of the Mahaim fiber due to catheter trauma further complicates ventricular mapping. Rather than mapping, there have been attempts to &quot;cure&quot; the tachycardia by ablation of the right bundle branch which in some patients is the distal point of accessory pathway insertion. However, ablation of the right bundle branch within the ventricle can result in lengthening of the tachycardia circuit and more incessant tachycardia. Because of these problems, ablation is usually aimed at the proximal (atrial) insertion of the pathway. In some cases, however, mapping and subsequent ablation of the ventricular insertion has been achieved with preservation of AV nodal conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Less frequently, the retrograde limb uses another accessory AV pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/5,7,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,24,25</a>]. Mahaim fibers can also function as a bystander pathway, conducting an impulse antegradely during an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61702 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62450\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62450 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69146\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69146 \">waveform 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>].</p><p>In Mahaim tachycardia, premature right atrial extrastimuli during tachycardia will usually result in preexcitation (advancement) of the next ventricular complex. This response of the tachycardia to premature atrial extrastimuli has been used by some investigators to suggest that the right atrium is an integral part of the tachycardia circuit and has been utilized in mapping of the atrial insertion of the accessory connection during catheter ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>AV dissociation during the tachycardia has also been described, a finding which would preclude the atria as part of the reentrant circuit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The variable pattern of atrial involvement in the tachycardia circuit suggests that there may be more than one anatomic substrate responsible for Mahaim fiber tachycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to other types of preexcitation syndromes, there are two treatment options available for treatment of Mahaim fiber tachycardias: pharmacologic therapy and curative ablation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the development of ablation techniques, empiric drug therapy was the preferred treatment of Mahaim tachycardia. Since this is an uncommon cause of tachycardia, there have been no large-scale comparative trials of different classes of drugs. The published data are limited to case reports and small studies demonstrating sensitivity to various classes of antiarrhythmic agents.</p><p>Anterograde conduction in Mahaim tachycardia appears to be sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> but not to other agents that predominately affect the AV node, such as calcium blockers and beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In some cases, however, the AV nodal blocking agents may be effective in preventing tachycardia by affecting retrograde AV nodal conduction in the retrograde limb of the tachycardia. Both class IA and IC agents also may slow or prevent tachycardia in patients with Mahaim fiber tachycardias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presumed close relationship between the Mahaim fiber and normal AV nodal conduction tissue and the potential for complete AV nodal block with surgical intervention has resulted in little enthusiasm for operative therapy. However, the identification of right anterior accessory atrioventricular connections as the cause of most cases of Mahaim tachycardia has led to renewed interest in surgical division of the Mahaim fiber with preservation of normal AV nodal conduction. A number of small series have reported excellent results in symptomatic patients with these accessory AV connections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been several reports of direct current (DC) catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction for treatment of recurrent tachycardia in patients with Mahaim fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In one series of three patients, ablation of the AV node interrupted an integral part of the tachycardia circuit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Despite the development of complete AV nodal block, there was preservation of antegrade Mahaim conduction, resulting in maximal ventricular preexcitation. These findings suggest that the Mahaim fibers in these cases were remote from the AV node rather than representing true nodofascicular fibers; the hypothesis is that most cases of Mahaim tachycardia are due to discrete atrioventricular pathways.</p><p>In an attempt to ablate Mahaim fiber conduction with preservation of AV nodal conduction, one study of three patients with refractory Mahaim tachycardia performed DC catheter ablation at the site of presumed ventricular insertion of the Mahaim fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The ventricular insertion site was located using pace mapping, unipolar ventricular electrogram recordings, and identification of the earliest local electrogram relative to surface preexcited QRS. In all three cases, there was loss of Mahaim conduction without any change to AV nodal conduction parameters. Right bundle branch block persisted in two patients after ablation.</p><p>Radiofrequency catheter ablation has been highly successful in the general treatment of accessory AV pathways, including right-sided atrioventricular accessory pathways with decremental properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mahaim-fiber-tachycardias/abstract/13,14,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,20-23</a>]. Detailed electrophysiologic assessment and mapping is required before considering radiofrequency ablation of patients with Mahaim fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79320\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79320 \">waveform 3</a>). It is important to exclude additional accessory AV connections since their presence may influence the approach to ablation.</p><p>Catheter ablation offers a definitive therapy for patients with right free wall decremental accessory pathways resulting in Mahaim tachycardia. The unique properties of these pathways pose some difficulties in the mapping of the insertion of the pathway and therefore the appropriate ablation site. Initial results suggest that mapping of the atrial insertion using the identification of a &quot;Mahaim potential&quot; is the best method to guide the site for ablation.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Conditions associated with Mahaim fibers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with Mahaim fibers is usually normal, due to preferential ventricular activation via the AV node at normal resting heart rates. In contrast to the WPW pattern, there is no delta wave with Mahaim fiber conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG features that are suggestive (but not diagnostic) of Mahaim fibers as the cause of a tachycardia with a left bundle branch block pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56384\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56384 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58895\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58895 \">waveform 2</a>) include: QRS axis between 0 and minus 75 degrees, QRS duration of 0.15 seconds or less, R-wave in lead 1, rS complex in lead V1, precordial transition in lead V4 or later, and cycle length between 220 and 450 milliseconds (heart rates of 130 to 270 beats per minute). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two types of Mahaim pathways, atriofascicular and atrioventricular, can be distinguished by recording the site of earliest ventricular activation during tachycardia or maximal preexcitation. The most characteristic electrophysiologic feature of Mahaim fibers is their response to atrial pacing at progressively increasing rates (decremental atrial pacing). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiology of Mahaim fibers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual arrhythmia in patients with a Mahaim fiber tachycardia is a reentrant tachycardia using the Mahaim fiber as the antegrade limb (since it only conducts in an antegrade fashion) and the AV node as the retrograde limb of the circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61702 \">figure 3</a>). Less frequently, the retrograde limb uses another accessory AV pathway. Mahaim fibers can also function as a bystander pathway, conducting an impulse antegradely during an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to other types of preexcitation syndromes, there are two treatment options available for treatment of Mahaim fiber tachycardias: pharmacologic therapy and curative ablation. Since this is an uncommon cause of tachycardia, there have been no large-scale comparative trials of different classes of medications. Catheter ablation offers the greatest chance at definitive therapy for patients with decremental accessory pathways resulting in Mahaim tachycardia.
