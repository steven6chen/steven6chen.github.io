Between these extremes are suicide threats and suicide attempts (potentially self-injurious action with a nonfatal outcome for which there is evidence that the individual intended to kill him- or herself) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children and adolescents who present for medical attention with suicidal behavior require a variable amount of medical, social, and psychiatric intervention depending upon the seriousness of their intent, their underlying risk factors, and their emotional support system.</p><p>The epidemiology of and risk factors for childhood and adolescent suicide will be reviewed here.

In the United States, suicide rates doubled in the 15- to 19-year age group and tripled in the 10- to 14-year age group between the 1960s and the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reasons for this trend are unclear, although it is not simply because of increased reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Possible explanations include increased rates of alcohol and drug abuse, depression, family and social disorganization, and access to firearms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Suicide is the third leading cause of death among all children and adolescents in the United States, including those aged 10 to 19 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67131\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67131 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Adolescent suicide rates declined somewhat between the late 1980s and 2003, but increased between 2003 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and again between 2008 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In 2009, there were 1922 suicides reported for children younger than 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Suicide accounted for 14 percent of deaths in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, and 8 percent of deaths in children aged 10 to 14 years.</p><p>Between 2003 and 2004, suicide rates increased among females aged 10 to 14 years (by 76 percent), females aged 15 to 19 years (by 32 percent), and males aged 15 to 19 years (by 9 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79081 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The reasons for this increase are not clear; possible explanations include the misclassification of unintentional asphyxia from adolescents playing &quot;the choking game&quot; (ie, intentionally restricting the supply of oxygenation to the brain, often with a ligature, to induce a brief euphoria) and changes in risk factors for suicide or suicide methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The potential impact of the United States Food and Drug Administration warning regarding the risk of suicidality and antidepressants on the rates of antidepressant prescriptions and suicide is discussed separately.

Available data indicate that there are as many as 50 to 100 suicide attempts for every completed suicide in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Survey data from the United States in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 found that approximately 7 to 9 percent of all adolescents attempted suicide in the 12 months before the survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>], and cross-sectional data from a self-report questionnaire administered to 15- and 16-year-old students attending 41 schools in England provided similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A more recent nationally representative, retrospective survey of adolescents (n = 6483) in the United States found a lifetime prevalence of suicide attempt in 4 percent; among adolescents who attempted suicide, 67 percent had a lifetime history of treatment or some type of services prior to their attempt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The reasons reported for suicide attempt vary by sex and age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69888\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69888 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Suicidal ideation often precedes suicide attempts. A nationally representative survey in the United States found that among adolescents who suffered suicidal ideation, a subsequent attempt occurred in 34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suicidal ideation occurs in prepubertal children, but suicide attempts and completions are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Between 2008 and 2012, the incidence rate of suicide among children aged 5 to 11 years in the United States was 1 per 1 million (a total of 155 children committed suicide) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>After puberty, the rate of suicide among adolescents increases with increasing age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56318\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56318 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As an example, data from the United States (both public health surveillance in 16 states from 2005 to 2009, and death certificates from 50 states from 2010) showed that the rate of suicide deaths among children aged 10 to 14 years was 1 per 100,000, and for children aged 15 to 19 years was 7 to 8 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Potential explanations for the increased incidence of suicide attempts and completion with increasing age include increased access to firearms and potentially lethal drugs, increased rates of psychiatric illness, substance abuse, and other comorbidities, as well as changes in cognitive development. As adolescents develop their capacities for abstract and complex thinking, they are more capable of contemplating life circumstances, envisioning a hopeless future, generating suicide as a possible solution, and planning and executing a suicide attempt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Younger children who complete suicide are more likely to be of above-average intelligence, possibly exposing them to the developmental level of stress experienced by older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In addition, puberty may have a negative impact, particularly for girls, when there is a lack of synchrony between the timing of pubertal development and chronologic age. In a large cross-sectional study, girls who matured early were more likely to have a lifetime history of disruptive behavior disorder and suicide attempts than their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Female high school students are more likely than males to have a specific suicide plan (median of 16 versus 11 percent, with a range of 13 to 20 percent and 8 to 15 percent for females versus males, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast, the rates of having a specific plan are similar between the genders in college students (approximately 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Suicide attempts are also more common in adolescent girls than boys. As an example, a nationally representative survey in the United States found that the one-year prevalence of suicide attempt was two times greater in females than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and a second such survey found that the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempt was three times greater in adolescent females (6 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160;</p><p>However, adolescent boys are more likely to complete suicide than girls. As an example, public health data from the United States showed that the rate of suicide deaths among males aged 10 to 19 years was 7 per 100,000, and for females was 2 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Most studies relate the differences in completion rates to the method chosen. Girls tend to choose less lethal means such as overdose or cutting, whereas boys tend to choose firearms and hanging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76221 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. Another lethal method of suicide that is more common in males (usually older adolescents and adults) is &quot;suicide by cop&quot;, in which the suicidal individual engages in conspicuous and threatening behavior with a lethal or apparently lethal weapon in an attempt provoke law enforcement officers to shoot him to protect civilians or in self-defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This method is also known as police-assisted suicide, victim-precipitated homicide, and law-enforcement-assisted suicide.</p><p>Differences in the rate of adolescent depression between boys and girls may explain at least some of the difference in the rates of suicide attempts. As puberty progresses, most boys develop a more positive self-image and mood, but girls, particularly white girls, have a diminished sense of self-worth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. During adolescence, the prevalence of depression increases and becomes twice as high among girls as boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>].

Among adolescents, the suicide rate is highest for white males. However, between 1980 and 1996, the suicide rate increased most rapidly among black males ages 15 to 19 years (from 3.6 to 8.1 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. On the other hand, in the 2007 YRBSS, Hispanic adolescents were more likely than black or white adolescents to report a suicide attempt in the previous 12 months (10 versus 8 versus 6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much effort in psychiatric medicine has gone into identifying risk factors for suicide. Improved ability to identify individuals who are at risk for suicide attempts and completion may facilitate prevention and enable more appropriate allocation of resources. Unfortunately, factors that reliably differentiate between suicide ideators, attempters, and completers have not yet been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

A study of primary care health records from 2001 to 2014 identified patients aged 10 to 19 years with an episode of self-harm (n &gt;8000), and control patients with no record of self-harm (n &gt;170,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].

There are as many as 50 to 100 suicide attempts for every completed suicide in adolescents. Surveys estimate that the 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts in adolescents is 7 to 9 percent.
