The eye misalignment can involve either eye and can occur in any direction; it can be congenital or acquired, latent or manifest, constant or intermittent, and fixed or variable, depending upon the position of gaze and other factors.</p><p>Strabismus can be classified according to the direction of deviation: in (esodeviations), out (exodeviations), and up or down (vertical deviations). The causes of horizontal strabismus are reviewed here. The evaluation of strabismus and the causes of vertical strabismus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of strabismus in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of vertical strabismus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three pairs of extraocular muscles move each eye in three directions: vertically (superior and inferior), horizontally (medially [adduction] and laterally [abduction]), and torsionally (intorsion when the eye rotates nasally and extorsion when the eye rotates temporally along the visual axis). The superior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve IV, the lateral rectus muscle by cranial nerve VI, and all others by cranial nerve III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The understanding of strabismus requires knowledge of the two major principles that govern ocular motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agonist muscles in both eyes receive equal innervation to ensure coordinated binocular eye movements.

To focus properly on a near object, the ciliary muscle must alter the shape of the lens (accommodation), and both eyes must deviate inward (convergence). In children who have normal ocular alignment, accommodation is associated with a predictable and physiologic amount of convergence. In children who have accommodative esotropia, the physiologic convergence cannot be overcome by fusional divergence (ie, movement of the eyes away from each other to restore binocular vision), and as a result, esotropia occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57340 \">picture 1</a>). Accommodative esotropia occurs more commonly in children who have hyperopia (farsightedness).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accommodative esotropia usually presents in the second year of life but may rarely be present in children as young as three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and can occur later in life. Early-onset accommodative esotropia appears to occur more commonly in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At the time of onset, the crossing usually is intermittent and often more pronounced with near than with distant fixation. Over time, the deviation can become more pronounced and constant. Amblyopia occurs in approximately 20 percent of patients with accommodative esotropia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with accommodative esotropia can achieve long-term stabilization of ocular alignment with cycloplegic refraction and prescription of hyperopic spectacles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57340 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Bifocals are sometimes used to control the ocular alignment for near vision. However, fusion for distance fixation is often sufficient to maintain binocular function and some pediatric ophthalmologists do not use bifocals to control a residual near-deviation. Surgical correction of residual esodeviation may be necessary in some patients, more likely in those with delayed diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Topical miotic agents (eg, phospholine iodide, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbachol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbachol</a>) have been used by some practitioners to manipulate accommodation, but lack of availability, limited experience, and side effects limit use of these drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic infantile esotropia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic infantile esotropia, or &quot;congenital&quot; esotropia, is another common type of childhood strabismus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72282\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72282 \">picture 2</a>). This esodeviation has onset before six months of age and occurs in children who have a low refractive error and who are neurologically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. Although the esotropia is usually not present at birth, theory suggests that there is a central anomaly of fusion, which is present at birth. The cause of this fusion anomaly remains unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The esotropia of idiopathic infantile esotropia typically is a large-angle esotropia, usually greater than 25 to 30 prism diopters. Children who have idiopathic infantile esotropia sometimes turn their faces toward the fixing eye, which is preferably positioned in adduction (cross-fixation). Thus, the right eye views objects in the left visual field, and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Idiopathic infantile esotropia is associated with a variety of other ocular motility abnormalities that may manifest later in childhood. These commonly develop despite surgical therapy and initial good ocular alignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Duane syndrome and Moebius syndrome are present at birth, whereas idiopathic infantile esotropia typically has onset during the first six months of life but is rarely present at birth. In addition, children with Duane syndrome usually have a small-angle esotropia (usually less than 20 prism diopters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and those with Moebius syndrome usually have involvement of the facial and other cranial nerves. Children who have infantile esotropia usually have a low refractive error, whereas those with accommodative esotropia usually have greater hyperopia, and those with sensory esotropia have poor vision in the affected eye, usually because of an anatomic abnormality.</p><p>Idiopathic infantile esotropia may be particularly difficult to differentiate from congenital or early-onset abducens palsy, because infants who have idiopathic infantile esotropia and large deviations may have difficulty abducting one or both eyes because of secondary contracture of the medial rectus muscle(s). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) palsy in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) Oculocephalic testing, with or without monocular occlusion, may be helpful in making this distinction. Furthermore, abduction velocity (saccades) can usually be documented to be brisk in patients with idiopathic infantile esotropia, but not in those with abducens palsy. Distinguishing between the two disorders is important because the evaluation and treatment may differ. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the treatment of children with idiopathic infantile esotropia is to maximize visual acuity by treatment of amblyopia if it is present. Surgery designed to strengthen or weaken the extraocular muscles is the mainstay of therapy. The procedure most commonly performed is designed to weaken the medial rectus muscle(s). It is most commonly performed in both eyes. Successful ocular alignment initially is achieved in the majority of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, many children later develop recurrent esotropia, consecutive or secondary exotropia, or other eye movement abnormalities associated with the esotropia syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Earlier realignment appears to be associated with better sensory outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Injection of botulinum toxin into the medial rectus muscle of one or both eyes also has been used to treat idiopathic infantile esotropia. Injection of this toxin creates temporary paresis of the medial rectus muscle. More than one injection is needed in most children. Long-term improvement may result from changes in the rectus muscle's <span class=\"nowrap\">length/tension</span> relationships or in the child's fusional capacity during the temporary paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a randomized trial comparing reoperation and botulinum toxin injection in 55 children who failed initial surgical treatment, the long-term outcomes were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Duane syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/126800&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl/z7sFdXuSx8tgoT0Op78emVEd1Qi3vO1myzEFHHSDghte0Pf&amp;TOPIC_ID=6265\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Duane syndrome</a>, also called Duane retraction syndrome or the Stilling-Turk-Duane syndrome, is a congenital strabismus that is caused by failure of normal development of the abducens nerve (the sixth cranial nerve) followed by anomalous innervation of the lateral rectus muscle by the oculomotor nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/22,28-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28-34</a>].

Familial cases usually are bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The angle of deviation typically is small (&lt;20 to 30 prism diopters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. One of the characteristic features of Duane syndrome is the retraction of the globe and narrowing of the palpebral fissure during attempted adduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76031\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76031 \">picture 3</a>). This feature is caused by the simultaneous contraction of the medial and lateral rectus muscles that occurs during attempted adduction. Some patients with Duane syndrome may have normal ocular alignment in the straight-ahead (or primary) position and manifest deviation only in the lateral-gaze position.</p><p>Other clinical features include abnormal tilt or turn of the head (torticollis) to permit fusion and upshoot <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> downshoot of the affected eye in adduction. These movements are thought to be caused by a &quot;leash&quot; phenomenon of the lateral rectus muscle or aberrant innervation of the vertical rectus muscles. Patients with Duane syndrome also may have amblyopia and unequal refractive errors (anisometropia). Extraocular features of Duane syndrome include thenar hypoplasia and radial ray abnormalities, deafness, and fusion of the second and third cervical vertebrae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/28,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of Duane syndrome is similar to that of that other forms of strabismus.

The most common cause of exodeviation in children is intermittent exotropia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Other causes include type II Duane syndrome, oculomotor nerve paresis, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, sensory exotropia (related to decreased visual acuity in one eye), and consecutive exotropia (exotropia after surgery to correct esotropia). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Duane syndrome'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent exotropia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent exotropia is the most common exodeviation of childhood, affecting almost 1 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The typical onset occurs when the child is two to three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with intermittent exotropia usually present with a complaint that one eye &quot;floats&quot; or &quot;drifts&quot; when the child is tired or inattentive. In the early stages of this condition, the child can control the deviation and realign the eyes when his or her attention is brought to the problem. He or she may need to blink to help reestablish fusion, and excessive blinking may be the presenting complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The child with intermittent exotropia may have normal ocular alignment and no obvious problems at the initial clinical examination. With progression, the ocular deviation is more difficult for the child to control and tends to become manifest more frequently. Children with intermittent exotropia usually do not experience diplopia because the developing visual system of the child suppresses the unwanted image from the deviating eye, when the eye is deviating. The risk of developing amblyopia is lower than in children with esotropia. In one population-based study, more than 90 percent of children with intermittent exotropia developed myopia by the age of 20 years, whether or not they were treated surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Most patients with intermittent exotropia can be categorized according to the degree of exodeviation with distance fixation versus near fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic exotropia is the term used to describe an exodeviation that is approximately the same size at distance compared with near fixation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divergence excess-type exotropia is present when the exodeviation is greater at distance compared with near fixation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Convergence insufficiency-type exotropia is present when the exodeviation is greater at near compared with distance fixation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72919 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p>Convergence insufficiency may be associated with asthenopia (ie, eye strain) or diplopia with reading or schoolwork. It also is a common finding in presbyopic adults who require bifocals to read.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of treatments have been proposed for intermittent exotropia. However, no single treatment has proven superior for all cases, and long-term follow-up demonstrates a high recurrence rate regardless of initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/9,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39564740\"><span class=\"h4\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple observation is an acceptable method of treatment in patients who are able to control their exodeviation the majority of the time and who are otherwise asymptomatic. The symptoms that should be monitored include headache, eye strain, double vision, the closing of one eye in sunlight (eg, monocular manifest deviation), and increasing frequency of deviation. As a general rule, the prognosis for normal binocular vision and stereopsis is good if the exotropia is manifest infrequently. Intervention in these children should be determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the clinician and the parents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2923744517\"><span class=\"h4\">Vision therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vision therapy includes occlusion therapy, over-minused spectacles, and orthoptic exercises. The intervention can be passive or active:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Passive vision therapy</strong> &ndash; Passive vision therapy includes alternate part-time occlusion (patching) of one eye and usually is used in younger children with the aim of preventing or reducing suppression. In a randomized trial comparing part-time patching to observation in 201 young children with intermittent exotropia, deterioration over six months was uncommon in both groups (2.2 versus 4.6 percent, respectively; nonsignificant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Control of exotropia as assessed by a six-point score was slightly better with patching (mean score 2.3 versus 2.8), though this finding is not likely to represent a clinically meaningful difference. A similar trial in older children (ages 3 to &lt;11 years) found that part-time patching reduced the rate of deterioration over six months; however deterioration was uncommon in both groups (0.6 percent in the patching group versus 6.1 percent in the observation group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. As with all treatments for intermittent exotropia, failure and recurrence after discontinuation of therapy are common occurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The prescription of myopic spectacles is another method of passive vision therapy for intermittent exotropia. This approach is often better accepted by patients who are already spectacle wearers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who are in reasonably good control of their deviation. This method of treatment works by stimulating accommodation and accommodative convergence, thereby diminishing and even eliminating exodeviation in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. As with other methods of therapy, failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence with this treatment is a common occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active vision therapy</strong> &ndash; Active vision therapy involves a combination of eye exercises and vision-training maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This therapy may be prescribed to take place at home or administered at weekly or more frequent office encounters. In a randomized controlled trial of 221 children (aged 9 to 17 years), an intensive program of office-based vision therapy with home reinforcement was more effective in reducing signs and symptoms than several home-based therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. &quot;Active&quot; vision therapy consisted of a rigorous protocol, including a variety of exercises designed to improve vergence and accommodation. Placebo therapy consisted of procedures designed to simulate real vision <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/orthoptics</span> without the expectation of affecting vergence, accommodation, or saccadic function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although this study suggests that intensive office-based therapy is superior to placebo therapy, additional studies are needed to determine whether office-based therapy is superior to equally intensive home-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2042240862\"><span class=\"h4\">Strabismus surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strabismus surgery is the treatment used most often by ophthalmologists for advanced intermittent exotropia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Surgical guidelines typically recommend intervention when the exodeviation is manifest frequently <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the patient is symptomatic. The surgery involves weakening the lateral rectus muscles of both eyes, weakening (recession) the lateral rectus muscle and tightening (resection) the medial rectus muscle in a single eye, or strengthening the medial rectus muscles in both eyes. All procedures are similarly effective depending on the type and magnitude of exodeviation. Recurrence occurs commonly after surgery for intermittent exotropia.

Clinical findings may include deficits in elevation or depression, ptosis, and anisocoria, with a larger pupil on the involved side. In contrast to other forms of exodeviation, the exodeviation of oculomotor nerve palsy or paresis is associated with reduced ability (or inability) to adduct the affected eye. These patients also often use an anomalous head position to maintain alignment.
