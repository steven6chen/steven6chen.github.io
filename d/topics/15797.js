While most epilepsies have a diurnal component (ie, seizures may occur during both sleep and wake), several epilepsy syndromes have an especially intimate and robust relationship with sleep.</p><p>This topic reviews the pathophysiology of seizures and epilepsy related to sleep and the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of common sleep-related epilepsy syndromes.

Focal epilepsies are the most frequent manifestation of sleep-related epilepsy, accounting for about 80 percent of the pure sleep epilepsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Among patients following an apparent course of pure sleep epilepsy, the risk of developing subsequent seizures during wakefulness is approximately 6 percent within one year of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and 10 to 30 percent overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], which complicates classification and attempts to estimate prevalence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3000375585\"><span class=\"h1\">SLEEP AND EPILEPTOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep and sleep stage have a significant impact on the occurrence and frequency of both seizures and epileptiform discharges that occur in between seizures (interictal epileptiform discharges [IEDs]). In general, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep facilitates IEDs and seizures, while rapid eye movement (REM) sleep tends to inhibit seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Interictal epileptiform discharges'</a>.)</p><p>IEDs increase in frequency as sleep depth increases, usually reaching peak frequency during stage N3 of NREM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. NREM may also lead to altered spike morphology and a more extensive electrographic field of distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. The mechanism by which NREM sleep facilitates IED and seizure expression likely relates to physiological hypersynchrony and thalamocortical oscillatory neural activity during NREM sleep, as reflected on electroencephalography (EEG) by sleep spindles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103289 \">figure 1</a>). As NREM progresses, responsiveness to external stimuli progressively decreases and the arousal threshold increases, in parallel with increasing delta frequency power (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103291\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103291 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep#H630021595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;, section on 'NREM sleep'</a>.)</p><p>There is additional evidence suggesting that epileptic seizures may &quot;highjack&quot; the normal physiology of strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections and memory consolidation that occurs during N3 sleep, further strengthening the epileptogenic network in refractory focal epilepsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a pilot study in patients with focal epilepsy, nocturnal seizures were associated with worse performance on visual memory tasks, indicating that seizures may adversely impact sleep-dependent memory consolidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In contrast with NREM sleep, REM sleep is relatively inhibitory towards seizure activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one literature review, REM sleep was associated with approximately 80 percent fewer focal seizures and 30 percent fewer generalized seizures relative to wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. IEDs during REM sleep tend to be more restricted and localizing, a potentially useful diagnostic localizing feature in patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for epilepsy surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinically overt seizures occur most frequently during lighter stages of NREM sleep (N1 and N2), despite peak IED frequency during N3 sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In patients with refractory focal epilepsy being considered for epilepsy surgery, approximately one-third of recorded seizures arise from the sleep state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, focal temporal lobe seizures during sleep are more likely to spread and become generalized tonic-clonic seizures than those that arise during wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This may explain why first-time seizures or new-onset epilepsy often presents following a witnessed nocturnal convulsion.</p><p>The propensity for seizures during sleep may vary according to brain lobe or region. Patients with extratemporal seizures, especially those of frontal lobe origin, are more likely to have nocturnal seizures than patients with temporal lobe onset seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].</p><p>Sleep deprivation has long been recognized as a seizure precipitant in some patients with epilepsy, although studies have been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Comorbid sleep disorders may also aggravate seizure burden, and patients with epilepsy are at increased risk for a range of sleep disorders, including sleep-related breathing disorders and insomnia.

It is an age-dependent focal epilepsy syndrome of unknown etiology with a peak incidence in children between seven and nine years of age. A genetic basis has been suspected but is not yet well characterized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Seizures are confined to sleep in the majority of patients. The characteristic focal seizure type involves nocturnal hemifacial clonic twitching accompanied by hypersalivation, evolving to a focal hemi-tonic-clonic seizure. Nocturnal focal seizures may go unnoticed until the development of a secondarily generalized seizure. The clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of BECTS are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;, section on 'Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benign childhood epilepsy with occipital spikes</strong> &ndash; Benign childhood epilepsy with occipital spikes includes early-onset childhood occipital epilepsy, or Panayiotopoulos syndrome, and late-onset childhood occipital lobe epilepsy, or Gastaut syndrome. These syndromes share many characteristics in common with BECTS, including an onset in childhood, nocturnal predominance of seizures and interictal epileptiform activity, and benign clinical course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;, section on 'Benign childhood epilepsy with occipital spikes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2948959093\"><span class=\"h1\">NOCTURNAL (SLEEP-RELATED) FOCAL EPILEPSIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nocturnal or sleep-related focal epilepsies have traditionally been named according to the localization of seizure onset. The most common of these is sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), previously called nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE). Nocturnal temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe epilepsies (NTLE, NPLE, and NOLE, respectively) also exist but are less common and have overlapping clinical features with SHE. Most have an onset in adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3537213708\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology and genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many sleep-related focal epilepsies are genetic, but structural etiologies as well as sporadic cases with unknown etiology also occur. A family history is often present.</p><p>Genetic forms of SHE include autosomal dominant NFLE (ADNFLE), a genetically heterogeneous epilepsy syndrome associated with variable disease severity and penetrance. Mutations in the <em>CHRNA4</em> gene, which encodes for the alpha 4 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, were the first to be identified in families with ADNFLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Since then, multiple additional genes have been linked to ADNFLE, most of which are related to the cholinergic system, including <em>CHRNA2</em>, <em>CHRNB2</em>, <em>CRH</em>, <em>KCNT1</em>, and <em>DEPDC5P</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Both inherited and de novo mutations have been described, and the known mutations still only account for a minority of cases.</p><p>Neurodevelopmental lesions appear to be the most frequent structural cause of SHE, in particular type IIb focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Regardless of location, type II FCD appears to increase the risk of sleep-related seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and therefore these lesions may also explain some cases of pure sleep epilepsy in which seizures localize outside of the frontal lobe. A genetic basis for many of the neurodevelopmental lesions is increasingly recognized as well.

Cognitive and psychomotor development are usually normal, although a high prevalence of intellectual disabilities and psychiatric or behavioral problems has been noted in some families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of patients have a positive family history of epilepsy, and up to 40 percent have a personal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family history of probable parasomnias.

Seizures often have unusual yet highly stereotyped clinical characteristics, especially those of SHE, and can be mistaken for parasomnias or psychogenic nonepileptic spells due to their variably impaired awareness with partial or complete preservation of consciousness, bizarre movements, minimal postictal alteration, and absence of clear-cut ictal EEG abnormalities in some cases (see <a href=\"#H2446267223\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2898155704\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above). However, the clinical triad of stereotypy across repeated spells, multiple spells within a single night, and onset directly from the sleep state is highly suggestive of an epileptic disorder. (See <a href=\"#H4197330222\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>As in diurnal epilepsies, the electroclinical diagnosis of SHE, NTLE, NPLE, and NOLE is based on clinical features, seizure semiology, and supportive EEG findings. Most cases of SHE and NTLE are nonlesional, and therefore a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not exclude the diagnosis. In patients with diurnal focal-onset seizures arising from the frontal or temporal lobes, the designation of SHE or NTLE is typically reserved for those with a predominance of seizures during sleep (eg, &gt;90 percent) and otherwise supportive clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H2446267223\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>An awake and asleep EEG should be performed in all patients with suspected seizures during sleep, both to help confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy and to localize seizure onset. The diagnostic yield of interictal EEG in patients with nocturnal epilepsy is limited, however, especially for SHE. Repeat studies, an all-night recording, or PSG with video and a full EEG montage may be necessary to confidently capture diagnostic abnormalities; even prolonged interictal EEG studies can be normal in patients with SHE, and the absence of IEDs does not exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2898155704\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with refractory seizures being considered for epilepsy surgery, long-term video-EEG monitoring, functional or metabolic imaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive EEG monitoring may be necessary to adequately localize seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H2957605\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Seizure localization'</a>.)</p><p>Brain MRI is recommended in patients with new-onset sleep-related seizures to evaluate for focal cortical symptomatic pathology such as a tumor, infarct, vascular malformation, or a malformation of cortical development. A high-resolution, epilepsy-protocol MRI is preferred to maximize the sensitivity for detecting subtle neurodevelopmental lesions or other focal abnormalities and is required in the setting of refractory seizures.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-movements-and-behaviors-during-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal movements and behaviors during sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distinguishing sleep-related epilepsy from an NREM parasomnia can be particularly challenging in some cases. Seizures and NREM parasomnias often have similar clinical presentations, involving arousal from sleep with confusion, abnormal motor activity, or sleepwalking. Clinical features favoring a diagnosis of sleep-related epilepsy over parasomnia include stereotypy, multiple events per night, prolonged postictal confusion or lateralized weakness or aphasia, lack of corresponding dream mentation, and an abnormal ictal EEG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F103987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103987 \">table 3</a>). Conversely, features favoring a parasomnia include a low frequency of occurrence, prolonged event duration (eg, longer than two minutes), and lack of recall for the events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-arousal-from-non-rapid-eye-movement-sleep-in-adults#H1725867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The Frontal Lobe Epilepsy and Parasomnias (FLEP) scale was developed in an effort to distinguish SHE from NREM and REM parasomnias by clinical features alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104152\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104152 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A score of zero or less favors a diagnosis of parasomnia, whereas scores of 3 or greater favor SHE. A small validation study found that while the scale had excellent specificity for SHE, sensitivity was only 71 percent, nearly a third of patients (mostly those with RBD) scored in the indeterminant range of 1 to 2, and four patients (6 percent) were misclassified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The scale is therefore best used as an adjunct to the clinical history rather than as a substitute for further testing.</p><p>When the cause of recurrent nocturnal events remains uncertain based on clinical history and routine EEG, an overnight ambulatory EEG or video PSG with full montage should be considered. Video PSG with extended EEG in a sleep laboratory may be preferred if spells are nightly or near nightly in frequency, whereas video EEG in an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit should always be chosen if antiseizure drug discontinuation is necessary, when nocturnal events are more sporadic in frequency, or when there are also daytime spells requiring additional neurophysiologic diagnostic assessment.

Across the lifespan, these syndromes account for about 10 to 15 percent of all epilepsy syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H2714676690\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The propensity for seizures during sleep varies by sleep stage and by seizure localization. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep tends to facilitate epileptiform discharges and seizures, whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is relatively inhibitory. (See <a href=\"#H3000375585\" class=\"local\">'Sleep and epileptogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign (childhood) epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), also known as benign rolandic epilepsy, is one of the more common epilepsy syndromes in childhood and a classic form of pure sleep epilepsy. BECTS and other benign focal epilepsy syndromes of childhood are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-related focal epilepsies have traditionally been named according to the localization of seizure onset. The most common of these is sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), previously called nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE). Nocturnal temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe epilepsies (NTLE, NPLE, and NOLE, respectively) also exist but are less common and have overlapping clinical features with SHE. Peak onset is in adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H2948959093\" class=\"local\">'Nocturnal (sleep-related) focal epilepsies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of sleep-related seizures have significant overlap with parasomnias and other nocturnal motor or behavioral events, and video polysomnography (PSG) with extended electroencephalography (EEG) may be required for full characterization of the events and accurate diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2322537400\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4197330222\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed SHE or other sleep-related focal epilepsy, we suggest initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> or a related drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eslicarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eslicarbazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Supporting evidence for these drugs is largely anecdotal, however, and a number of other antiseizure drugs may be equally reasonable choices based on individual considerations of patient age, gender, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, and comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H1846675154\" class=\"local\">'Selection of antiseizure drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who fail two appropriate antiseizure drugs are considered to have drug-resistant epilepsy and should be referred to a multidisciplinary epilepsy center for consideration of additional medications and nonpharmacologic approaches, including epilepsy surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of drug-resistant epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous remission of SHE and other sleep-related focal epilepsies is rare, and most patients require lifelong antiseizure drug therapy. In addition to antiseizure drug therapy, management includes preventive counseling and education about common seizure precipitants and risks and complications of chronic epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H2855598913\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and indications for referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1863314907\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care and counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Thomas RH, King WH, Johnston JA, Smith PE.
