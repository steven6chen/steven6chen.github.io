Regurgitation associated with prosthetic heart valves includes regurgitation through the valve (transvalvular) as well as paravalvular regurgitation (also known as paravalvular leak). Symptomatic severe prosthetic valve regurgitation is an uncommon complication of surgical valve replacement. However, it is associated with poor outcomes with both conservative management and surgical treatment. </p><p>This topic will discuss clinical manifestations and diagnosis of surgical prosthetic aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. Transcatheter heart valve regurgitation and prognosis and management of surgical prosthetic valve regurgitation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of surgical aortic and mitral prosthetic valve regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2504613584\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally functioning mechanical valves and some normally functioning bioprosthetic valves have trivial to mild transvalvular regurgitation, which should be distinguished from pathological regurgitation. On color Doppler echocardiographic imaging of normally functioning mechanical prosthetic valves, two types of retrograde jets are seen: a closing volume caused by motion of the occluder and true trivial or mild regurgitation at the edges of the occluder. Mechanical prosthetic valves are designed to cause trivial to mild transvalvular regurgitation when functioning normally as a safety mechanism known as leakage backflow or washing jets; this mechanism is thought to reduce the risk of valve thrombosis. Trivial regurgitation is also normal for some types of bioprosthetic valves (particularly stentless valves), due to minimal leaflet retraction once placed. </p><p>The principal types of pathologic prosthetic valve regurgitation are transvalvular regurgitation (due to structural valve deterioration or non-structural valve dysfunction) and paravalvular leakage:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transvalvular regurgitation</strong> &minus; Pathologic transvalvular regurgitation is much more common with bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves. With conventional stented bioprostheses, 10 to 30 percent had significant structural valve deterioration at 10 years, and 20 to 50 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, structural valve deterioration includes both regurgitation and stenosis, and the prevalence of patients with regurgitation is unknown. The rate of structural failure decreases with age, probably in part due to less activity in older patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an additional example, 2659 patients receiving 2758 Carpentier-Edwards aortic valve bioprosthesis (98 required a second bioprosthesis and one required a third) were prospectively followed using clinical and echocardiographic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was defined as development of severe aortic stenosis or severe aortic regurgitation. The numbers of patients with severe aortic regurgitation were not reported. SVD was reported in 157 patients (123 of whom required reintervention) over a cumulative follow-up of 18,404 valve-years. All cases of SVD were late events and actuarial freedom from SVD at 15 and 20 years was 78.6 and 48.5 percent, respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freedom from reoperation for SVD at 15 years was 70.8 percent for patients aged 60 years or less, 82.7 percent for those 60 to 70 years, and 98.1 percent for those over 70 years old. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paravalvular leak</strong> &minus; The incidence of prosthetic paravalvular leak varies widely among registries. However, they are more commonly detected in mechanic valves and in the mitral position. Mitral paravalvular leak can be seen in 7 to 17 percent of implanted valves, while aortic paravalvular leaks occur in 2 to 10 percent of implanted valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H598376316\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2045238334\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of prosthetic valve regurgitation varies depending upon its severity, its hemodynamic effects, and its cause (eg, valve thrombus or vegetations). In asymptomatic patients, prosthetic valve regurgitation may be detected as an incidental finding obtained on routine follow-up while symptomatic patients frequently present with marked symptoms of overt heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H1609925736\" class=\"local\">'Identifying the cause of prosthetic valve regurgitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Many cases of prosthetic valve regurgitation present as an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient, as most patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation have a normally function valve with trivial to mild regurgitation and a benign course without symptoms. However, significant regurgitation can lead to serious clinical consequences and adverse outcomes.</p><p>Among patients with paravalvular leak, the rate of symptomatic regurgitation varies among series between 1 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The rate of symptomatic transvalvular regurgitation is difficult to estimate, as reported structural valve deterioration (SVD) includes both stenotic and regurgitant deterioration, as has been previously discussed. When symptomatic, patients present with heart failure in more than 90 percent of cases, with an average New York Heart Association functional class &gt;III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. </p><p>A change is auscultatory findings, such as a change in prosthetic valve sounds or the appearance of a new murmur, should prompt suspicion of prosthetic valve dysfunction, although such findings have low specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Some cases of prosthetic regurgitation caused by valve thrombosis or vegetations are associated to embolic events. Other clinical manifestations of infection such as fever are commonly present in patients with endocarditis.

On the other hand, hemolysis screening should be performed whenever significant (more than mild) regurgitation is detected. Patients with prosthetic valves commonly have hemolysis caused by shear stress across the prosthesis, more commonly with mechanical valves than with bioprosthetic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, rarely is hemolysis severe enough to cause anemia with new generation normal functioning prosthetic valves (&lt;1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-surgical-aortic-and-mitral-prosthetic-valve-regurgitation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Since significant hemolytic anemia is strongly associated with SVD or the appearance of PVL, pathological regurgitation should be suspected if significant hemolysis occurs.

However, TTE color Doppler assessment of regurgitant jets (particularly with mitral prostheses) is often limited by the presence of acoustic artifacts generated by the prosthesis, which can mask the severity of the regurgitation. The role of TTE in assessing prosthetic regurgitation varies depending upon the valve site and type of regurgitation, as described above.
