CRS can be divided into three subtypes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS without nasal polyposis (CRS without NP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRS with nasal polyposis (CRS with NP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS)</p><p/><p>The diagnosis requires at least two of four cardinal <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> (mucopurulent drainage, nasal obstruction, facial <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/pressure/fullness,</span> and decreased sense of smell). In addition, objective documentation of mucosal inflammation (on imaging or direct visualization) is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are different strategies for treating each subtype. The management of patients with CRS with and without NP will be discussed here. AFRS is discussed in detail separately. The microbiology and antimicrobial therapy of this disorder and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the different types of CRS are also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and antibiotic management of chronic rhinosinusitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-fungal-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRS cannot be &quot;cured&quot; in most patients, and therapy is intended to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. Thus, the goals of CRS therapy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of mucosal inflammation and edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of adequate sinus ventilation and drainage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of colonizing or infecting micro-organisms, if present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in the number of acute exacerbations</p><p/><p>In many respects, management of CRS resembles that of asthma, in which patients are treated initially to reduce symptoms as much as possible and then transitioned to maintenance therapy and followed over time for periodic adjustments in medications and treatment of acute exacerbations. Mucosal remodeling, similar to that believed to occur in severe asthma, has been increasingly studied as a cause of irreversible chronic sinus disease. It is not clear to what extent treatment can slow or prevent this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In keeping with the concept of overlapping pathogenesis involving both the upper and lower airways, medical management of CRS can lead to improvements in asthma control in patients with both disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111178579\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cross-sectional study demonstrated that among patients with CRS (of all types) who stop smoking, each year since cessation is associated with improvements in CRS symptoms, quality of life, and CRS-related use of oral glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The authors estimated that the negative effects of smoking could be expected to resolve 10 to 20 years after cessation. Active smoking also negatively impacts outcomes following functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A general approach to smoking cessation and pharmacologic therapies to assist in smoking cessation are reviewed separately.

They can also diagnose and manage associated otologic problems. Patients with stable CRS who develop changes to suggest a complication of CRS, such as orbital cellulitis, cavernous vein thrombosis, or erosion into the central nervous system, should be urgently evaluated by an otolaryngologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Allergy/immunology</span> specialists can direct medical therapy, diagnose and treat associated allergy, immunodeficiency, and asthma, and perform <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> desensitizations in patients with aspirin intolerance and nasal polyps.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MEDICAL THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple therapies are used in the management of CRS with or without nasal polyposis (NP), including saline washes and sprays, intranasal and systemic glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and antileukotriene agents.</p><p>Most therapies for CRS have not been validated in randomized trials, although a consensus group has identified areas in which trials are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In 2016, several systematic reviews evaluated the main therapies discussed in this review and concluded that the evidence supporting most of them was of low quality, further emphasizing the need for more rigorous research in these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. An overview of each therapy is provided in this section. The subsequent sections describe the specific ways in which these therapies are combined to manage different types of CRS. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'CRS without nasal polyposis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'CRS with nasal polyposis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal saline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irrigating the nasal cavities with saline reduces postnasal drainage, removes secretions, and rinses away allergens and irritants. Saline irrigations can be used immediately prior to administration of other intranasal medications, so that the mucosa is freshly cleansed when the medications are introduced. We encourage patients with CRS to perform nasal irrigation in preference to using saline nasal sprays, based on our clinical impression and limited data that irrigation is the more effective technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/13,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19,20</a>]. A Cochrane analysis of saline irrigation concluded that there is some benefit of daily, large volume (150 mL) saline irrigation with a hypertonic (2 percent) saline solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence was low for three months and very low for six months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A variety of over-the-counter devices, including squeeze bottles, syringes, and pots are available. Patients can make their own saline solutions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71059 \">table 1</a>) or buy commercially prepared products. Nasal lavage (with at least 200 mL warmed saline per side) can be performed as needed only, daily, or multiple times daily, depending on the severity of symptoms. Systematic reviews of studies employing various forms of saline sprays and irrigation (performed one to four times daily) found that nasal saline is an effective adjunctive treatment for CRS, although less effective as monotherapy than intranasal glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. Care should be taken to ensure that the irrigation bottles do not become contaminated. This can be accomplished by periodically microwaving the bottles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97421700\"><span class=\"h3\">Surfactants to disrupt biofilms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of surfactants, such as baby shampoo, to saline irrigations has been proposed to prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms on the sinus mucosa and to increase mucociliary clearance rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. An uncontrolled study examined the effects of a 1 percent solution of baby shampoo in physiologic saline, which was used to irrigate the sinuses twice daily for four weeks in 18 postsurgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Sixty percent of patients reported subjective thinning of mucus and less postnasal drainage. However, no objective measures of mucosal disease or biofilm were measured. Based upon these preliminary findings and in vitro studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], surfactants warrant further study in the management of CRS. The author finds nasal rinses with added baby shampoo may be helpful in reducing the number of symptomatic episodes in a subset of patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2510630687\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral glucocorticoids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, may be administered to patients with CRS for the following purposes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relieving severe and refractory mucosal edema in CRS without NP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing the size of polyps in CRS with NP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing mucosal inflammation in allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS)</p><p/><p>Doses for specific situations are discussed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment of CRS without NP (see <a href=\"#H1813323\" class=\"local\">'Preferred approach: Oral glucocorticoids plus antibiotics'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment of CRS with NP (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Intranasal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intranasal glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of maintenance treatment for many types of rhinitis and have been shown in randomized trials to be helpful as a maintenance therapy for CRS, although a 2016 systematic review rated the overall quality of evidence in CRS specifically as very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/1,14,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,26-31</a>]. These agents remain underprescribed in CRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. They can be administered either as nasal sprays or as solutions for instillation. We typically begin therapy with glucocorticoid nasal sprays. For patients with persistent nasal congestion or blockage despite consistent use of glucocorticoid nasal sprays, we suggest changing to nasal glucocorticoid instillations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal sprays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal glucocorticoid sprays include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclesonide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> dipropionate, and fluticasone furoate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55833 \">table 2</a>).

There is no compelling evidence that any one agent is more effective than another or that sprays are more or less effective than aerosol products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Intranasal glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>To optimize effectiveness and patient compliance with nasal sprays, we suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparations with once daily dosing are convenient and can help optimize compliance.

In addition, they should avoid pointing the tip of the bottle at the septum to minimize septum irritation and bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Instillations/drops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instillation of glucocorticoid solutions into the nose can reach the middle meatus (where polyps often form) more reliably than nasal sprays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In the United Kingdom and some areas of Europe, solutions of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate are commercially available as nasal drops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Lesser concentrations can be made, such as 250 mcg in 7 mL volume, depending on what is deemed most appropriate for the patient. To instill the concentrated budesonide rinse into the nostril, a syringe with a specialized nasal tip is very helpful.

The active treatment resulted in significant improvement in the primary outcomes of reduction in polyp size and subjective symptoms. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression based on morning plasma cortisol over the two weeks of the study, although the short duration of active treatment could have minimized such an effect. It is noteworthy that this study used a dose of budesonide (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/nostril/day)</span> and concentration (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> versus 71.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> higher than typically employed by the author for nasal instillation.

Clues to the presence of infection in such a patient include the presence of facial pain, the presence of an air fluid level on sinus computed tomography (CT) scan, or the presence of purulent mucus in the middle meatus. This strategy has the advantage of treating infection, while simultaneously reducing polypoid mucosal thickening to promote drainage of infected mucus.

There was no polyp regrowth in 79 and 38 percent of the furosemide and placebo groups, respectively. No improvement in sinus CT scores was observed during furosemide treatment relative to placebo treatment. Furosemide treatment was well-tolerated with no important adverse effects. The effects appear to be local rather than systemic, consistent with the very low daily dose of furosemide and the lack of detectable impact on extent of disease on sinus CT. However, additional trials should be performed to determine the longer-term efficacy and safety of topical furosemide, optimal dosing, and how much incremental benefit it would provide relative to conventional doses of glucocorticoid sprays (ie, two <span class=\"nowrap\">sprays/nostril</span> daily) of fluticasone propionate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate.

Omalizumab also improved airway symptoms (nasal congestion, anterior rhinorrhea, loss of sense of smell, wheezing, and dyspnea) and quality of life scores.

Although BCS can be used to restore patency to the maxillary, sphenoid, or frontal sinuses, studies in children have focused on restoring patency to the maxillary sinus. The procedure appears to be safe and to result in significant improvement in symptoms beyond that afforded by adenoidectomy alone but comparable in magnitude with that previously published from adenoidectomy plus maxillary lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. One study compared BCS with ethmoidectomy to FESS and reported similar overall results in both groups but less postoperative use of antibiotics in the BCS with the ethmoidectomy group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4150686668\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical adjuncts to sinus surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several medical treatments have been developed as adjuncts to sinus surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164360243\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid-eluting sinus implants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mometasone-eluting sinus implants are approved by the FDA to maintain the patency of the ethmoid or frontal sinus openings following endoscopic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>]. The approved implants deliver 370 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate from a biodegradable, bioabsorbable polymer matrix over 30 days. Several published studies and a meta-analysis have examined the utility of these devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/140-144\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-144</a>]. The meta-analysis included two randomized trials with a total of 143 patients and found that drug-eluting implants, compared with nondrug implants, significantly reduced postoperative interventions, lysis of adhesions, and the need for oral glucocorticoids by 35, 51, and 40 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Another study demonstrated that the implants could be inserted in-office into the ethmoid cavity for treatment of recurrent polyposis following endoscopic sinus surgery with resultant reduction in NP size, ethmoid sinus obstruction, and improvement in nasal obstruction symptom scores achieved for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H671071911\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid-impregnated nasal dressing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another method of delivery of intranasal glucocorticoid therapy is glucocorticoid-impregnated dressing, although evidence in support of this approach is less robust. In a retrospective, case control study, 21 subjects with recurrent polypoid changes following surgery underwent placement of triamcinolone-impregnated (total dose 20 mg) absorbable nasal dressings in the middle meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].

Compared with a control group of patients treated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (24 mg initially, gradually reduced over six days and discontinued), improvements were similar at four and eight weeks. This approach represents another method of delivery of intranasal glucocorticoid therapy, which should achieve high local concentrations while minimizing systemic exposure. The assistance of an otolaryngologist is required, and this technique should be studied further to better define optimal dose, duration of benefit, and patient selection. In a separate study using 20 mg per side of triamcinolone-impregnated dressings (equivalent to a daily dose of 17 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> orally), serum cortisol was suppressed at day 2 after placement but had normalized by day 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3436615212\"><span class=\"h3\">Macrolide antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few studies have examined the utility of macrolide antibiotics following sinus surgery for different types of CRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-rhinosinusitis-management/abstract/148,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">148,149</a>].

In most cases, the disorder cannot be cured, and the goal of therapy is to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple therapies are utilized in the management of CRS, including intranasal saline, intranasal and systemic glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and antileukotriene agents. These are combined in various ways to manage specific subtypes of CRS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview of medical therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">CRS without nasal polyposis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with untreated CRS without nasal polyposis (NP) who are seeking symptomatic relief, we suggest initial therapy with oral glucocorticoids <strong>plus</strong> oral antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A typical regimen includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (in adults, 20 mg twice daily for five days, followed by 20 mg daily for five days) <strong>plus</strong> three to four weeks of an antibiotic. Empiric antibiotic regimens for CRS are discussed separately. Antibiotics may be extended for up to six weeks (or seven days after symptoms have cleared) in patients with colored secretions that are improving gradually but have not cleared completely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and antibiotic management of chronic rhinosinusitis&quot;, section on 'Empiric regimens'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One or more adjunctive therapies (intranasal glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intranasal saline) are usually administered concomitantly. (See <a href=\"#H1813323\" class=\"local\">'Preferred approach: Oral glucocorticoids plus antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial therapy for CRS without NP must be followed by maintenance therapy because without ongoing treatment, symptoms will eventually return in most patients. For maintenance therapy, we suggest intranasal glucocorticoid nasal sprays (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with persistent or increasing symptoms despite consistent use of glucocorticoid sprays, we suggest changing to glucocorticoid instillations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78384\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78384 \">figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with underlying allergic rhinitis who have sneezing or nasal pruritus may benefit from additional therapies targeting that condition, including nonsedating second-generation antihistamines, antileukotriene agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allergen immunotherapy.

These individuals often have a history of pneumonia or recurrent otitis, in addition to sinus disease. (See <a href=\"#H1813136833\" class=\"local\">'Patients with immunodeficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">CRS with nasal polyposis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CRS with NP who are seeking relief of nasal blockage or an impaired sense of smell, we recommend a course of oral glucocorticoids initially to shrink nasal polyps (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A typical adult regimen is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 20 mg twice daily for five days, 10 mg twice daily for five days, and then 10 mg daily for five days. Very severe polyps may not respond adequately and may require subsequent surgical debulking. Without follow-up therapy, the benefit of this intervention is temporary. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be difficult to determine if concomitant bacterial infection is present in patients with newly diagnosed CRS with NP, and we favor empiric antibiotic treatment concomitantly with oral glucocorticoids. We suggest three to four weeks of oral antibiotics for previously untreated patients with facial pain, the presence of an air fluid level on sinus computed tomography (CT) scan, or the presence of purulent mucus in the middle meatus (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Empiric antibiotic regimens are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-antibiotic-management-of-chronic-rhinosinusitis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and antibiotic management of chronic rhinosinusitis&quot;, section on 'Empiric regimens'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild CRS with NP (ie, nasal patency and an intact sense of smell) and for maintenance therapy after initial treatment with oral glucocorticoids and antibiotics, we suggest intranasal glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We advise patients to use nasal sprays initially, but if symptoms worsen despite consistent use, we change this to nasal instillations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78384\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78384 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Intranasal glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CRS with NP whose symptoms are not adequately controlled on maintenance treatment with intranasal glucocorticoids (sprays or instillations), nonsedating antihistamines and antileukotriene agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>) may provide some added benefit. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Antileukotriene agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with CRS with NP also have asthma and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) intolerance, a condition called aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). We suggest aspirin desensitization and daily aspirin therapy for these patients, provided they have no contraindications to aspirin therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This intervention requires access to an allergy specialist with experience in drug desensitizations.
