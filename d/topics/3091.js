Most are either intrasellar or suprasellar. Approximately 50 percent present clinically during childhood and adolescence, the other 50 percent present after age 20 years, some not until age 70 or 80 years.

Rathke's cleft cysts, the most common, are benign cysts derived from remnants of Rathke's pouch, the same structure from which craniopharyngiomas arise (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=craniopharyngioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Craniopharyngioma&quot;</a>). The clinical characteristics of all are similar. Most cysts are small and discovered incidentally by MRI. The MRI characteristics include a sellar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suprasellar, symmetrical, round or ovoid mass that enhances on either T1 or T2-weighted images but does not concentrate gadolinium. Larger cysts may cause headaches, visual impairment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior pituitary hormonal deficiencies. Rarely, they bleed, causing apoplexy, or rupture, causing aseptic meningitis. The natural history is variable. Of 75 patients with Rathke's cleft cysts followed for a median of 24 months, 57 percent had no change in size, 28 percent increased, and 15 percent decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pituitary abscesses, which are rare, can occur in a normal or diseased pituitary gland.

The most common complaint is diminished vision in the temporal fields (bitemporal hemianopsia). One or both eyes may be affected and, if both, to variable degrees. Diminished visual acuity occurs when the optic chiasm is more severely compressed. Other patterns of visual loss can also occur. Thus, an intrasellar lesion should be suspected when there is any unexplained pattern of visual loss.</p><p>The onset of the visual deficit is usually so gradual that many patients do not seek ophthalmologic consultation for months or even years.

Certain MRI findings suggest a greater likelihood of some kinds of sellar masses than others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As an example, a mass that is separate from the pituitary gland generally indicates that the mass is not a pituitary adenoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56435\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56435 \">image 1</a>). However, no finding is usually pathognomonic of any one kind of mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63618\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63618 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600539362\"><span class=\"h4\">Unenhanced image</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal pituitary tissue and most sellar lesions, pituitary adenomas, and other tumors, have a signal that is similar to or slightly greater in intensity than that of central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Cystic lesions, such as Rathke's cleft cysts, often have a low-intensity signal on T1-weighted images; however, craniopharyngiomas and even pituitary adenomas may be partially cystic and, therefore, have low-intensity signals. Furthermore, the signal intensity on T1-weighted images will be high if the protein or lipid concentration of the cyst fluid is high. On T2-weighted images, cystic lesions may have a high-intensity signal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76412\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76412 \">image 3</a>). Hemorrhage into the pituitary gland results in a high-intensity signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images.</p><p>Meningiomas typically have a brighter and more homogeneous signal than pituitary adenomas. They also have a suprasellar rather than a sellar epicenter and a dural-based attachment best seen after contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600539373\"><span class=\"h4\">Gadolinium-enhanced image</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal pituitary tissue takes up gadolinium to a greater degree than CNS tissue and therefore has a higher-intensity signal than the surrounding CNS. Both micro- and macroadenomas of the pituitary (as well as other sellar masses such as craniopharyngiomas and meningiomas) usually take up gadolinium to a lesser degree than the normal pituitary but more than the CNS. Therefore, the degree of gadolinium enhancement does not distinguish one kind of sellar mass from another. The postcontrast enhancement of meningiomas is usually homogeneous. If a sellar lesion can be seen as separate from the normal pituitary, whether on unenhanced or, more commonly, enhanced images, the lesion is not a pituitary adenoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56435\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56435 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Among patients with moderate to advanced renal failure (dialysis-dependent or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> the administration of gadolinium has been associated with the potentially severe syndrome of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In such patients, gadolinium-based imaging should be avoided if possible. This issue, as well as the role of hemodialysis after the procedure if gadolinium-based imaging must be performed, is discussed separately.

The possibility of hormone excess should be evaluated to detect the presence of functioning pituitary adenomas. We therefore suggest measurements of serum prolactin (lactotroph adenomas), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (somatotroph adenomas), and 24-hour urinary free cortisol (corticotroph adenomas).</p><p>Additional endocrine testing is needed when a gonadotroph or thyrotroph adenoma is suspected (luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], total or free thyroxine [T4], and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], respectively). Testing of alpha subunit is needed when either type of adenoma is suspected.
