Its prevalence in the population increases with age, and it is estimated to affect over 4 percent of the population above the age of 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Paroxysmal AF (PAF), also termed intermittent AF, is defined as an episode of AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention in less than seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. &quot;Persistent,&quot; &quot;longstanding persistent,&quot; and &quot;permanent&quot; are clinical labels used for the other types of AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This definition applies to recurrent intermittent episodes of AF that are unrelated to a reversible cause. If the AF is secondary to pericarditis, hyperthyroidism, pulmonary embolism, or other reversible causes, therapy is directed toward the underlying disease as well as the AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The frequency of PAF is uncertain, because older studies have suggested that a majority of these episodes are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], including some that may last more than 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>This topic will address the ways in which patients with PAF differ from the broad population of patients with AF. However, in many instances, patients with PAF are managed in a manner similar to those with more sustained forms of AF. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1696500\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms secondary to atrial fibrillation (AF) are broad. The most common complaints include irregular palpitations, often in the setting of worsening shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a sensation of lightheadedness. Other symptoms include more general complaints such as fatigue, weakness, or generalized malaise. The severity and extent of symptoms are often dictated by the patient&rsquo;s underlying cardiac condition, age, and rapidity and regularity of the ventricular response. In patients with co-existing congestive heart failure, worsening heart failure may result from loss of atrial contraction as well as the rapid ventricular response rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Effect on cardiac function'</a>.) </p><p>In patients with underlying coronary artery disease, the rapid ventricular rate may precipitate angina, which could present as an acute coronary syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-non-acute-management-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the non-acute management of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>An occasional patient may present with syncope after conversion to sinus rhythm. The mechanism may be attributed to a prolonged sinus pause.</p><p>In some situations, there may be ischemic electrocardiogram changes as well as an increase in cardiac biomarkers, which would be considered &ldquo;demand ischemia.&rdquo; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-cardiac-troponin-concentration-in-the-absence-of-an-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated cardiac troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On physical examination, there may be a slight variation in the intensity of the first heart sound in the setting of an irregularly irregular pulse. Since atrial contraction is lost, S4 sounds are not heard and jugular venous &ldquo;a&rdquo; waves are absent. Variations in cuff blood pressure readings are also common during AF due to changes in the beat-to-beat cadence and changes in left ventricular filling and stroke volume. It is often necessary to measure the blood pressure multiple times and average these values to obtain a more accurate blood pressure reading. Lastly, an apical-radial pulse deficit can be observed in patients in AF. When one assesses the apical pulse rate and the radial pulse rate simultaneously, one will appreciate that the radial heart rate is less than the apical heart rate. Since the heart rate is irregular, some ventricular contractions will occur preceded by shorter periods of diastole in which there is a reduction in left ventricular filling. This will necessarily result in episodes where there is insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave to the arm.</p><p>The relationship between subclinical AF and cryptogenic stroke is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke#H2560277323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;, section on 'Occult atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for developing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are similar to those associated with sustained atrial fibrillation and include age, hypertension, structural heart disease including valve disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors that precipitate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), particularly in patients without apparent structural heart disease, are incompletely understood but are thought to be secondary to the presence of atrial premature beats (APBs) and alterations in autonomic nervous system dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial premature beats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies in which Holter monitoring was performed have shown that the majority of episodes of PAF are triggered by APBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In fact, the more APBs present, the higher the risk of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A small number of PAF episodes can also be preceded by typical atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, or even paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. APBs most often originate from near the ostia of the pulmonary veins, occurring in 89 and 94 percent of cases in two series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Less commonly, foci have also been described to occur in the <span class=\"nowrap\">right/left</span> atria, the vein of Marshall, and the superior vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>]. The importance of the pulmonary veins in the genesis of PAF is further illustrated by the beneficial effect of pulmonary vein isolation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>APBs appear to be most important as a trigger in patients with PAF who have structurally normal or near-normal hearts. However, it is unclear if modification of the APB burden can reduce AF risk. The relative importance of APBs or other triggers versus an abnormal substrate is much less clear in patients with significant structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autonomic nervous system may be involved, as both increased vagal (parasympathetic) and sympathetic tone can promote the development of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Increased sympathetic tone has been referred to as the adrenergic form of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Vagal tone is predominant in normal hearts at rest, which may explain why vagally-mediated AF commonly occurs at night or in the early morning. It may also explain why it is often seen in athletic young men without apparent heart disease who have slow heart rates during rest or sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].</p><p>Acetylcholine and increased vagal tone result in a shortening of atrial myocardial refractory period. However, vagal innervation of the atria is heterogeneous. As a result, the induction of AF by vagal stimulation may result from shortening of the atrial refractory period in only some areas of the atrial myocardium, thus producing heterogeneity of atrial refractoriness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Vagal stimulation and the associated hypotension may on occasion contribute to the development of syncope in association with episodes of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Increased sympathetic tone, which also shortens atrial myocardial refractory period and increases atrial myocardial conduction velocity, may be associated with AF occurring in patients with underlying heart disease and during exercise or other activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, AF during exercise is a rare event; in a retrospective review of 3000 exercise tests, there were only four episodes of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Sympathetic stimulation has also been suggested as the cause for AF associated with hyperthyroidism and coronary artery bypass graft surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of autonomic dysfunction as a trigger for PAF in these patients has not been well studied. In a report from the European Heart Survey on AF, 1517 patients with PAF were categorized according to trigger pattern: adrenergic, vagal, or both (6, 15, and 12 percent of the total group, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The was no significant difference in the prevalence of the different kinds of underlying heart disease (heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or hypertension) among groups.</p><p>The adrenergic trigger pattern was defined as follows: initiated by exercise or emotion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> present mainly during daytime without reported vagal triggers. Patients were classified in the vagal group if AF occurred postprandially <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> was present during the night only without presence of any adrenergic triggers. Patients were classified in the mixed AF group when a combination of at least one adrenergic and one vagal trigger was present. </p><p>In a report of patients referred for radiofrequency ablation due to symptomatic drug refractory PAF, the prevalence of vagal, adrenergic, or other AF was found 27, 7, and 66 percent of the time, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There is no evidence, except in CABG patients in the perioperative period, that selection of therapy based upon the type of autonomic dysfunction improves outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence of AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) suggests that episodes will continue but with variable frequency. The incidence in different reports has ranged from 70 percent at one year (without antiarrhythmic therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] to 90 percent at four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] to 60 to 65 percent at five to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. These estimates almost certainly represent an underestimate, since a majority of episodes are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], including some that last more than 48 hours; such prolonged asymptomatic episodes occurred in 17 percent of patients in a report using continuous monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The latter study also showed that 40 percent of patients had episodes of AF-like symptoms in the absence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) trial evaluated 341 patients with intermittent AF who were followed for 26 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. During this time, 49 percent had recurrent AF documented on at least one electrocardiogram. There were 104 additional patients who underwent cardioversion (electric or pharmacologic); the recurrence rate during follow-up was 54 percent in this group.</p><p>The report from SPAF also provided insight into clinical and echocardiographic factors that predict recurrence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When compared to patients without a recurrence of AF, patients with any AF recurrence were more likely to have heart failure (17 versus 8 percent) or a prior myocardial infarction (15 versus 5 percent). Echocardiographic factors associated with AF recurrence included moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction (12 versus 3 percent in those without recurrence) and larger left atrial diameter. Compared to a normal left atrial diameter of less than 4.0 cm, the relative risk of recurrent AF was 1.6 with a left atrial diameter between 4.1 and 5.0 cm and 4.5 above 5.0 cm.</p><p>These risk factors are similar to those for recurrence after cardioversion to sinus rhythm in patients with permanent AF. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression to persistent or permanent AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, PAF spontaneously reverts to sinus rhythm within seven days of onset. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The percent of patients with PAF who progress to persistent or permanent AF increases with time. In different reports, the rate of progression to permanent AF was 8, 12, 18, and 25 percent at one, two, four, and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In a 2016 registry report, about 36 percent of patients with paroxysmal AF had progressed to persistent AF within 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A number of studies have attempted to identify predictors of progression to persistent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In the report from SPAF cited above, the following differences were noted between the patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PAF were less likely to have hypertension or heart failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On echocardiography, patients with PAF had a smaller left atrial diameter (4.3 versus 4.8 cm), were less likely to have a diameter greater than 5.0 cm (11 versus 34 percent), and were less likely to have moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction (6 versus 18 percent). For every 1 cm increase in left ventricular systolic dimension, there was a 1.8-fold greater risk of developing persistent AF.</p><p/><p>The transition from PAF to persistent AF also depends upon the underlying etiology for the arrhythmia. Progression has been reported in approximately 66 percent of patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, 40 percent with hypertension, and 27 percent with ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. </p><p>Increasing age also predicts increased risk for the development of persistent AF. The hazard ratio for progression in two reports was 1.41 to 1.82 for each 10-year increase in age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of embolization in patients with PAF is discussed separately.

This classification applies to episodes of AF that last more than 30 seconds and that are unrelated to a reversible cause. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)<br/><br/>If the AF is secondary to cardiac surgery, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, hyperthyroidism, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary disease, or other reversible causes, therapy is directed toward the underlying disease as well as the AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recurrence rate of AF is high in patients who present with PAF. The incidence in different reports has ranged from 70 percent at one year (without antiarrhythmic therapy) to 90 percent at four years to 60 to 65 percent at five to six years. These estimates almost certainly represent an underestimation of the true incidence. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The percent of patients with PAF who progress to persistent or permanent AF increases with time. In different reports, the rate of progression to permanent AF was 8, 12, 18, and 25 percent at one, two, four, and five years, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Progression to persistent or permanent AF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of embolization with frequent and prolonged episodes of PAF may be similar to the risk in patients with persistent or permanent AF. However, data are not conclusive. We suggest an approach to antithrombotic therapy similar to that in the broad group of patients with AF, although recommendations should be individualized to the specific patient.(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Risk of embolization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of the arrhythmia in patients with PAF is similar to that for the general population of patients with AF.
