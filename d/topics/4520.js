Agitated saline contrast provides contrast in the right heart and enables detection of right-to-left shunts. Opacification of the left ventricular (LV) cavity by contrast agents developed to traverse the pulmonary vasculature permits improved left ventricular endocardial border detection, thus improving the assessment of left ventricular dimensions and wall motion. Contrast echocardiography can also enhance delineation of Doppler signal. Additional uses of contrast echocardiography include assessment of myocardial perfusion.</p><p>The current and potential clinical applications of this technique will be reviewed here. The development and safety of microbubbles for echocardiographic contrast and the optimization of the echocardiographic settings for visualizing contrast are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Contrast agents, safety, and imaging technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR AGITATED SALINE CONTRAST</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Shunt detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first clinical use of contrast echocardiography was for detection of right-to-left shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Agitated saline is well-suited for this purpose because microbubbles of air formed from agitating saline persist long enough to opacify the right heart chambers and diffuse into the lungs when traveling through the pulmonary circulation. Therefore, microbubbles will not gain access to the left heart chambers unless a right-to-left intracardiac or extracardiac shunt is present.</p><p>This technique is used most often for the detection of atrial septal defects, although it can also be used to detect ventricular septal defects and arteriovenous shunts in the pulmonary vasculature. The appearance of bubbles in the left heart early (within three to five beats) after right chamber opacification suggests an intracardiac shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Later appearance of bubbles in the left heart suggests pulmonary arteriovenous shunting.

This venous anomaly is usually detected incidentally. A persistent left SVC is suspected when a dilated coronary sinus is detected in the absence of a cause for elevated right atrial pressure. A persistent left superior vena cava drains directly into the coronary sinus leading to a characteristic sequence of contrast appearance: following injection of contrast into a left arm vein, contrast appears in the coronary sinus before appearing in the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Upon intravenous injection of contrast into the right arm, there is normal transit of contrast with right atrial opacification before appearance of contrast in the coronary sinus.</p><p>Associated cardiovascular anomalies are present in a minority of patients with persistent left SVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Associated venous anomalies include absence of the innominate vein and more rarely absence of the right superior vena cava or drainage of the left SVC into the left atrium.</p><p>The presence of a left SVC may complicate transvenous placement of pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheters, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads, as well as retrograde cardioplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR MICROBUBBLE CONTRAST AGENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocardial border definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second generation microbubble contrast agents (Definity, Optison, and Lumason, which are available in most countries) traverse the pulmonary vasculature and are indicated for LV opacification and LV endocardial border definition in patients with technically suboptimal echocardiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].

Contrast opacification of the LV cavity enhances border detection, decreasing the variability in the interpretation of regional wall motion abnormalities, LV volumes and remodeling, and the ejection fraction (EF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55017\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55017 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].

Although Albunex was the first agent to produce LV opacification from an intravenous injection, it produced LV opacification only 64 to 81 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/7,8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,17</a>].

Improved sensitivity with contrast echocardiography, as compared with conventional stress imaging, has led many laboratories to routinely use contrast during stress imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Echocardiographic contrast administration during stress echocardiography is commonly performed to better define endocardial borders in patients with suboptimal echocardiographic images (to enhance the detection of wall motion abnormalities). Additionally, the administration of echocardiographic contrast can be performed for the concurrent assessment of myocardial perfusion. When perfusion imaging is combined with contrast assessment of wall motion abnormalities, the process is typically referred to as real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography (RTMCE).</p><p>The efficacy of contrast echocardiography for the assessment of wall motion abnormalities was evaluated in a retrospective multicenter study of 4011 patients undergoing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography for evaluation of suspected coronary heart disease (CHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All patients received Definity or Optison for rest and peak stress imaging. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy for detection of significant CHD (defined as &gt;50 percent coronary artery stenosis by quantitative angiography) was compared with that obtained in 1923 matched patients with optimal images on stress echocardiography without use of contrast. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were slightly but not significantly higher in the group receiving contrast (81 versus 73 percent and 82 versus 77 percent).</p><p><br/>RTMCE has been studied in a number of prospective cohorts, in comparison with both standard contrast stress echocardiography (assessing wall motion only) and myocardial perfusion imaging, and has generally been as good or better than other imaging techniques for the diagnosis of obstructive CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. As an example, in a prospective randomized comparison of RTMCE and standard contrast stress echocardiography among 2063 patients (mean age 59 years, 53 percent female) referred for stress echocardiography for suspected CHD, RTMCE identified more resting wall motion abnormalities (13 versus 9 percent) as well as significantly more abnormal stress tests (30 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. RTMCE improved the detection of CHD compared with standard contrast stress echocardiography.</p><p>Preliminary data suggest that stress echocardiography may provide an advantage over radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) in women by overcoming the problem of nuclear image attenuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Small studies found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography had similar sensitivity and similar or greater specificity as compared with rMPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Contrast LV opacification may further improve diagnostic accuracy, although this has not been directly compared with rMPI in women.

Since these agents pass into the left heart, they can be used to enhance right heart (tricuspid) or left heart (mitral or aortic) signals for evaluation of diastolic or valvular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol septal ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast echocardiography can be used to guide alcohol septal ablation used as a treatment to diminish LV outflow obstruction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Injection of echocardiographic contrast agent into the proposed target septal arteries to determine the territory supplied by them is key to the success of the procedure, as defined by at least a 50 percent reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. After the target septal perforator is identified, a balloon catheter is advanced into the vessel and inflated. One to 2 mL of a diluted echocardiographic contrast agent is injected through the balloon catheter during continuous echocardiographic imaging. A well-demarcated area with increased echodensity in the basal septum will be noted on echocardiographic imaging. It is important to ensure the absence of perfusion of other myocardial segments away from the targeted areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If other areas are noted to be involved, this may lead to a change in the target vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) can accurately delineate the size of the septal vascular territory prior to ethanol injection and can predict the infarct size that results from ethanol infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-nonpharmacologic-treatment-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Nonpharmacologic treatment of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction&quot;, section on 'Alcohol (ethanol) septal ablation'</a>.)</p><p>Optison (as well as Levovist and Albunex, which are no longer available) has been used for this purpose. However, the intra-arterial injection of contrast agents (Optison, Definity, and Lumason) remains contraindicated by FDA regulations. The use of agitated radiographic contrast was suggested in the 2008 ASE guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The 2011 ASE&nbsp;clinical&nbsp;recommendations&nbsp;for&nbsp;multimodality cardiovascular imaging&nbsp;of&nbsp;patients&nbsp;with&nbsp;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy do endorse the use of MCE during alcohol septal ablation, and list the following advantages: shorter intervention time, shorter fluoroscopy time, fewer occluded vessels, smaller amount of ethanol used, smaller infarct size, lower likelihood of heart block, and higher likelihood of success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portable real-time, noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion may become possible with improved contrast echocardiography agents and detection algorithms. Since microbubble size is consistently smaller than erythrocyte size (10 microns), contrast reliably transverses the microvasculature.</p><p>Early studies with intracoronary contrast injections found that contrast echocardiography compared favorably with established perfusion techniques, such as nuclear scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. However, such studies required aortic root or intracoronary contrast injections as well as significant post-processing, thereby preventing immediate clinical application.</p><p>Controlled investigations with newer, second generation agents have shown that routine intravenous injection accurately identifies myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Among patients with coronary artery disease, studies have found a variable correlation between contrast echocardiography and regional tracer uptake in nuclear single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, which were probably due to the need for continued improvement and refinement of acquisition techniques with perfusion imaging and inexperience of the investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The largest multicenter study included 516 patients, each of whom underwent coronary angiography, SPECT examination, and MCE using SonoVue. Both SPECT and MCE were blindly interpreted by three separate experts, while angiograms were assessed quantitatively. Thirty-one percent of patients had &gt;70 percent stenosis. MCE yielded superior sensitivity (75 versus 49 percent) to SPECT but inferior specificity (52 versus 81 percent, respectively). Similar results were obtained in subgroup analyses (single versus multivessel disease, prior myocardial infarction, proximal disease, 50 percent stenosis). The three experts showed only a fair degree of agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In some studies, real-time MCE obtained during exercise or vasodilator correlated well with SPECT imaging, including localization of the vascular territory involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p>Other possible settings in which information concerning the extent of coronary artery disease derived from contrast echocardiography may be clinically useful include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the degree of myocardial opacification in contrast echocardiography correlates with the blood volume in specific vascular beds, the severity and extent of ischemia may be quantifiable, possibly providing prognostic value (as is already demonstrated by nuclear perfusion techniques) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/32,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast echocardiography myocardial perfusion may provide parallel information to that provided with an intracoronary Doppler flow wire or nuclear perfusion imaging (but possibly more easily obtainable) by quantifying flow changes in response to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]; such changes may be identified as differences in contrast intensity.

In addition, echocardiography provides wall motion information that further identifies chest pain patients at high risk for ischemia.

In one study of 50 patients with a first myocardial infarction who received thrombolytic therapy, the presence of reduced opacification on contrast echocardiography, performed on day two, predicted a higher major cardiac event rate (death, nonfatal infarction, or admission for congestive heart failure) during a mean follow-up of 22 months (28 versus 4 percent in those with adequate opacification) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In a second study, patients with a persistent defect in the infarct zone due to the no-reflow phenomenon, despite the restoration of TIMI grade 3 flow, had a deterioration of regional and global systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].<br/><br/>Contrast echocardiography also may enhance the predictive value of standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography. The potential value of this approach was illustrated in a retrospective study of 788 patients who underwent dobutamine stress with injection of microbubbles for real-time contrast echocardiography; 75 patients (9.6 percent) died or had a nonfatal MI at follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Abnormal myocardial perfusion added significant incremental predictive value to clinical factors, the resting LVEF, and wall motion abnormalities. The three-year event-free survival was 95 percent in patients with normal wall motion and myocardial perfusion, 82 percent with normal wall motion and abnormal myocardial perfusion, and 68 percent for abnormalities in both wall motion and myocardial perfusion. Three-year event-free survival varied with multivessel perfusion defects (56 versus 85 percent with a single vessel perfusion defect). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MCE can be used to assess the location and structural and functional responses of the microvasculature to angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Current techniques used to determine myocardial viability include SPECT imaging, positron emission tomography scanning, nuclear magnetic imaging, and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dobutamine stress echocardiography in the evaluation of hibernating myocardium&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging in coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By providing simultaneous LV function and perfusion information via a single modality, contrast echocardiography offers the advantages of improved image resolution (over SPECT), portability, cost economy, and practicality. The threshold of flow detectable with contrast echocardiography is comparable to the level of flow necessary to maintain viability (15 percent of normal or 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per kg), thereby providing a rationale for contrast echocardiography as a potential tool to identify viable myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The identification of subnormal flow (heterogeneous contrast effect) as opposed to no flow (fixed contrast defect) or normal flow (homogeneous contrast) within dysfunctional myocardium may predict long-term recovery of function following the restoration of normal blood supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Stunned myocardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysfunctional segments of the LV following an ischemic insult may represent either infarcted or stunned tissue. Contrast echocardiography may be helpful in differentiating these two patterns of myocardial dysfunction. Stunned myocardium has homogeneous myocardial contrast, representing normal blood flow with an intact microvasculature. Such a pattern implies either that the decrease in perfusion was not lethal or that reperfusion (either spontaneous or as a result of intervention) occurred prior to necrosis. In this setting, systolic function is likely to return over the next several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. In one study of 96 patients with recent myocardial infarction, the positive and negative predictive value of homogeneous opacification for recovery of contractile function at six months was 47 and 84 percent, respectively; the positive predictive value for predicting functional recovery was 78 percent in those who were revascularized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-syndromes-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical syndromes of stunned or hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of complete reperfusion, the identification of heterogeneous contrast effect within dysfunctional segments may represent collateral or partial anterograde blood supply within an area at risk; this also provides important prognostic information by predicting a more limited infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Hibernating myocardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hibernation is the metabolic adaptation and downregulation that occurs following a chronic ischemic insult. As with stunned myocardium, necrotic transformation is avoided and microvascular integrity is maintained, but blood flow and systolic function remain suboptimal. In this setting, findings obtained via contrast echocardiography may be informative. As an example, when myocardial contrast (which was representative of collateral flow) was present in one study, myocardial dysfunction within an infarct zone improved to a greater degree following revascularization than when collateral flow could not be demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The degree of contrast homogeneity may be proportional to the extent of functional recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of stunned or hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the detection of hibernating myocardium, contrast echocardiography compares well to both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography and thallium scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/69-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-74</a>]. In one study, 20 patients with coronary disease and ventricular dysfunction underwent MCE, dobutamine echocardiography, and rest-redistribution thallium scintigraphy prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Echocardiography was repeated three to four months after surgery. The sensitivity of MCE in detecting segments with recovery of function after surgery was comparable to that of dobutamine echocardiography or thallium scintigraphy (90, 80, and 92 percent, respectively), and the specificity was significantly greater (63, 54, and 45 percent, respectively).

One study of 348 patients found two different patterns of intracavitary contrast flow, as visualized in apical views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A swift, vertical, and homogeneous flow towards the apex; 91 percent of patients with this pattern had normal LV segmental function and 93 percent had normal global LV function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58747\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58747 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A distinctly protracted, swirling, and heterogeneous pattern; 99 percent of patients with this pattern had one or more wall motion abnormality and 83 percent had various degrees of LV dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79846\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79846 \">image 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Local drug delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Utilizing known ultrasonic destruction of microbubbles, local drug delivery of agents (contained within the shell) could be performed with well-controlled end-organ targeting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].
