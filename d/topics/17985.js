Infants who have been discharged from the nursery to home and have TB levels that are approaching threshold values for exchange transfusion are also initially treated with phototherapy. If TB remains above the threshold TB level for exchange transfusion after six hours of phototherapy, then exchange transfusion is indicated (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Exchange transfusion'</a> below). This approach reduces the number of infants requiring an invasive exchange transfusion, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. </p><p>As a result, exchange transfusion is typically reserved for symptomatic infants, those with severe hyperbilirubinemia, and infants at risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia who fail to respond adequately to phototherapy. Upon admission, a type and cross-match of the infant's blood and placement of umbilical catheter are performed promptly, so that exchange transfusion can be started as quickly as possible. Urgent and intense phototherapy (referred to as crash cart phototherapy) is provided during the interim time period needed to set up for the procedure. Infants who are close or meet the criteria for exchange transfusion should be directly admitted or transferred to the neonatal or pediatric intensive care unit <span class=\"nowrap\">(NICU/PICU)</span>. Referral should not be through an emergency department (ED) because this delays the initiation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In term neonates, <span class=\"nowrap\">B/A</span> ratio &gt;7.0 (bilirubin <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to albumin <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> indicates that all bilirubin binding sites on albumin are occupied.

In preterm infants, additional confounding factors may affect the ability of albumin to bind bilirubin making it more challenging to predict their bilirubin binding capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Phototherapy has been considered a safe intervention based upon its extensive use in millions of infants and only rare reports of significant toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there is increasing concern that phototherapy may be overprescribed and there may be long-term adverse risks (albeit small) associated with its use (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below).

Overall, 23 percent of patients received phototherapy within eight hours after reaching a TB level within 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (51 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) phototherapy threshold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56490\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56490 \">figure 3</a>). Only 1.6 percent (354 infants) ever exceeded the AAP exchange threshold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68219 \">figure 4</a>), and only three received exchange transfusions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that lower GA and birth weight (BW), younger age at the time TB level reaches the phototherapy threshold, and a positive DAT were associated with an increased risk of reaching the AAP exchange transfusion threshold. Based upon these results, phototherapy was found to be highly effective in preventing TB from rising to the AAP exchange transfusion threshold, especially in full-term infants who are appropriate size for GA, older than 48 hours at the time TB level reaches the phototherapy threshold, and no DAT positivity. Results from this study also suggested that phototherapy may not be required in post-term infants whose hyperbilirubinemia occurred later (after 72 hours of age) as the authors estimated that 600 to 3000 infants would need phototherapy in order to prevent one infant from reaching the exchange transfusion level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phototherapy exposes the infant's skin to light of a specific wavelength, which reduces TB levels by the following three mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural isomerization to lumirubin &ndash; Phototherapy converts bilirubin into lumirubin via structural isomerization that is not reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lumirubin, a more soluble substance than bilirubin, is excreted without conjugation into bile and urine. This is probably the principal mechanism by which phototherapy reduces the TB concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photoisomerization to a less toxic bilirubin isomer &ndash; Phototherapy converts the stable 4Z,15Z bilirubin isomer to the 4Z,15E isomer, which is more polar and less toxic than the 4Z,15Z form. Like lumirubin, the 4Z,15E isomer is excreted into bile without conjugation. Unlike structural isomerization to lumirubin, photoisomerization is reversible; however, clearance of the 4Z,15E isomer is very slow and the photoisomerization is reversible. Thus, some of the 4Z,15E isomer in bile is converted back to the stable 4Z,15Z isomer. As a result, this pathway may have little effect on TB values. In addition, standard laboratory measurements do not distinguish between the isomers, so these measurements do not reflect these changes. Nevertheless, photoisomerization does reduce the amount of potentially toxic bilirubin by rapidly converting 15 percent to a non-toxic form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photo-oxidation to polar molecules &ndash; Photo-oxidation reactions convert bilirubin to colorless, polar compounds that are excreted primarily in the urine. This is a slow process and accounts for a small proportion of bilirubin elimination.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During phototherapy, the area covered by the diaper should be minimized. The eyes should be shielded with an opaque blindfold and care should be taken to prevent the blindfold from covering the nose. With fluorescent lights, the infant should be placed supine in an open crib or bassinet, or on a warmer, rather than in an incubator (the top of the incubator prevents the light from being brought sufficiently close to the infant) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113863\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113863 \">picture 1</a>). Lining the sides of the bassinet or warmer with aluminum foil or white material increases the exposed surface area of the infant and the efficiency of phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The use of reflective white curtains around the phototherapy light source has also been shown to increase phototherapy efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>For TB levels &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (342 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> phototherapy should be administered continuously, until the TB falls below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (342 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Once this occurs, phototherapy can be interrupted for feeding and parental visits.</p><p>The dose of phototherapy, known as irradiance (measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">microW/cm<sup>2</sup></span> of body surface area exposed per nm of wavelength [425 to 475 nm]), determines its efficacy. Irradiance depends upon the type of the light used, distance between the light and infant, and the exposed surface area of the infant. Irradiance usually is expressed for a certain wavelength band (spectral irradiance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In conventional phototherapy, the typical irradiance is 6 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">microW/cm<sup>2</sup>/nm,</span> and in intensive phototherapy it is &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">microW/cm<sup>2</sup>/nm</span>.</p><p>For effective (intensive) phototherapy, high levels of irradiance (usually &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">microW/cm<sup>2</sup>/nm)</span> are delivered to as much of an infant's surface area as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The necessary irradiance can be achieved using a phototherapy light placed at a distance of 10 to 30 cm from the infant's body depending on the manufacturer's recommendation in combination with a fiberoptic pad, light-emitting diode (LED) mattress, or special blue lights below the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, blankets are small and rarely cover sufficient surface area to be effective when used alone in term infants. They can be used as an adjunct to overhead fluorescent or halogen lights. Fiberoptic blankets also can be used during feedings when overhead fluorescent or halogen lights are discontinued. This is particularly helpful for infants with severe hyperbilirubinemia.

This is important in infants who need phototherapy during their birth hospitalization, but might not be necessary in those who have been readmitted where the risk of rebound is much lower.

Essentially, the rate of bilirubin rise is likely to continue without phototherapy and exceeds the natural elimination process. Most likely, the excessive bilirubin production is due to unabated hemolysis. Rebound hyperbilirubinemia is not likely to require serial TB measurements and reinitiation of phototherapy. Although uncommon, clinically significant rebound hyperbilirubinemia reaching TB levels to phototherapy initiation thresholds within 72 hours of phototherapy termination can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

If phototherapy is a risk factor, the effect is modest at best. Nevertheless, the concern of potential long-term risk of cancer serves as a reminder that phototherapy should be prescribed judiciously such that it becomes routine practice to measure its dose, use appropriate narrow-band light sources, and apply phototherapy for the least duration while minimizing an infant's risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective cohort single network study of infants born &ge;35 weeks GA between 1995 and 2011reported a higher prevalence of childhood cancer in children exposed to phototherapy (using unknown device performances or exposure to unfiltered sunlight) compared with unexposed controls (25 versus 18 per 100,000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].
