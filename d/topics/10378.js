The symptoms result from an imbalance between the supply and demand for blood flow due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with claudication have PAD; however, some patients may have claudication due to other diseases (eg, thrombosed popliteal aneurysm, popliteal entrapment syndrome, adductor bursitis, and spine or hip osteoarthritis), for which management differs from PAD and is discussed in separate reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H497998882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis of PAD'</a>.)</p><p>The management of the patient with claudication due to PAD, including medical therapy and indications for intervention, will be reviewed here. The management of limb-threatening ischemia (rest pain, ulcers, gangrene) and techniques for reconstruction and their outcomes are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H1576665360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Rutherford'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H1576665368\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Fontaine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50931201\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with a diagnosis of claudication due to PAD should be treated initially with a medical therapy regimen because PAD reflects a systemic disease of atherosclerosis and must include risk factor modification and exercise therapy (ideally supervised exercise therapy) and pharmacologic therapy, rather than vascular intervention or surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109428\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109428 \">algorithm 1</a>). Periodic reevaluation of symptoms will determine the effectiveness of these therapies. A selected subset of patients may be appropriate for initial intervention. (See <a href=\"#H50931633\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Exercise therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H50934672\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing evaluation and follow-up'</a> below and <a href=\"#H53753243\" class=\"local\">'Referral for possible intervention'</a> below.)</p><p>Although PAD and its severity is an important marker for cardiovascular risk, symptoms of claudication are associated with a low risk of progression to limb-threatening lower extremity ischemia. Natural history studies show that most patients with claudication remain stable, particularly if they stop smoking. The following limb outcomes at five years demonstrate the low risk of progression for patients with lower extremity claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease#H21057703\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Natural history and progression of PAD'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable claudication: 70 to 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening claudication: 10 to 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression to critical limb ischemia: 1 to 2 percent</p><p/><p>Improvements in walking parameters tend to be fewer with pharmacologic therapies compared with exercise therapy, and it should be realized that walking improvement with exercise therapy is relatively modest. Continued smoking restricts improvements in pain-free walking symptoms that might otherwise be seen with an exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and with continued smoking, patients are also less likely to benefit from the pharmacologic agents discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy to improve walking'</a> below.)</p><p>Whether minimally invasive vascular intervention improves the clinical status of patients with claudication due to PAD is debated. Functional improvements with a medical therapy regimen that includes exercise therapy tend to be more durable than percutaneous intervention as an initial treatment strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The lack of reimbursement for supervised exercise therapy is often cited as a major practical limitation by those who advocate for early intervention in the United States; however, this limitation is now resolved. (See <a href=\"#H86506333\" class=\"local\">'CMS coverage'</a> below.)</p><p>A systematic review identified trials performed between 1996 and 2015 (including the CLEVER trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]) comparing supervised exercise therapy either alone or combined with intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">(angioplasty/stenting)</span> in patients with stable claudication and found that a combination of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and exercise (supervised exercise therapy or exercise advice) may produce the greatest changes in walking distance compared with exercise alone or PTA alone, but this did not uniformly translate to a quality-of-life improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among five trials that compared supervised exercise therapy alone with intervention alone, there were no differences for exercise capacity or risk of future revascularization or amputation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among four trials that compared supervised exercise therapy alone with patients who underwent supervised exercise therapy combined with endovascular therapy, those in the combined therapy group had a higher maximum walking distance (weighted mean difference 98.9 feet, 95% CI 31.4-166.4 feet) and lower risk of revascularization or amputation (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.09-0.40). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the trials that had longer follow-up, PTA, supervised exercise, or combined treatment were compared in 178 patients with claudication related to femoropopliteal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. With long-term follow-up (mean 5.2 years, range 3.8 to 7.4 years), those who had angioplasty (with or without exercise) had a significantly higher ankle-brachial index (ABI), but no significant differences were observed between the groups for treadmill walking distances, restenosis rates, new ipsilateral and contralateral lesions on duplex imaging, or quality-of-life outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A handful of trials have found significant quality-of-life improvements for those undergoing intervention in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

In general, exercise should be performed for a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes at least three times per week for a minimum of 12 weeks. During each session, an exercise level that is of sufficient intensity to elicit claudication should be achieved. </p><p>Supervised exercise programs generally consist of a series of sessions lasting 45 to 60 minutes per session, using a treadmill. Including warm-up and cool-down periods of 5 to 10 minutes each, the initial session usually includes 35 minutes of intermittent walking. Walking is then increased by five minutes each session until 50 minutes of intermittent walking can be accomplished. Ideally, the patient attends at least three sessions per week, with a program length greater than three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each session is supervised on a one-to-one basis by an exercise physiologist, physical therapist, or nurse. The supervisor monitors the patient's claudication threshold and other cardiovascular parameters. During supervised exercise, the development of new arrhythmias, symptoms that might suggest angina, or the continued inability of the patient to progress to an adequate level of exercise may require physician review and examination of the patient. Most patients who eventually respond to a supervised exercise protocol can expect improvement within two months, but the benefits of exercise diminish if exercise training stops. </p><p>Although most trials have used lower extremity exercise (eg, treadmill or walking), one trial found that the improvement in claudication distance with an exercise regimen was similar for lower limb compared with upper limb exercise with similar increases in claudication distance (51 and 57 percent), maximal walking distance (29 and 31 percent), and peak oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

Lower extremity resistance training intervention did not improve six-minute walking distance in PAD participants, but it did improve maximal treadmill walking time and quality-of-life measures, particularly stair climbing ability. This mode of exercise may be useful for those who are unable to participate in a walking program. Suggestions for muscle strengthening in older adults are reviewed separately.

Claudication resulting from disease in this location often tends to be more disabling (buttock or thigh claudication), and the threshold to intervene when treating claudication for inflow disease is generally lower than for more distal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109428\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109428 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Calf claudication is usually due to a lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery and can be treated using balloon <span class=\"nowrap\">angioplasty/stenting</span> of the femoral or superficial femoral artery, or surgical bypass such as femoral to above-knee popliteal bypass or femoral to below-knee bypass. Rarely, a more distal bypass may be needed to treat symptoms of claudication, but more typically, symptoms more severe than claudication (rest pain, ischemic ulcers) result from multiple lesions and disease of the tibial vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95378708\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of initial intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining whether percutaneous or surgical revascularization is the more appropriate initial intervention for patients with claudication depends upon the location and extent of disease, and the patient's risk for the intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109428\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109428 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Given the widespread availability of percutaneous procedures, major cardiovascular society guidelines have recommended initial percutaneous revascularization, reserving surgery for when arterial anatomy is not favorable for a percutaneous approach, provided the patient has an acceptable risk for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/1,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16-18</a>]. Lesions that display unfavorable anatomy for a percutaneous approach have one or more of the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-segment stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal stenoses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eccentric, calcified stenosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long segment occlusions</p><p/><p>These features reflect more extensive disease and are typically associated with severe symptoms. The Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Artery Diseases (TASC II) presented a scheme that classified iliac, femoral, and popliteal lesions as type A, B, C, or D, which was based upon overall success rates for treating a lesion using endovascular or surgical means at the time the classification was created [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There are no classifications referable to the tibial vessels. Short segment disease (type A) was more likely to be successfully treated with an endovascular intervention compared with long segment occlusion (type D). The details of the TASC classification are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H909629056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'TASC classification'</a>.) </p><p>The TASC II general guidelines are given below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The location of the lesion, along with the patient's comorbidities, fully informed patient preference, and the operator's long-term success rates, must be considered when making treatment recommendations. Endovascular intervention for aortoiliac (&quot;inflow&quot;) lesions tends to have better long-term outcomes compared with interventions for infrainguinal (&quot;outflow&quot;) lesions. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovascular therapy is the treatment of choice for TASC type A lesions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovascular treatment is preferred over surgical treatment for TASC type B lesions. Patients with Type B lesions who fail endovascular management may also benefit from surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with type C lesions who are not good-risk candidates for surgery may also benefit from percutaneous intervention, but for good-risk candidates, surgery is preferred. However, the choice depends on lesion location (see above regarding inflow versus outflow lesions). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is the treatment of choice for Type D lesions. However, the choice depends on lesion location (see above regarding inflow versus outflow lesions).</p><p/><p>With advancements in balloons, stents, and delivery systems, percutaneous intervention can be offered to poor surgical candidates with more extensive PAD. Compared with lower extremity bypass, endovascular interventions are associated with fewer periprocedural complications but higher rates of restenosis, which can usually be managed with repeat intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. In one retrospective review, risk factors for restenosis in femoropopliteal lesions included diabetes, no stent use, chronic total occlusion, and poor below-the-knee runoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. For the patient who remains disabled following initial attempts at percutaneous revascularization, surgical bypass may be an option, but, in general, surgery should be reserved for low-risk patients with disabling symptoms who can be expected to tolerate the procedure and live long enough to enjoy the improved quality of life. The same criteria are used in diabetics even though they are at higher risk for a worse outcome. Patients who benefit most from elective surgical revascularization are generally under 70 years of age, are nondiabetic, and have little evidence of disease distal to the primary lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>This general approach may differ in very young patients (&lt;40 years of age) with claudication. Symptoms in this group of patients are typically due to a more aggressive atherosclerotic disease process than that experienced by the majority of older patients with claudication. The aggressive nature of arteriosclerosis obliterans in young individuals was demonstrated in a retrospective series of 29 vascular reconstructions in patients under the age of 40, 76 percent of which were for intermittent claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-claudication/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].

Medical management involves risk factor modification, exercise, and possibly pharmacologic therapy to improve walking distance. Vascular intervention may be indicated for some patients with debilitating claudication. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H50931105\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Claudication is associated with an increased risk of coronary, cerebrovascular, and renovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) is considered to be a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. To reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease progression and complications, we recommend a secondary prevention strategy that includes antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 75 to 162 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> smoking cessation, control of blood sugar and blood pressure, lipid-lowering therapy, and dietary modification (as needed) to achieve the goals set in national guidelines. We do not use dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with claudication in the absence of other indications (eg, drug-eluting stent, prosthetic distal lower extremity bypass). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular risk modification'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with claudication, we recommend an initial medical treatment regimen that includes risk reduction, exercise therapy (for those who can participate), and possibly pharmacologic therapy, rather than initial vascular intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Symptoms of claudication are associated with a low risk of progression to limb-threatening lower extremity ischemia, and a major concern with intervention is that some patients may suffer complications that worsen their symptoms. A subset of patients with severe claudication and inflow disease may benefit from early vascular intervention. (See <a href=\"#H50931105\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H50931201\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H50931546\" class=\"local\">'Interventions for claudication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who can participate in exercise therapy, we suggest supervised rather than unsupervised exercise therapy, where available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The value of an unsupervised exercise program is less well studied but can still generally be recommended for patients who cannot participate in a supervised exercise program. Exercise therapy should be performed for a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes at least three times per week for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to reevaluation. During each session, an exercise level that is of sufficient intensity to elicit claudication should be achieved. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Exercise therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication who do not have an improvement in symptoms with risk modification and exercise therapy, we suggest a therapeutic trial of naftidrofuryl or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cilostazol</a> (100 mg twice daily) depending upon availability (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Naftidrofuryl has fewer side effects, and, where both are available, naftidrofuryl can be tried first. If the effect is not sufficient, then changing to cilostazol is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy to improve walking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest follow-up after three months to assess the effectiveness of the initial medical therapy regimen for reducing symptoms. Patients who show improvement and who are satisfied with their progress can be scheduled for annual vascular examination. For patients who have been compliant with risk reduction strategies, yet six months to one year of exercise therapy and adjunctive pharmacotherapy have failed to provide satisfactory improvement, referral for possible revascularization is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H50934672\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing evaluation and follow-up'</a> above and <a href=\"#H53753243\" class=\"local\">'Referral for possible intervention'</a> above and <a href=\"#H80018061\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for revascularization include percutaneous intervention, surgical bypass, or a combination of these, and the choice depends upon the level of obstruction (aortoiliac, femoropopliteal) and severity of disease, and the patient's risk for the intervention. We agree with major cardiovascular society guidelines that recommend an initial attempt at percutaneous revascularization, reserving surgery for when arterial anatomy is not favorable for a percutaneous approach, provided the patient has an acceptable risk for surgery.
