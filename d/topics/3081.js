Glucocorticoids may induce adrenal insufficiency, even if given in a dose that normally would not suppress the axis, if their metabolism is reduced by a drug interaction. This can occur, for example, when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> are both given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-and-tertiary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

They also block the trophic and corticotropic (ACTH) secretagogue actions of CRH on the anterior pituitary. This results in decreased synthesis of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and decreased secretion of ACTH and other POMC-derived peptides by the pituitary corticotrophs. As a result, pituitary corticotrophs decrease in size, and eventually, the number of identifiable corticotrophs decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-and-tertiary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In the absence of ACTH stimulation, the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis of the adrenal atrophy and can no longer produce cortisol.

Glucocorticoids may be taken via the oral, ocular, inhaled, transdermal, rectal, or parenteral routes, all of which should be considered.

Finally, patients should be asked about any recent therapeutic injections (ie, joint, spine) as many patients are unaware that these contain glucocorticoids. Measurement of exogenous steroids in urine may help to establish the cause and estimate time to recovery if the Cushing's syndrome has occurred as a result of a synthetic glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-and-tertiary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">After the cure of Cushing's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tertiary adrenal insufficiency also occurs in patients who are cured of Cushing's syndrome by removal of a pituitary or nonpituitary ACTH-secreting or a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor.

The ACTH deficiency may be isolated or occur in conjunction with other pituitary hormone deficiencies (panhypopituitarism) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55951 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Secondary adrenal insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated ACTH deficiency is a rare disorder. Some cases are thought to be due to an autoimmune process (see <a href=\"#H346127370\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune'</a> above). Genetic causes include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss-of-function mutations in the proopiomelanocortin (<em>POMC</em>) gene resulting in a syndrome of early-onset obesity and secondary adrenal insufficiency (see <a href=\"#H346127458\" class=\"local\">'Mutations in the POMC gene'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>ACTH deficiency due to a defect in the enzyme that cleaves ACTH from POMC (see <a href=\"#H346127466\" class=\"local\">'Cleavage enzyme defect'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>TPIT</em> gene mutations resulting in neonatal isolated ACTH deficiency (see <a href=\"#H346127473\" class=\"local\">'TPIT gene mutations'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency include familial cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) deficiency, traumatic brain injury, and drugs (chronic use of high-dose progestins and opiates). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Familial cortisol-binding globulin (CBG, transcortin) deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic brain injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H290041754\" class=\"local\">'Drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>Tertiary adrenal insufficiency</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function by chronic administration of high doses of glucocorticoids is the most common cause of tertiary adrenal insufficiency. Clinical features of secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency that help distinguish them from primary adrenal insufficiency include: cortisol production can be restored by prolonged ACTH administration, and mineralocorticoid secretion is nearly normal because this function depends mostly on the renin-angiotensin system rather than on ACTH. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Chronic high-dose glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tertiary adrenal insufficiency also occurs in patients who are cured of Cushing's syndrome by removal of a pituitary or nonpituitary ACTH-secreting or a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor. The chronically high serum cortisol concentrations before treatment suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the same manner as chronic administration of high doses of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'After the cure of Cushing's syndrome'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-secondary-and-tertiary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Modhi G, Bauman W, Nicolis G.
