High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening form of such illness that involves abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs, and in fact is the most common fatal manifestation of severe high altitude illness.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention of HAPE are reviewed here. Other forms of high altitude illness are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is the abnormal accumulation of plasma and some red cells in the lung due to a breakdown in the pulmonary blood-gas barrier, triggered by hypobaric hypoxia. This breakdown develops from a number of maladaptive responses to the hypoxia encountered at higher altitudes, including poor ventilatory response, increased sympathetic tone, exaggerated and uneven pulmonary vasoconstriction (pulmonary hypertension), inadequate production of endothelial nitric oxide, and overproduction of endothelin, many of which are genetically determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The end result is a patchy accumulation of extravascular fluid in the alveolar spaces that impairs respiration and can, in severe cases, prove fatal.</p><p>Genetics clearly play an important role in the risk of HAPE, as suggested by the marked variability in individual susceptibility, the higher rates of recurrence among some individuals, and the pathophysiological factors mentioned above. However, HAPE genetic studies are conflicting and clear conclusions are elusive. Genes associated with HAPE have included those in the pathways for nitric oxide, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), heat shock protein (HSP 70), pulmonary surfactant proteins A1 and A2, and aquaporin-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. &#160;</p><p>High mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, in excess of 35 to 40 mmHg, appears to be the initiating event. Specific segmental and subsegmental capillary beds with relatively less vasoconstriction are disproportionately exposed to elevated microvascular pressures (&gt;20 mmHg) that arise from the elevated mean PA pressure. This uneven vasoconstriction and regional overperfusion result in failure of the alveolar-capillary barrier and patchy pulmonary edema.</p><p>As disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier progresses, high molecular weight proteins, cells, and fluid leak into the alveolar space. Eventually, basement endothelial and epithelial cell membranes are disrupted, leading to alveolar hemorrhage.</p><p>A striking feature of HAPE is the rapid reversibility of this process with descent or sometimes simply the administration of oxygen. Pulmonary vascular resistance returns to normal within days after descent to low altitude.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAPE generally occurs above 2500 m (8000 feet) and is uncommon below 3000 m (10,000 feet) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199 \">table 2</a>). The risk depends upon individual susceptibility, altitude attained, rate of ascent, and time spent at altitude. At approximately 4500 m (14,800 feet) the incidence of HAPE ranges from 0.2 to 6 percent, depending upon the rate of ascent. At 5500 m (18,000 feet) the incidence ranges between 2 and 15 percent, again depending upon rate of ascent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) develop in a high percentage of those with HAPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. HAPE and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) may also occur concomitantly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Factors associated with an increased incidence of HAPE include male gender, cold ambient temperatures, preexisting respiratory infection, and vigorous exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Preexisting conditions or anatomic abnormalities that lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, or increased pulmonary vascular reactivity may predispose to HAPE, even at altitudes below 2500 m. These include primary pulmonary hypertension, congenital absence of one pulmonary artery, and left-to-right intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects.</p><p>A patent foramen ovale (PFO), in the setting of rising pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), may reverse the direction of blood flow, shunting blood from right to left and further exacerbating hypoxemia. PFO is four times more common among HAPE-susceptible individuals. Larger PFOs correlate directly with increased arterial hypoxemia, and a trend toward an increased risk of developing HAPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whether PFO contributes to HAPE or is merely a marker of increased vascular reactivity and susceptibility remains unknown. There is currently no indication for closing PFO in HAPE-susceptible persons in hopes of preventing HAPE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163127937\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation in adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAPE generally begins with a subtle, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath with exertion, and difficulty walking uphill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Such nonspecific symptoms are easily mistaken for a benign upper respiratory tract infection or attributed to normal breathlessness at altitude or exhaustion. Initial symptoms typically appear two to four days after arrival at a new altitude. Occasionally, HAPE develops precipitously. This occurs more often at night or after severe exertion. HAPE almost never develops after a week at the same altitude.</p><p>As HAPE progresses, dyspnea becomes noticeable at rest and severe with any attempt at exertion. Even walking on a level surface becomes an effort. A cardinal clinical feature of HAPE is the early progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest. In about 50 percent of cases, HAPE is accompanied by acute mountain sickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As symptoms progress, the cough can become productive of pink, frothy sputum and may produce frank blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Severely restricted exercise tolerance becomes debilitating and severe hypoxemia may become life-threatening without prompt descent or supplemental oxygen. Severe hypoxemia may cause drowsiness or concomitant high altitude cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>On physical examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade fever (up to 38&ordm;C) are common. Inspiratory crackles may be more prominent in the right middle lobe initially, but become bilateral and diffuse as HAPE progresses. Auscultation of the right middle lobe is best performed at the mid-lateral chest wall. Persons with blunted carotid body function, genetic or acquired (eg, carotid endarterectomy, neck radiation), may present without respiratory symptoms and instead with drowsiness, confusion and other CNS symptoms and findings.</p><p>Pulse oximetry reveals saturation values (SpO2) at least 10 points lower than expected for the altitude, and absolute values may be as low as 40 to 50 percent. Typically, the patient appears better than expected given the severity of hypoxemia, and the oxygen saturation improves promptly (usually within 10 to 15 minutes) in response to supplemental oxygen. This rapid correction of the SpO2 and clinical status with supplemental oxygen in the setting of a severe infiltrative lung process seen on radiograph are virtually pathognomonic for HAPE, as this does not occur with other pulmonary processes (eg, pneumonia, ADHF) capable of causing such severe hypoxemia and associated with diffuse crackles or rhonchi. </p><p>Thus, pulse oximetry is often a useful tool for distinguishing HAPE from other conditions. However, expected SpO2 values vary with a number of factors, including the altitude, degree and rate of acclimatization, patient&rsquo;s hypoxic ventilatory drive, and method of measurement (eg, variation among pulse oximeters), and therefore should be interpreted carefully. SpO2 is lowest the first day at high altitude and rises over four days to a near-maximum value, usually 3 to 5 points higher than day one. Although expected values can vary widely in normal individuals at any given altitude, comparing SpO2 measurements with others in the same travel group who arrived at altitude together can help to establish relative &ldquo;normal&rdquo; values. The following figures provide approximate average values for SpO2 and other parameters at a range of altitudes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56808\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56808 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98575 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, HAPE presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days, but may develop more precipitously. Young children may manifest only pallor and depressed consciousness or other nonspecific symptoms such as increased fussiness, crying, decreased appetite, decreased playfulness, disrupted sleep, and possibly vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In infants, increased pulmonary artery pressure and fetal shunting, without HAPE, can cause severe hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of note, HAPE alone does not cause an elevation in body temperature over 38.3&ordm;C (101&#730;F), and young children with a higher fever should be assessed for other causes of fever. Respiratory infection and HAPE can coexist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-without-a-source-in-children-3-to-36-months-of-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis in children includes pneumonia, undetected intracardiac shunts, and in infants opening of fetal shunts in response to high altitude pulmonary hypertension.

However, chest radiography is useful and reveals characteristic patchy alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right central hemithorax, which become more confluent and bilateral as the illness progresses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80267\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80267 \">image 1</a>). However, in some cases the infiltrates may start in the left lung. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although the radiographic appearance of HAPE may mimic that of infectious infiltrates, we often find a significant discrepancy between the extensive infiltrates on radiograph and the patient&rsquo;s clinical status. The patient with HAPE often does not appear as severely ill as one would expect based on the x-ray findings, and steadily improves with oxygen therapy. In contrast, a patient with a comparable chest radiograph due to pneumonia typically appears critically ill and often requires tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest reveals findings similar to those of plain radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67452\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67452 \">image 2</a>). Echocardiography reveals increased pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and sometimes right heart dysfunction and paradoxical septal motion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101254987\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies suggest that&nbsp;ultrasonography&nbsp;is a highly-sensitive and semi-quantitative means of detecting increased extravascular lung water (EVLW)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. If traditional chest radiography is unavailable (eg, at a remote clinic or in the field) or undesirable (eg, due to radiation or cold exposure risks), chest sonography is a practical and useful&nbsp;tool for identifying&nbsp;HAPE.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In the appropriate clinical setting, namely ascent to high altitude by an unacclimatized person who develops typical signs and symptoms and an abnormally low SpO2,&nbsp;HAPE can be confirmed by&nbsp;the presence of<em>&nbsp;</em>ultrasound lung comets (ULCs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71143\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71143 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64485\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64485 \">movie 1</a>). ULCs are&nbsp;sonographic artifacts originating from water-thickened interlobular septa fanning out from the lung surface. They are&nbsp;caused by the air-fluid interface in the presence of increased&nbsp;EVLW.&nbsp;ULCs may be referred to as&nbsp;B-lines or &ldquo;comet tails,&rdquo;&nbsp;and&nbsp;are the&nbsp;sonographic equivalent of radiographic Kerley B-lines, which are described separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-diffuse-lung-disease-by-conventional-chest-radiography#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of diffuse lung disease by conventional chest radiography&quot;, section on 'Linear'</a>.)</p><p>Drawbacks to using ultrasound to diagnose HAPE include a lack of specificity and questions about its utility. Ultrasound cannot&nbsp;differentiate HAPE from cardiogenic pulmonary edema and other causes of increased EVLW. In addition, ultrasound findings may not be clinically&nbsp;relevant at altitude,&nbsp;as clinically insignificant ULCs are commonly seen&nbsp;in&nbsp;recreational climbers who are asymptomatic and do not develop HAPE<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and ultrasound findings may not contribute anything to diagnosing HAPE beyond what is already known from examination findings and oximetry.&nbsp;While the quantity of ULCs corresponds closely to clinical and oximetry findings, it is not known what number of ULCs is an appropriate diagnostic threshold for&nbsp;HAPE,&nbsp;as opposed to subclinical pulmonary edema. Nevertheless, the technique for identifying ULCs is easily performed and may be useful in the proper clinical setting, such as when the cause of dyspnea is unclear&nbsp;despite a&nbsp;careful history and&nbsp;physical examination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101254908\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No laboratory test demonstrates adequate specificity to aid in the diagnosis of HAPE. In patients with HAPE, the white blood cell count is typically elevated. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and related tests (eg, pro-BNP) may be slightly elevated at high altitudes, and troponin may be elevated in the setting of HAPE associated with right heart strain. However, such results do not distinguish among potential diagnoses (eg, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure), and may not be elevated in the patient with HAPE. The results of other readily available tests are also nonspecific and unhelpful in diagnosing HAPE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'BNP and NT-proBNP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163127988\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAPE is typically diagnosed clinically on the basis of the history and examination findings. The initial symptoms typically begin two to four days after arrival at high altitude and include a subtle nonproductive cough, shortness of breath on exertion, and difficulty walking uphill. Symptoms can develop more precipitously in children. Over one to two days the cough often becomes productive. Early progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest is a cardinal feature. Prominent examination findings include tachycardia, tachypnea, low-grade fever (up to 38&ordm;C), and pulmonary crackles. Oxygen saturation is lower than expected for a given altitude. Treatment with supplemental oxygen and rest can lead to rapid improvement. Characteristic findings on imaging studies, when available and indicated, help to confirm the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2481879695\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnoses confused with HAPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonia heads the list of differential diagnoses that can be confused with HAPE, but others to consider include pulmonary embolism, acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), acute coronary syndrome, bronchitis, and reactive airway disease. Of note, HAPE and infection can coexist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Differentiating HAPE from such ailments as pneumonia or ADHF can be difficult, particularly in older patients with comorbid conditions. In such patients, HAPE is a diagnosis of exclusion and alternative diagnoses should be worked up in standard fashion. HAPE is associated with marked weakness and often severe hypoxemia (SpO2 of 50 to 75 percent; PaO2 of 25 to 40 mmHg). While ill-appearing, such patients with HAPE generally look better than would be expected given their extreme hypoxemia and can improve relatively rapidly with supplemental oxygen therapy.</p><p>More commonly, the diagnosis of HAPE is entertained in otherwise healthy patients with a characteristic history and examination findings. Rapid response over hours to oxygen therapy strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE in this setting. Rapid improvement with descent is another important diagnostic clue to the diagnosis of HAPE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H851845802\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing HAPE and pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The non-specific symptoms and signs associated with pneumonia,&nbsp;including cough, dyspnea, low-grade fever, pulmonary infiltrates,&nbsp;and hypoxemia, and laboratory abnormalities such as a modestly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count,&nbsp;are also common features of HAPE. </p><p>HAPE may be precipitated by or co-exist with pneumonia, and distinguishing between these diagnoses can be challenging. The presence of marked hypoxemia (common with HAPE), extensive infiltrates on chest radiograph, and modest elevations of the WBC count (10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">15,000/microL)</span> frequently&nbsp;influence clinicians treating HAPE to administer empiric antibiotics for the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia.&nbsp;While the decision to treat HAPE with empiric antibiotics based on such concerns remains clinical and subjective, many cases of pneumonia (when in fact present) in this setting are&nbsp;of viral etiology and do&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;warrant antibiotic administration.</p><p>There is little published, high quality evidence that can help us to&nbsp;distinguish reliably between isolated HAPE and HAPE with concomitant pneumonia, but a number of clinical findings can provide some insight. Purulent sputum (particularly if a properly performed gram stain is positive for bacteria),&nbsp;temperature &gt;38&deg;C (100.5&deg;F), elevated WBC <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;15,000/microL</span> with a left shift, ie, predominately bands), elevated procalcitonin (&gt;0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> and a history of respiratory tract infection in the two to three days preceding the development of HAPE,&nbsp;are consistent with an infectious process and the authors believe that treatment with empiric antibiotics is appropriate in this setting.</p><p>Conversely, in otherwise healthy patients with a characteristic history of HAPE and examination findings consistent with the diagnosis, antibiotics are typically not necessary. In such cases, a rapid response over several hours to oxygen therapy strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE. In contrast, symptoms and signs of pneumonia require several days before clinical improvement. Rapid improvement with descent to lower altitude is another important diagnostic clue suggesting the diagnosis of HAPE without pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early recognition of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and prompt intervention are critical to assuring a favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1,9,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,22,23</a>]. Unlike high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), immediate descent is not mandatory in all treatment settings. Instead, treatment of HAPE varies depending upon a number of factors, including severity of illness, available treatments, setting, clinician experience, and patient preference. As examples, management of a resort skier at 2500 m may consist solely of supplemental oxygen and rest, while management of a mountaineer camping in a remote location at 5500 m and without access to supplemental oxygen requires immediate descent.</p><p>The key principle in successful treatment of HAPE, regardless of the setting or patient age, is prompt reduction of pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. Means to achieve this end include limiting physical exertion and cold exposure, providing supplemental oxygen via tank or concentrator, evacuation to a lower altitude, simulating descent using hyperbaric therapy, and giving appropriate medications. Descent (simulated or actual) and supplemental oxygen are often effective alone and appear to be superior to any pharmacologic therapy.</p><p>No trials have been performed in patients with HAPE that directly compare treatment using oxygen and descent with pharmacologic therapy. Nevertheless, the clinical outcomes reported in studies in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> alone was used for treatment were poor compared with those involving oxygen and descent without medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Pharmacotherapy (nifedipine) was of no added clinical benefit in patients who received oxygen and descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen is first-line therapy for HAPE and should be provided in all treatment settings when available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1,14,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,26,27</a>]. It can be life-saving. Relieving hypoxemia is the most effective method of reducing pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, reversing capillary leak, and protecting the brain and other organs. Supplemental oxygen immediately increases PaO2 and reduces both the heart and respiratory rates.</p><p>In the field, oxygen may be limited, precluding its use as the sole treatment. Supplemental oxygen can be combined with descent (or hyperbaric therapy) and medication in such cases. However, while some studies have shown that oxygen combined with medication is more effective than oxygen alone in lowering PA pressure, clinical outcomes were not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>In the hospital setting, supplemental oxygen and rest are generally sufficient therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/14,22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22,30</a>]. A common regimen in North American hospitals near ski resorts (elevation approximately 2500 to 3000 m) is to treat with high flow supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask for several hours until the patient's oxygen requirement is &le;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> with the SpO2 maintained at 90 percent or higher. If the patient is clinically improved and appropriate for outpatient therapy, he or she may be sent home with an oxygen concentrator to be used continuously and strict instructions to rest. The patient's condition and SpO2 are rechecked daily until an ambulatory SpO2, measured while the patient breathes room air, is &ge;90 percent. At this point, supplemental oxygen is discontinued and the patient is advised to slowly return to activity over the following one to three days.

HAPE can progress rapidly and the opportunity for evacuation may be lost if there is any delay. At higher elevations (&gt;4000 m), descent is mandatory, in part because of the risk of developing HACE. Ideally, immediate evacuation is undertaken to a hospital below 3000 m that is capable of providing high-flow oxygen.</p><p>Nevertheless, in practice, scores of HAPE patients are treated successfully in remote clinics or base camps with modest descent and rest, sometimes in combination with hyperbaric therapy, low-flow supplemental oxygen, and medication. Many remote clinics are located only 500 to 1000 m below the elevation of HAPE onset. When HAPE is diagnosed early and treated in the manner described, many climbers go on to reascend slowly after two to three days of recovery. Recurrence of HAPE in such circumstances has not been reported. Severe cases require evacuation to a medical facility at lower elevation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperbaric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In remote settings, lightweight portable hyperbaric chambers may be life-saving, particularly when supplemental oxygen is unavailable or in short supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-pulmonary-edema/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These devices, although costly, are well-suited to mountaineering and trekking expeditions at high altitude, where compressed oxygen cylinders are too heavy and bulky to transport and are difficult to maintain.</p><p>In isolated mountain settings, hyperbaric therapy is commonly combined with pharmacotherapy and supplemental oxygen, if available. In the hospital setting, elevation is generally lower and high-flow oxygen is readily available. Hyperbaric therapy is not practical or necessary in such hospitals or clinics.

The incidence depends upon individual susceptibility, altitude attained, rate of ascent, and time spent at altitude. Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) develop in approximately 50 percent of those with HAPE. High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) may also occur concomitantly. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexisting conditions or anatomic abnormalities that lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, or increased pulmonary vascular reactivity may predispose to HAPE, even at altitudes below 2500 m. Such conditions include primary pulmonary hypertension and left-to-right intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects. Additional risk factors are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAPE generally begins with a subtle, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath with exercise, and difficulty walking uphill. Symptoms typically appear two to four days after arrival at higher altitude. As HAPE progresses, dyspnea becomes noticeable at rest and severe with any attempt at exertion. On physical examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade fever are common. A cardinal clinical feature of HAPE is the progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest over a relatively brief period. Oxygen saturation values are at least 10 points below normal for altitude, and usually range from 50 to 75 percent. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, HAPE presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days, but may develop more precipitously. Young children may manifest only pallor and depressed consciousness or other nonspecific symptoms. It can be difficult to differentiate between HAPE and viral respiratory infection, and the two may coexist. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Presentation in children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography usually reveals characteristic patchy alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right central hemithorax, which become more confluent and bilateral as the illness progresses. A significant discrepancy often exists between the extensive infiltrates on radiograph and the clinical status of the patient, who often does not appear severely ill and steadily improves with oxygen therapy. Ultrasound can detect increased extravascular lung water, which in the appropriate clinical setting can help to confirm the diagnosis of HAPE. Other commonly available tests are nonspecific. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiating HAPE from such ailments as acute decompensated heart failure or pneumonia can be difficult, particularly in older patients with comorbid conditions. In such patients, HAPE is a diagnosis of exclusion. In general, HAPE is associated with marked weakness and hypoxemia that is more severe than that associated with most cases of pneumonia. Rapid improvement over hours in response to oxygen therapy or descent strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE. In otherwise healthy patients with a characteristic history of HAPE and examination findings consistent with the diagnosis, antibiotics are typically not necessary. (See <a href=\"#H2481879695\" class=\"local\">'Diagnoses confused with HAPE'</a> above and <a href=\"#H851845802\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing HAPE and pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early recognition of HAPE and prompt intervention are critical to assuring a favorable outcome. Immediate descent is not mandatory in all cases, if oxygen is available; treatment varies depending upon the severity of illness, available treatments, setting, and clinician experience. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental oxygen is first-line therapy for HAPE and should be provided in ALL treatment settings when available. Oxygen and descent (simulated or actual) are often effective alone and appear to be superior to any pharmacologic therapy. In the hospital setting, supplemental oxygen and rest are generally sufficient treatment. In remote high-altitude settings, descent should begin as soon as HAPE is suspected. Adjunctive medical therapies may be helpful and are discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with no history of medical problems at high altitude, the risk of HAPE is low and routine prophylaxis is not warranted. We suggest prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> for individuals with a history of HAPE or with known predisposing factors who must ascend to altitudes above 2500 m without adequate time for acclimatization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In such circumstances, we give nifedipine 30 mg of a slow release formulation every 12 hours. Additional adjunct medications for prophylaxis are discussed in the text.
