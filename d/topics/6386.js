It remains a less common procedure in children despite accumulating experience since the mid-1980s in the use of ERCP for a variety of indications. In the last two decades, an increased incidence of acute and chronic pancreatitis has been observed in the pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pancreatic disorders that can be evaluated by ERCP are described here. The use of ERCP for biliary disorders in children and the technique, success, and complications of ERCP in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP for biliary disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-in-children-technique-success-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP in children: Technique, success and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5495726\"><span class=\"h1\">UNEXPLAINED ACUTE AND RECURRENT PANCREATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be considered for all patients with pancreatitis for which an anatomical obstructive etiology is suspected. Potential indications for ERCP in children with pancreatitis are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72692 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565560368\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to considering ERCP, specific nonanatomical causes of pancreatitis should be explored. These include infections, systemic diseases (including systemic inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, inflammatory bowel disease affecting the area of the major papilla, occasionally celiac disease, and auto immune pancreatitis), drug-induced pancreatitis, and blunt trauma to the pancreas. In recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis, hereditary causes should be explored through genetic testing for cationic trypsinogen (<em>PRSS1</em>), serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 gene (<em>SPINK 1</em>), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR</em>) and chymotrypsinogen C (<em>CTRC</em>) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-pancreatitis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Genetic testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents#H779227259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Genetic'</a>.) </p><p>Imaging with abdominal computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is important to establish the extent of the pancreatitis. We recommend MRCP prior to consideration of ERCP for most patients with chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis. ERCP is more invasive and the procedure may trigger or exacerbate pancreatitis. Others have suggested endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) which is particularly useful for diagnosing gallbladder sludge, pancreas divisum, congenital biliary anomalies, duodenal duplication cyst, small biliary or pancreatic stones that may have been missed with other imaging modalities, and chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. On the other hand, ERCP has the advantage of offering therapeutic interventions, such as sphincterotomy, stone removal and stent placement, so it is a valuable therapeutic procedure once a treatable condition has been diagnosed by CT, MRCP, or EUS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children#H1636363986\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;, section on 'Initial imaging'</a>.) </p><p>Special expertise in performing ERCP in infants and children is not widely available. In centers in which this expertise is available, ERCP is often appropriate for treating patients with anatomic pancreatic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66925\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66925 \">table 2</a>), eg, for removing stones, and for placement of stents for the treatment of leaks or strictures. However, the risks and benefits of ERCP depend on individual patient characteristics including age, associated medical comorbidities, and whether an anatomic abnormality identified on noninvasive testing is likely to be treatable with therapeutic ERCP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565565439\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric guidelines are lacking and most of the current indications are extrapolated from the adult literature. ERCP is now considered to be mainly a therapeutic procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565561223\"><span class=\"h3\">First attack of pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a first attack of pancreatitis, the first step is noninvasive testing, typically starting with abdominal ultrasound, followed by pancreatic protocol CT scan or MRCP, using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulation if possible. On occasion, endoscopic ultrasound may also be indicated. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children in whom noninvasive testing reveals a cause that is potentially treatable via ERCP, it is appropriate to proceed to therapeutic ERCP. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children in whom the noninvasive test is unrevealing, expert opinion varies about whether to perform an ERCP after an initial attack of pancreatitis. In our practice, we generally perform an ERCP in such patients, because ERCP may reveal an anatomic cause that can be treated, and we believe that the risk of morbidity associated with recurrence probably outweighs the risk of ERCP. Other experts do not generally perform an ERCP in such patients, reasoning that the likelihood of finding an endoscopically treatable abnormality is low when noninvasive imaging is normal. Reliable data for estimating the risks and benefits of each of these approaches is not available. The relative merits of ERCP versus MRCP for evaluating common bile duct stones in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;, section on 'Common bile duct stones'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565561312\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of children with acute pancreatitis will have recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If noninvasive testing (computerized tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) and genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis is unrevealing, we suggest proceeding to ERCP. ERCP can identify an underlying anatomic abnormality in up to 75 percent of children with recurrent pancreatitis in whom nonanatomical causes have been excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/6-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-16</a>], and in up to 25 percent of those with normal MRCP findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Various anatomic conditions have been associated with recurrent pancreatitis, which can be categorized as congenital or acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66925\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66925 \">table 2</a>). The major diagnoses within these categories will be reviewed below. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12294874\"><span class=\"h2\">ERCP findings and interventions by cause</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several congenital biliary and pancreatic anomalies have been associated with pancreatitis in children, some of which are potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention during ERCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Biliary cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary cysts are cystic dilatations that may occur singly or in multiples throughout the bile ducts. They originally were termed choledochal cysts (involving the extrahepatic bile duct), but the clinical classification was revised in 1977 to include intrahepatic cysts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary cysts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP for biliary disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A biliary cyst is identified in 6 to 18 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/6-9,11,12,15,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,11,12,15,16,18</a>]. Most children with biliary cysts and pancreatitis have an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ, also known as an anomalous pancreaticobiliary union, ABPU) in which the pancreaticobiliary union is located outside the duodenal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51092%7EPEDS%2F62147\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51092 graphicRef62147 \">figure 1A-B</a>). This anomaly has been associated with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. The predisposition of patients with APBJ to pancreatitis might be explained by the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, or might be caused by retrograde flow of bile into the pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;</a>). &#160;</p><p>Therapeutic ERCP is helpful for most patients with biliary cysts and pancreatitis. As an example, in a study of nine children with recurrent pancreatitis and APBJ with a long common channel, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction was suggested by the observation of high basal sphincter pressures. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was successful in preventing further recurrences in 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Children with a choledochocele (in which the cyst is located within the duodenal wall) may also benefit from sphincterotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77426\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77426 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/16,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24-27</a>]. In other patients with biliary cysts, pancreatitis may be due to pancreatic stones or plugs, which can be removed endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63089\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63089 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Pancreas divisum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas and is caused by failure of fusion of the dorsal and ventral endodermal buds. As a result, each duct drains via its own orifice. The major papilla of Vater drains the ventral duct of Wirsung, while the minor accessory papilla drains the dorsal duct of Santorini (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78995 \">figure 2</a>). Pancreas divisum occurs in approximately 7 percent of individuals in autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas divisum: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The association between pancreas divisum and pancreatitis is controversial, since many patients with pancreas divisum (identified during ERCP for indications other than pancreatitis or in autopsy studies) do not have a history of pancreatitis. Indeed, only about 5 percent of individuals with pancreas divisum develop pancreatic symptoms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-divisum-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas divisum: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). However, the rate of pancreas divisum is somewhat higher among patients with recurrent pancreatitis than in the general population. As an example, pancreas divisum has been found in approximately 11 percent of 296 children with recurrent pancreatitis reported in the published literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/6,7,9-12,15,16,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9-12,15,16,29,30</a>]. In our own experience with 272 consecutive successful ERCPs performed for a variety of indications, pancreas divisum was found in nine (3.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The prevalence was considerably higher (12 percent) among the 50 children older than one year who had recurrent pancreatitis. These observations suggest but do not prove that pancreas divisum is associated with recurrent pancreatitis in children, but also confirm that most patients with pancreas divisum do not develop pancreatic disease. </p><p>Endoscopic treatment of pancreas divisum is generally reserved for patients whose symptoms are recurrent and disabling. The treatment typically consists of sphincterotomy of the minor papilla, with or without placement of a stent. Clinical improvement with such treatment has been observed in up to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/11,16,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,32</a>]. The results are less favorable in children with evidence of chronic pancreatitis in the dorsal pancreas. Individuals with pancreas divisum but no dilation of the dorsal duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51844\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51844 \">image 3</a>) are more likely to respond to endoscopic therapy than those with pancreas divisum and a dilated dorsal duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72695\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72695 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113744 \">picture 1</a>).

However, whether there is a causal relationship remains uncertain, since many of the reported cases of annular pancreas (in adults and children) had coexistent pancreas divisum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Several other anomalies have been described in association with pancreatitis including &quot;short pancreas&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82484\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82484 \">image 6</a>), cystic dilation of the pancreatic duct, and pancreatocele (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60893\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60893 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/16,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Duodenal duplication cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports have described pancreatitis in association with a duodenal duplication cyst, presumably due to intermittent obstruction of the pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. ERCP can be helpful for establishing the diagnosis and for definitive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. If the cyst is bulging into the intestinal lumen, a wide cystoduodenostomy can be endoscopically performed with excellent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Cryptosporidiosis can invade the biliary and pancreatic ducts from the intestine in immunodeficient patients, leading to pancreatitis (and biliary duct disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In most cases, the pancreatitis is caused by migration of the worm into the bile duct, causing transient obstruction of the papilla of Vater. Less commonly, the worm migrates into the main pancreatic duct, causing recurrent pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], or rarely causing necrotizing pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Worms can sometimes be removed endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-diagnosis-and-management-of-biliary-parasitosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic diagnosis and management of biliary parasitosis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the cause of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is not known precisely, it is generally considered to be an acquired disorder. It was found in 12 percent of children (17 of 139) with recurrent pancreatitis described in a series of published reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/11,16,18,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,18,32</a>]. In children with recurrent pancreatitis and no other identifiable cause, we explore the possibility of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction during ERCP by performing sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM). No pediatric-specific standards have been developed for SOM, so results are evaluated using adult standards, in which basal pressures &gt;40 mmHg are considered abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Because of the lack of pediatric-specific standards for SOM and the risk of triggering acute pancreatitis, some experts do not perform this test in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Sphincter of Oddi manometry'</a>.) </p><p>An association between SOD and recurrent pancreatitis in children has not been fully established, and limited information is available about outcomes of sphincterotomy in these patients. If SOM reveals an elevated sphincter pressure in a child with recurrent pancreatitis, sphincterotomy leads to clinical improvement in a majority of patients. Biliary sphincterotomy alone may not be sufficient to treat such patients, presumably because the pancreatic sphincter is not transected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/32,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,45</a>]. Thus, dual sphincterotomy may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/16,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,46</a>]. However, the safety and efficacy of this approach has not been well studied. Either manometry or sphincterotomy can trigger an episode of acute pancreatitis; the risk is probably higher after pancreatic than biliary sphincterotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/32,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,47</a>]. In one series, 20 to 30 percent of children developed pancreatitis after endoscopic sphincterotomy for suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In adults, chronic pancreatitis can be categorized by morphology, into calcific or noncalcific phenotypes; in children, pancreatic calcifications are uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Categorization'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Chronic calcific pancreatitis is identified by an imaging study such as a CT scan. Stones can be localized in the pancreatic parenchyma with normal duct anatomy, can be intra ductal (which frequently leads to proximal ductal dilation), or be present in both locations. Parenchymal stones are difficult to treat, and extra corporeal shock wave lithotripsy or surgery may be needed if the patient is symptomatic. Ductal stones can be treated with ERCP and retrieval devices like baskets or balloons.</p><p>Genetic etiologies of chronic pancreatitis (<em>PRSS1, SPINK, CTRC</em>) affect the acinar cell, leading to premature activation of trypsinogen, which can't be inactivated either due to changes in the trypsinogen configuration or a malfunctioning of the inhibitory mechanism. Early in the clinical presentation, genetic etiologies do not appear to cause a calcific phenotype. As the disease progresses, calcifications can develop and are most frequently seen in patients with <em>PRSS1</em> mutations.</p><p>Some of the specific causes of chronic pancreatitis can be identified with laboratory evaluation, genetic tests, and noninvasive imaging including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). An approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of chronic pancreatis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565564516\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the advent of MRCP and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), ERCP is rarely performed for diagnostic purposes. ERCP is an alternative to MRCP for patients in whom a treatable anatomic anomaly is known or strongly suspected because therapeutic ERCP can be performed in the same session. &#160;</p><p>When ERCP is performed for chronic pancreatitis, the earliest changes involve the side branches of the main pancreatic duct and include dilatation, contour irregularity, clubbing, and stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/6,10,16,32,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,16,32,56</a>]. These changes may be accompanied by mild dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. As the disease progresses, the involvement of the main pancreatic duct increases, producing more marked dilatation, irregularity of the walls, and areas of stenosis or occlusion with intraluminal calcifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64898\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64898 \">image 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61617\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61617 \">image 10</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H565564529\"><span class=\"h3\">Therapeutic ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and a dilated main pancreatic duct are candidates for a decompression procedure. Decompression can be accomplished by therapeutic ERCP or by a variety of surgical procedures. The role of endoscopic versus surgical intervention has not been well established in either adults or children. Management in children is based on expert opinion, guided by indirect evidence from adults with chronic pancreatitis and a few small case series in children. </p><p>A role of endoscopic therapy in treatment of chronic pancreatitis is evolving. The only established indication for therapeutic ERCP in children with chronic pancreatitis is for treating abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. ERCP may be used to remove intraductal stones, dilate strictures, and to perform pancreatic sphincterotomy, maneuvers that can improve drainage of the pancreatic duct and improve the pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61617\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61617 \">image 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113745\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113745 \">image 11</a>). A few reports in children have suggested that these approaches can be performed safely in expert hands and may relieve symptoms, at least in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/2,13,16,24,32,48,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,16,24,32,48,57</a>]. For example, 301 children with acute recurrent pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis were enrolled in the INSPPIRE study (INternational Study group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. One hundred seventeen children (38.9 percent) underwent at least one therapeutic ERCP. The procedure was more commonly performed in children with chronic pancreatitis compared with those with acute recurrent pancreatitis (65.8 versus 13.5 percent, p&lt; 0.0001). Utility of therapeutic ERCP was reported to be similar in both groups (53 versus 56 percent, p = 0.81). At present, endoscopic therapy should only be performed in specialized centers, preferably in the context of a clinical study. &#160;</p><p>A small case series suggests a role for surgical intervention in selected children. In a series of 37 children with chronic pancreatitis, those managed by surgical therapy had a lower rate of recurrent pancreatitis and hospitalization as compared with those managed by endoscopic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Some of the patients in this series responded to surgical therapy after failing therapeutic ERCP. </p><p>Some experts have proposed that ERCP and stenting can be used as a therapeutic trial to assess possible benefit of a surgical duct-drainage procedure. As an example, a two-stage management protocol was used in a small series of six children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The patients were first treated with ERCP with pancreatic stenting, and all had relief of pain. Therefore, all of the subjects proceeded to surgical decompression, using longitudinal pancreatojejunostomy (Puestow procedure). All six subjects reported markedly reduced episodes of pain after surgery. &#160;</p><p>Thus, the very limited evidence available suggests that both endoscopic and surgical therapy have a role in the management of children with chronic pancreatitis and abdominal pain. Larger and randomized studies are needed to determine optimal selection of patients for either of these interventions. Most experience in surgical procedures for chronic pancreatitis is in adult patients, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic pseudocysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic pseudocysts are common consequences of acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic trauma. Associated symptoms include abdominal pain and persistent postprandial vomiting. While most small cysts resolve spontaneously, symptomatic, large (&gt;4 cm) pseudocysts are unlikely to resolve and may be associated with complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Such cysts require definitive intervention with a drainage procedure.</p><p>Pseudocysts have traditionally been drained surgically or percutaneously. Endoscopic methods have developed as an alternative to surgical and percutaneous drainage. These methods include cystgastrostomy, cystoduodenostomy, and transpapillary drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53245\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53245 \">image 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>]. In adults, successful pseudocyst resolution has been reported in approximately 80 percent of cases.

Some experts perform ERCP as early as the first day after the injury, while others reserve it for traumatic pancreatitis that does not show signs of resolving within one week of the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Patients with normal ductograms can be treated conservatively while those with duct disruption can be treated with an intrapancreatic stent, thereby reserving surgery for those in whom stenting is unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ercp-for-pancreatic-disease-in-children/abstract/68,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,71</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5493583\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be considered for all patients with pancreatitis for which an anatomical cause is suspected that might be treated endoscopically; potential indications for ERCP in children with suspected pancreatic disease are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72692 \">table 1</a>).

These include systemic diseases (including inflammatory conditions and cystic fibrosis), drug-induced pancreatitis, and blunt trauma. In recurrent or chronic pancreatitis, hereditary causes should be explored. Imaging with abdominal computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is important to establish the extent of the pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expert opinion varies about whether to perform an ERCP after an initial attack of pancreatitis in children in whom the noninvasive test is unrevealing. In some centers, ERCP is performed in such patients. In other centers, ERCP is performed only if the pancreatitis is recurrent. (See <a href=\"#H565565439\" class=\"local\">'Indications for ERCP'</a> above.) &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 6 to 18 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis in children, a biliary cyst is responsible. Most such children have an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ) in which the pancreaticobiliary union is located outside the duodenal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51092%7EPEDS%2F62147\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51092 graphicRef62147 \">figure 1A-B</a>). This anomaly is associated with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Therapeutic ERCP is helpful for most of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Biliary cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreas divisum occurs in approximately 7 percent of individuals. It is more common among children with recurrent pancreatitis. However, most patients with pancreas divisum do not develop pancreatic disease. Endoscopic treatment of pancreas divisum is generally reserved for patients whose symptoms are recurrent and disabling. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pancreas divisum'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other congenital anomalies that may be associated with pancreatitis include annular pancreas, &quot;short pancreas&quot;, cystic dilation of the pancreatic duct, pancreatocele, and duodenal duplication cysts. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other pancreatic congenital anomalies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Duodenal duplication cysts'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is found in approximately 10 percent of children with recurrent pancreatitis, but a causal association has not been established. The diagnosis is established by performing manometry during ERCP. Sphincterotomy of both the biliary and pancreatic sphincters improves symptoms in some but not all patients with abnormal manometry results. However, sphincterotomy performed for this purpose also frequently triggers an episode of acute pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with chronic pancreatitis, the only indication for therapeutic ERCP is abdominal pain. ERCP may be used to remove intraductal stones, dilate strictures, and for pancreatic sphincterotomy, maneuvers which can help decompress the pancreatic duct and improve the abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"#H565563927\" class=\"local\">'Chronic pancreatitis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic treatment of large pancreatic pseudocysts or pancreatic trauma is based on experience in adults. These disorders also are amenable to endoscopic treatment in children. Appropriate patient selection and a high level of expertise in therapeutic ERCP are essential.
