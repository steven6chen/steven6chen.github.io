Amoxicillin is often preferred for young children because the taste of the amoxicillin suspension is more palatable than that of penicillin. A once-daily extended-release tablet is also available. In several randomized trials, standard-dose and extended-release amoxicillin appeared to have equivalent efficacy as oral penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a history of acute rheumatic fever, options include oral penicillin, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, or single-dose intramuscular (IM) benzathine penicillin. Because adherence is critical for patients with a history of acute rheumatic fever, we base our choice on patient values and preferences. While IM benzathine penicillin can be given as a single dose, the drug is expensive, frequently unavailable, and causes injection site pain. In contrast, oral options are readily available but carry the risk of incomplete adherence.</p><p/><p>The duration of therapy for oral penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> is 10 days.

The effect of longer versus shorter courses of penicillin has not been directly evaluated for the prevention of complications of streptococcal pharyngitis. However, complications can be severe and are likely related to the presence of the organism in the oropharynx; therefore, treatment with a 10-day course seems prudent.</p><p>IM penicillin appears to be more effective than oral penicillin at eradication of GAS from the oropharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and has been most well studied for the prevention of acute rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, as noted above, IM penicillin is expensive and not always available.

As examples, if penicillin was used for initial treatment, we use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> or a first-generation cephalosporin; if a first-generation cephalosporin was used, we select a later-generation cephalosporin. The rationale for this strategy is based on clinical data that suggest relapse rates may be lower with cephalosporin use, as well as scientific observations that antibiotics with greater beta-lactamase activity may be more effective in eradicating GAS from the oropharynx.

Because chronic GAS carriage can occur after antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>], we generally avoid testing in patients whose symptoms are highly consistent with viral pharyngitis (eg, sore throat accompanied by cough, conjunctivitis, or rhinorrhea) or other etiology. For patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms consistent with GAS pharyngitis, a positive test result should raise suspicion for any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonadherence with the prescribed antimicrobial regimen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent infection, which refers to new infection with the initial infecting strain or a new strain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent infection, also termed treatment failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with a different pathogen superimposed on chronic GAS carriage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a suppurative complication, such as a peritonsillar abscess</p><p/><p>Distinguishing among these states is typically based on epidemiologic and clinical history, which can be challenging as symptoms overlap and GAS testing can be positive in all.</p><p>Suspicion for recurrent infection should be raised when clusters of GAS infections are occurring within the patient's household, school, workplace, or other close-contact setting. Symptoms associated with recurrent infection with the same serotype may be milder than with the initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Initial antibiotic choice may also influence the likelihood of recurrent or persistent infection. Selection of an antibiotic to which there is potential GAS resistance, such as a macrolide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, increases the likelihood of treatment failure. Additionally, some studies suggest that cephalosporins may be more effective than penicillin for preventing relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The presence of persistent or recurrent symptoms should also raise suspicion for an alternate initial diagnosis or new infection with a different pathogen in a chronic GAS carrier. For patients with repeated episodes of pharyngitis, culturing for GAS when patients are between episodes may help distinguish chronic carriage from active infection. A positive culture in an asymptomatic patients suggests that the patient is a carrier and that symptoms are due to an alternate cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61935\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61935 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63398 \">table 4</a>).

Selection among these agents is based on the nature of the drug allergy or intolerance and local antibiotic resistance rates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64596 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F115983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115983 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F115985\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115985 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Most patients can return to work, school, or daycare after 12 to 24 hours of antibiotic therapy, provided they are afebrile and otherwise well. (See <a href=\"#H1081487144\" class=\"local\">'Resolution of symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test of cure is usually not needed for patients who are asymptomatic at the end of a course of antibiotic therapy, except for those with a history of acute rheumatic fever or in other special circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H3838403290\" class=\"local\">'Indications for test of cure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after completing a course of antibiotic therapy, we repeat microbiologic testing when symptoms are compatible with GAS infection. Because chronic GAS carriage can occur after antibiotic therapy, we generally avoid testing in patients who have symptoms that are more compatible with viral pharyngitis or other etiology. (See <a href=\"#H3972918375\" class=\"local\">'Persistent or recurrent symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with microbiologically proven recurrent or persistent GAS pharyngitis, we repeat a 10-day course of antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) and generally select an antibiotic that has greater beta-lactamase stability than the one used initially. Tonsillectomy is rarely indicated for such patients. (See <a href=\"#H1615325577\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4081770073\" class=\"local\">'Tonsillectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis is used for patients with a history of acute rheumatic fever because these patients are at high risk for recurrence and for the development of chronic valvular heart disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for chronic carriers, except in special circumstances.
