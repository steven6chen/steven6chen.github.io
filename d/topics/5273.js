There is no blood test that is specific for RPC.</p><p>A spectrum of histologic findings may be present in involved organs. The specific findings depend, in part, on the timing of the biopsy. Histopathologic findings upon biopsy of the auricular cartilage during active disease are pathognomonic, while an auricle with advanced disease and deformity reveals fibrosis. The pathologic features of auricular chondritis and lesions of the aorta, tracheobronchial tree, synovium, kidneys, and eye are presented separately.

An auricular biopsy should generally be performed in situations where the patient does not have a multiorgan cartilaginous inflammatory syndrome or fails to respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. The pathologic findings in RPC are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For example, a patient with ear, nasal cartilage, and tracheal inflammation would not need a confirmatory biopsy. By contrast, a patient with unilateral auricular inflammation not completely responding to an antibiotic and then a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> trial should usually undergo a biopsy. In the latter situation, an infiltrating disorder of the skin such as leukemia cutis or cutaneous lymphoma can mimic chondritis.

Such consultation should also be obtained in all patients once RPC has been diagnosed. (See <a href=\"#H2074935438\" class=\"local\">'All patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ophthalmology consultation</strong> &ndash; Patients with eye symptoms or signs, such as redness, pain, or photophobia, should be referred to ophthalmology for examination and diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary function tests and chest computed tomography</strong> &ndash; In patients with cough, dyspnea, stridor, or wheezing pulmonary function tests including an inspiratory loop should be obtained, and computed tomography (CT) of the chest including expiratory images is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Synovial fluid analysis</strong> &ndash; Joint aspiration and synovial fluid analysis should be performed in patients with mono- or oligoarticular inflammatory arthritis to exclude crystalline or infectious etiologies for these clinical findings. Synovial fluid testing should include cell counts, differential white blood cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystal search.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1332955255\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is distinguished from other diseases that can mimic one or more of its features by the coexistence of usually widespread, potentially destructive inflammatory lesions involving cartilaginous structures throughout the body, organs of special sense, and the cardiovascular system. However, the variable, unpredictable expression of clinical features over time may make the diagnosis difficult to establish and to distinguish from other conditions with similar manifestations. The differential diagnosis depends upon the region involved clinically.

The absence of regional lymphadenopathy should trigger the suspicion of a noninfectious process such as RPC. Leukemia cutis and lymphoma may also present as unilateral auricular chondritis. These conditions can be distinguished by biopsy and culture from RPC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis </strong>&ndash; On occasion, chondrodermatitis helicis nodularis, an inflammatory and degenerative skin lesion of unknown etiology, may cause confusion because of its histologic resemblance to RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Its more localized, circumscribed distribution and the absence of other features of disease assist in the differentiation.

Unlike RPC, the manifestations do not persist for days and the episodes do not respond to antiinflammatory therapies. Patients with this condition frequently report a history of migraine, temporomandibular, or trigeminal pain disorders. Older patients may have symptomatic cervical spondylosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H808290705\"><span class=\"h2\">Saddle nose deformity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chondritis with destruction of nasal cartilage and the potential development of a saddle nose deformity, although characteristic of RPC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80564\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80564 \">picture 3</a>), may also be induced by an infectious granulomatous lesion, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's), lymphomatoid granulomatosis, carcinoma, or lymphoma. In addition to the clinical findings associated with these other conditions, a useful differentiating feature is the absence of mucosal inflammation in RPC.

The chief complaint is invariably the sudden onset of a severe sore throat in a previously healthy individual. Death may quickly ensue if the diagnosis is not promptly established and appropriate therapy instituted. The diagnosis of epiglottitis can be made by direct visualization of the epiglottis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epiglottitis-supraglottitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other conditions of the airway</strong> &ndash; Airway lesions may result from trauma induced by endotracheal intubation, neoplastic disease, GPA, the saber-sheath trachea associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or the rare tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica characterized by osseocartilaginous mucosal nodules which project into the lumen of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Biopsy to distinguish GPA from RPC is usually not necessary due to other systemic manifestations that may be present that respectively characterize each condition and the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which characterize GPA. Rarely, isolated subglottic stenosis may be the sole manifestation of limited GPA, and biopsy confirming the presence of granulomatous inflammation can be helpful.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for cardiac involvement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, findings in other patients may occasionally also suggest the need for a CT of the chest; as an example, a patient with laboratory evidence of a systemic inflammatory response that is greater than expected based upon the clinical manifestations that are evident may have an occult aortitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong> &ndash; In patients with abnormal spirometry or CT scanning, a bronchoscopy should be obtained if the finding would assist in diagnosis or management. As an example, in patients with segmental stenosis of the bronchial tree revealed by CT scanning, bronchoscopy should be performed to eliminate alternative diagnoses, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis affecting the airway. (See <a href=\"#H4071742339\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest</strong> &ndash; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest is generally not required to establish the diagnosis of RPC. However, MRI of the chest can distinguish areas of inflammation from chronic structural abnormalities; thus, findings on MRI can be useful to determine when more aggressive therapy is required in individuals with airway symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Echocardiography</strong> &ndash; In patients with CT evidence of aortitis or cardiomegaly, a baseline transthoracic echocardiogram should be obtained.

These include fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(FDG-PET)/CT</span> and other studies.

At least half of patients with RPC have another associated inflammatory disorder. Testing would be based upon the requirements for monitoring the other illness such as rheumatoid arthritis or an ANCA vasculitis. One subset of patients who present an ongoing diagnostic challenge are older patients with a refractory anemia not responding to antiinflammatory therapies.

Imaging studies can provide important information noninvasively in the evaluation of the larynx and trachea. Pulmonary function testing and chest radiography should be obtained in all patients (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiography'</a> below). Other studies depend upon the findings of the individual patient.

A complete spirometric evaluation should include both maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55235 \">figure 1</a>).

By contrast, inspiratory obstruction correlates poorly with bronchoscopic findings in the extrathoracic airway.

CT scanning is more useful than conventional tomograms and laryngotracheograms in evaluating laryngotracheal bronchial wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and cartilaginous calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. As a result, it can usually provide an explanation for hoarseness, dysphagia, or respiratory distress in patients with RPC.</p><p>Attention to the technique of performing the CT scan may be important. Changes in the caliber of the tracheobronchial tree may be missed if the CT scan is only performed during inspiration (which is the usual method). This was illustrated in a report of 18 patients with RPC who were referred for airway imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The majority of patients exhibited expiratory CT abnormalities, but only one-half had abnormalities on routine inspiratory CT scans. Thus, selected slices covering at least the major airways should be obtained in expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80171\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80171 \">image 1</a>). A three-dimensional reconstruction of the tracheobronchial images may be useful.</p><p>The CT scan is partially limited by its inability to distinguish fibrosis from inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI, with its multiplanar imaging capability and superior soft tissue contrast, is particularly useful for evaluating the trachea and larynx in patients with RPC. It distinguishes fibrosis from inflammation (in contrast to CT) and inflammation from edema, even in the presence of subclinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>There are two potential limitations to MRI. The length of time required for imaging may create a problem in the patient with respiratory compromise, and there may be low anatomical resolution due to image degradation caused by respiratory motion. The utility of MRI for follow-up in a patient with inflammation documented on bronchoscopy has not been established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Other imaging techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other imaging techniques have been used in small series or case reports, including gallium radionuclide imaging, technetium (99mTc) methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy, endobronchial ultrasonography, and PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-20</a>]. The value of these techniques in routine clinical practice is not established.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> may have a future role for staging the extent of disease as it has been demonstrated to detect asymptomatic cartilage involvement and, most importantly, may be more sensitive than CT for detecting early treatment responsive tracheobronchial lesions not seen on standard CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning using FDG (<sup>18</sup>F; <sup>18</sup>F-FDG) has been shown to be a potentially useful diagnostic technique in case reports and small case series only, but may detect changes in the absence of symptoms or findings in some affected regions (eg, nasal and bronchial chondritis); further research with this technique is warranted prior to its use in routine clinical practice. Another limitation of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is that, at times, it may also fail to reveal changes evident by other techniques, including bronchoscopy. However, unlike CT scanning, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> has the advantage of noninvasive detection of active laryngotracheal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The majority of patients with an abnormal laryngotracheal <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> also have abnormalities on standard CT imaging. A potential role for this technique may be to follow the treatment response in the airway, while avoiding the need for bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4071742339\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopy may be a high-risk procedure in individuals whose airways are already substantially compromised.

All patients should have baseline electrocardiography and chest plain film radiography (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiography'</a> above); additional studies are indicated in selected patients. The following findings may be seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest imaging</strong> &ndash; A chest radiograph or CT may disclose cardiomegaly or may identify aortic arch widening or prominence of the ascending or descending aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrocardiography</strong> &ndash; Arrhythmic events secondary to myocarditis or myocardial ischemia can be detected on the electrocardiogram. Holter monitoring may be required to document and define the nature of such events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Echocardiography</strong> &ndash; Doppler echocardiography is the method of choice for the evaluation of cardiac valve status, for measurement of the degree of valvular regurgitation, and for imaging of left ventricular size and function. A baseline transthoracic echocardiogram should be obtained in all patients with CT evidence of aortitis or cardiomegaly. Echocardiography can be deferred in other patients unless their symptoms, examination, or imaging change over time, raising a concern for valvular disease. Early valvular involvement may be asymptomatic, but hemodynamically significant aortic or mitral regurgitation is rarely present at initial diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other testing for vascular involvement</strong> &ndash; Enlargement of the ascending aorta can be further assessed by transesophageal echocardiography or by MRI. The latter can also be used to locate aneurysmal dilatation along the course of the aorta. Invasive procedures such as aortography and coronary angiography may be indicated for the evaluation of vasculitis or aneurysms. However, their use may be potentially dangerous because of increased fragility of the vessel wall. Vascular injury can induce a false aneurysm, dissection, or thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is a systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammatory/degenerative</span> disease process that may potentially compromise the structural and functional integrity of cartilage, organs of special sense, and the cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76071 \">table 1</a>).
