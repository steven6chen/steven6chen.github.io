The administration of Rh(D) immunoglobulin to Rh-negative mothers in the late 1960s dramatically decreased the incidence of neonatal Rh isoimmune hemolytic disease. At about the same time, the introduction of phototherapy in the United States significantly reduced the need for exchange transfusions and the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia. Thus, the risk of kernicterus was reduced from its peak in the 1950s through the 1970s. Nevertheless, isolated cases of kernicterus, a mostly preventable condition, continue to be reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

However, to provide a more accurate clinical prediction, we have calculated an estimated risk of kernicterus for infants with TB &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (513 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> using population-based data, which were gathered when therapy for hyperbilirubinemia was provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In Great Britain and Denmark, for example, the incidence of TB &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (513 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> was 1 in 14,084 live births and in 1 in 10,000 live births, respectively, and the concurrent incidence of kernicterus was 1 in 100,000 live births and 1.4 in 100,000 live births, respectively. We would predict based on these data that the risk of kernicterus for infants with TB&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (513 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> would range from 14 to 25 percent.</p><p>Similarly, we estimated the risk for kernicterus for infants with TB &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (428 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> using population-based data.

This approach is consistent with the AAP guidelines and is built upon two key elements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Universal clinical assessment for the presence of jaundice and risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64584 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate follow-up based upon risk assessment and the infant's age at the time of discharge</p><p/><p>Instituting such an approach decreases the prevalence of severe hyperbilirubinemia. This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 101,272 infants cared for in 18 nurseries before and after a bilirubin newborn screening program was established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The prevalence of severe hyperbilirubinemia (total serum or plasma bilirubin [TB] &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [342 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> decreased from 1.2 to 0.7 percent, which suggests that universal screening might have led to an increase in early intervention, thus preventing hyperbilirubinemia. The rate of readmission for jaundice also decreased from 0.5 to 0.4 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Which infants require evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision of which infants require a measurement of TB or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) is dependent on clinical findings of jaundice and risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia, including whether the infant is breast- or formula-fed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Jaundice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All term and late preterm infants should be routinely assessed for the presence of jaundice every 8 to 12 hours while in the hospital.</p><p>Infants who are jaundiced before 24 hours of life are at increased risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia, often due to isoimmune hemolytic disease. In these infants, a TB or TcB measurement should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Total serum or plasma bilirubin (TB)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Transcutaneous bilirubin'</a> below.)</p><p>For infants &gt;24 hours of age, a TB or TcB is measured when jaundice appears excessive for age (eg, jaundice below the level of the umbilicus) because visual assessment is not as reliable as TB measurement to detect significant hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A measurement of TB or TcB in <strong>all</strong> infants before discharge will also help to identify those who are at risk for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. TB can be measured at the time of the newborn screening for metabolic disorders, thus obviating the need for an additional blood sample, although there are additional costs involved. As a result, in our practice, universal screening by measuring TB is performed in all neonates prior to discharge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Jaundice and conjunctival icterus'</a>.)</p><p>TB and TcB measurements are interpreted according to the infant's age based upon predictive data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70863 \">figure 1</a>). Normative data for the first week of life after birth do not exist because of variations in clinical practice regarding feeding, the ability to screen and identify hemolytic diseases (increased bilirubin production), and efforts to facilitate bilirubin elimination. Data provided in the linked figure for ages 12 to 72 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70863\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70863 \">figure 1</a>) are the closest to normative data (but excludes infants who phototherapy has been used).</p><p>Data collected by TcB measurements are further confounded by the discrepancies between TB and TcB values above 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (205 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Thus, TcB nomograms can underestimate TB levels &gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (205 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L)</span> and the correlation to TB are variable (see <a href=\"#H635819290\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of TcB'</a> below).

Prediction of severe hyperbilirubinemia is based upon a bilirubin measurement (TB or TcB) and detection of additional risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (eg, isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency) and neurotoxicity factors (asphyxia, lethargy, temperature instability, sepsis, acidosis, or albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In order to identify and treat infants at risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia, we use a systematic approach to screen all term and late preterm infants as outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Systematic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are insufficient data that bilirubin screening will prevent kernicterus, experts in the field, including the authors, believe that severe hyperbilirubinemia is an acceptable clinical surrogate for kernicterus. In our practice, we perform universal bilirubin screening and clinical risk assessment for all neonates before discharge to identify infants at high risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia. Alternatively, selective screening can be performed in which the need for bilirubin testing is determined by the presence of clinical risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64584 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H635818703\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Universal screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Selective screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TB and transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements can both be used to monitor bilirubin levels. However, TcB screening may not accurately reflect TB in infants who are dark- (overestimation) or light-skinned (underestimation), with higher bilirubin concentrations (TcB measurements underestimate TB), or in those who are undergoing or have discontinued phototherapy. As a result, TcB needs to be confirmed by measuring TB in patients with high TB, prior to initiation of a therapeutic intervention, or when there is an alteration of management based on bilirubin. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Total serum or plasma bilirubin (TB)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Transcutaneous bilirubin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with TB &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age are at increased risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia and BIND. The risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia and the threshold for intervention based upon the hour-specific bilirubin value, the presence of additional risk factors, and the gestational age may be determined using the newborn hyperbilirubinemia assessment calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-newborn-hyperbilirubinemia-assessment\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with TB &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile or suspicion of hemolytic disease require subsequent measurement(s) of TB and further evaluation to determine the etiology of jaundice. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to discharge, risk assessment for severe hyperbilirubinemia should be performed, which (along with the age of the patient at discharge) guides the timing of the initial follow-up appointment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64584\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64584 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65147 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the time of discharge, appropriate follow-up is arranged, information and written guidelines about jaundice are provided to the parents, and instructions for when to contact medical staff are given to the family. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the follow-up appointment, the infant's weight and percent change from birth weight, adequacy of intake, pattern of voiding and stooling, and the presence or absence of jaundice are assessed. Clinical judgment based upon the infant's appearance and the interval medical history is used to determine the need for bilirubin measurement. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although breastfeeding may be associated with persistent hyperbilirubinemia, the benefits of breastfeeding are well established so that breastfeeding should be promoted and supported for term and late preterm infants.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dennery PA, Seidman DS, Stevenson DK.
