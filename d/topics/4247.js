They also have a higher chance of suicide than people who do not use cocaine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4025157\"><span class=\"h1\">Who uses illegal cocaine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 2 percent of Americans older than 14 use illegal cocaine. Most users are men ages 15 to 35 who live in cities. Some people use cocaine only once in a while. But others take large amounts over short periods of time. This is called a &quot;binge.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H793809507\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cocaine use disorder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine use disorder is basically the medical term for cocaine addiction. It can be mild to severe. People with cocaine use disorder have 2 or more of the following problems. The more of these they have, the more severe their disorder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They end up using more cocaine than they planned to, or they use it for longer than they planned to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They wish they could cut down on cocaine, but they can't.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They spend a lot of time trying to get cocaine, getting high, or recovering from being high.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They crave or have a strong desire or urge to use cocaine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of their cocaine use, they often don't do things that they need to or that are expected of them, such as go to work or school, remember family events, and clean their home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep using cocaine even if it causes or worsens problems in their relationships or interactions with other people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They stop or cut back on important social, work, or fun activities they used to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep using cocaine even in situations where it is dangerous to do so (such as while driving).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep using cocaine even when they know they have a physical or mental problem that was probably caused or made worse by their drug use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They need to use more and more cocaine to get the same effects they used to get with less. Or they get less effect from using the amount that used to get them high. This is called &quot;tolerance.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; if they stop using cocaine after using it for a long time. Withdrawal symptoms can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling sad or depressed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Having dreams that are unpleasant and seem very real</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sleeping too little or too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hunger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Being restless or moving little or slowly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4025206\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cocaine addiction treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, treatment involves addiction counseling and taking part in a support group.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Addiction counseling &ndash; People with addiction work with a counselor to better understand their addiction. They learn new ways to lead their life that do not involve drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support groups &ndash; In support groups, people with addiction share their experiences with each other. The most common of these groups is Cocaine Anonymous (<a href=\"http://www.ca.org/&amp;token=Fh/4dWnrlwV4E+kSewOQzhqsyL/YGb9gdhWw6vo0st0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=83740\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ca.org</a>), but some people dislike that it involves God or a &quot;higher power.&quot; There are other groups that do not have that as a focus.</p><p/><p>Some people cannot stop using cocaine even with counseling and support groups. They might benefit from a more structured treatment program that includes specific types of therapy, behavioral exercises, and routine drug testing.</p><p>There are also a few medicines that are being studied to help people stay off cocaine. There is not enough proof yet that they work, so doctors are not ready to recommend them.</p><p>For specific situations, there are other treatments. An example is family therapy, which can be especially helpful for children or teens with addiction who have families willing to participate in treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4025223\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=marijuana-use-and-addiction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Marijuana use and addiction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
