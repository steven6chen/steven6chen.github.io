The human host serves as a natural reservoir for <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. The ability of the organism to efficiently establish latent infection has enabled it to spread to nearly one-third of individuals worldwide. The World Health Organization estimated 6.3 million new cases of active TB disease to occur in 2016 with about 1.3 million deaths in HIV-uninfected people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The microbiology and pathogenesis of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> will be reviewed here. The immunology of this infection is discussed separately.

The risk of reactivation is markedly increased in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These outcomes are determined by the interplay of factors attributable to both the organism and the host.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13826076\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of our understanding of the natural course of tuberculosis (TB) comes from human autopsy data prior to the era of antituberculosis drugs and from experimental animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Among the approximately 5 to 10 percent of infected individuals who develop active disease, approximately half will do so within the first two to three years following infection.</p><p>The tubercle bacilli establish infection in the lungs after they are carried in droplets small enough to reach the alveolar space (5 to 10 microns). If the innate defense system of the host fails to eliminate the infection, the bacilli proliferate inside alveolar macrophages, which may migrate away from the lungs to enter other tissue.</p><p>While in the lungs, macrophages produce cytokines and chemokines that attract other phagocytic cells, including monocytes, other alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils, which eventually form a nodular granulomatous structure called a tubercle. If the bacterial replication is not controlled, the tubercle enlarges and the bacilli enter local draining lymph nodes. This leads to lymphadenopathy, a characteristic manifestation of primary TB. The lesion produced by the expansion of the tubercle into the lung parenchyma and lymph node involvement is called the Ghon complex. Bacteremia also may accompany initial infection.</p><p>The bacilli continue to proliferate until an effective cell-mediated immune (CMI) response develops, usually 2 to 10 weeks following initial infection; this occurs in more than 90 percent of exposed infected individuals. A successful CMI contains viable organisms at sites to which they have migrated before sensitization was achieved. In the lung, failure of the host to mount an effective CMI response and tissue repair leads to progressive destruction of lung. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, and the contents of cytotoxic cells (granzymes, perforin), which function to eliminate <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, may also contribute to collateral host cell damage and the development of caseating necrosis. Hence, much of TB pathology results from an infected host's proinflammatory immune response to the tubercle bacilli. Caseous necrosis is frequently associated with TB but can also be caused by other organisms, including syphilis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis. (See related topics.)</p><p>Unchecked bacterial growth may lead to hematogenous spread of bacilli to produce disseminated TB. Disseminated disease with lesions resembling millet seeds has been termed miliary TB. Bacilli can also spread mechanically by erosion of the caseating lesions into the airways; at this point, the host becomes infectious to others. In the absence of treatment, death ensues in up to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The remaining patients develop chronic disease or recover. Chronic disease is characterized by repeated episodes of healing by fibrotic changes around the lesions and tissue breakdown. Complete spontaneous eradication of the bacilli is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13826083\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactivation disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactivation TB results from proliferation of a previously latent bacteria seeded at the time of the primary infection. Among individuals with latent infection and no underlying medical problems, it has generally been estimated that the lifetime risk of reactivation disease after an index infection is 5 to 10 percent, with a 5 percent risk in the two to five years following infection and another 5 percent risk over the remaining lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A study from Australia of close contacts of TB cases reported a risk of 11 percent in the five years following infection; the risk rose to 14.5 percent after adjusting for death and loss to follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Immunosuppression is clearly associated with reactivation TB, although it is not clear what specific host factors maintain the infection in a latent state and what triggers the latent infection to break containment and become active. Immunosuppressive conditions associated with reactivation TB include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic and end-stage renal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant lymphoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroid use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of TNF-alpha and its receptor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminution in cell-mediated immunity associated with age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]</p><p/><p>The disease process in reactivation TB tends to be localized (in contrast with primary disease); in general, there is little regional lymph node involvement and less caseation. The lesion typically occurs at the lung apices, and disseminated disease is unusual unless the host is severely immunosuppressed.</p><p>Prior TB infection, contained as latent tuberculosis, confers protection against subsequent TB disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One review evaluating 23 paired cohorts (total more than 19,000 individuals) noted that individuals with latent tuberculosis had 79 percent lower risk of progressive tuberculosis following reinfection compared with uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, prior TB disease is associated with an increased risk of subsequent TB disease. Studies in both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals with one episode of active TB have noted a two- to fourfold increased risk of a second episode of active TB compared with individuals without prior active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A study from South Africa including 612 patients treated for TB documented recurrent disease in 18 percent of cases over a five-year follow-up period; recurrence occurred after successful treatment in 14 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. By comparing DNA fingerprints of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> isolates from the first and second episodes of TB, the investigators showed that 77 percent of the recurrences were new infections rather than relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The rate of reinfection TB was four times the rate of new TB. The increased risk of active disease in those with prior TB may be a reflection of the high prevalence of the disease and therefore high transmission frequency in a community with a large number of high-risk hosts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. tuberculosis</em> belongs to the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em>, which includes more than 50 other species, often collectively referred to as nontuberculous mycobacteria. Tuberculosis (TB) is defined as a disease caused by members of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex, which include the tubercle bacillus (<em>M. tuberculosis</em>), <em>M. bovis</em>, <em>M. africanum</em>, <em>M. microti</em>, <em>M. canetti</em>, <em>M. caprae</em>, <em>M. pinnipedii, </em>and <em>M. orygis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of nontuberculous mycobacteria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell envelope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cell envelope is a distinguishing feature of the organisms belonging to the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em>. The mycobacterial cell envelope is composed of a core of three macromolecules covalently linked to each other (peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and mycolic acids) and a lipopolysaccharide, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which is thought to be anchored to the plasma membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The outermost layer, the mycobacterial outer membrane (MOM), consists of a lipid bilayer structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Mycolic acid, a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, is the major constituent of the cell envelope, accounting for more than 50 percent by weight; this structure defines the genus. Glycolipids are attached to the outside of the envelope layer through a connection to the mycolic acid layer; proteins are also embedded in this cell wall complex. Glycolipid components are implicated in &quot;cord formation,&quot; whereby tuberculosis bacilli clump together forming a serpiginous structure seen on microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staining characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cell wall components give <em>Mycobacterium</em> its characteristic staining properties. The organism stains positive with Gram stain. The mycolic acid structure confers the ability to resist destaining by acid alcohol after being stained by certain aniline dyes, leading to the term acid-fast bacillus (AFB).</p><p>Microscopy to detect AFB (using Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun stain) is the most commonly used procedure to diagnose TB in the world, especially in developing countries with limited laboratory capacity. A specimen must contain at least 10<sup>4</sup> colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFU)/mL</span> to yield a positive smear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Microscopy of specimens stained with a fluorochrome dye (such as auramine O) provides an easier, more efficient, and approximately a 10-fold more sensitive alternative. However, microscopic detection of mycobacteria does not distinguish <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from nontuberculous mycobacteria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A distinguishing feature of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is its slow growth rate. In artificial media and animal tissues, its generation time is about 20 to 24 hours (as opposed to 20 minutes for organisms such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolation in the laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial media used to cultivate <em>M. tuberculosis</em> include potato- and egg-based media, such as Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11, or albumin in an agar base, such as the L&ouml;wenstein-Jensen medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A liquid medium, such as Middlebrook 7H9, is used for subcultures and for propagating the bacillus to extract DNA for molecular diagnostic and strain-typing procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three to four weeks are required to recover the organism, depending on the initial quantity of organisms in the specimen.</p><p>Broth-based culture systems to improve the speed and sensitivity of detection exist. The BACTEC 460 system is based upon Middlebrook 7H12 medium containing 14C palmitic acid with a mixture of antibiotics (PANTA) to suppress other bacterial growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The addition of NAP (p-nitro-alpha-acetylamino-beta-hydroxypropiophenone) in the medium suppresses growth of other <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex organisms, such as <em>M. bovis</em>, but does not differentiate <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from other nontuberculous mycobacteria. BACTEC 460 has been phased out by its manufacturer.</p><p>Bacterial growth is indicated by the detection of 14C released by <em>M. tuberculosis</em> as it metabolizes the palmitic acid. In AFB smear-positive specimens, the BACTEC system can detect <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in approximately 8 days (compared with approximately 14 days for smear-negative specimens) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, the high cost of the equipment and the need for radioactive material that requires disposal exclude its use in most endemic settings.</p><p>Other broth-based systems include Septi-Chek AFB (BBL) and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Septi-Chek AFB is a biphasic system comprised of a capped bottle containing modified Middlebrook 7H9 broth under CO<sub>2</sub> and a paddle coated with solid agar, such as Middlebrook 7H11 and L&ouml;wenstein-Jensen media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The recovery rate of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex from AFB smear-negative specimens by this procedure is about 15 to 30 percent higher than conventional media, and the average number of days to recovery is two to five days shorter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The MGIT 960 system used in the United States is based on Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing silicon rubber impregnated with ruthenium pentahydrate that serves as a fluorescence-quenching oxygen sensor. As oxygen is consumed by metabolizing bacteria, fluorescence of the liquid growth medium is detected visually. Among smear-negative samples in a study of 1500 clinical specimens, the recovery rate of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex was about 15 percent less by the MGIT system (68 percent) compared with that obtained by the radiometric BACTEC system, but the mean time to detection was similar (9.9 versus 9.7 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The lack of need for expensive instrumentation and radioactive materials renders MGIT widely acceptable and suitable in many laboratories.</p><p>A similar broth-based and colorimetric detection system is the <span class=\"nowrap\">MB/BacT</span> system. In this system, a colorimetric sensor is embedded at the bottom of a bottle, and, when carbon dioxide is produced by a growing microorganism, the sensor changes from dark green to yellow. This change in color is monitored continuously by a detection device. A systematic review of this system (compared with the BACTEC 460) found that the <span class=\"nowrap\">MB/BacT</span> system had a sensitivity of 96 to 100 percent and a specificity of 78 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Identification of the organism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the organism is isolated, identification is based on morphologic and biochemical characteristics, although nucleic acid&ndash;based detection methods have obviated many of the conventional tests. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is identified by its rough, nonpigmented, so-called &quot;corded&quot; colonies on albumin-based agars. It is typically positive in the niacin test, has a weak catalase activity, which is inactivated at 68&ordm;C, and reduces nitrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The only other major slow-growing <em>Mycobacterium </em>that is niacin test&ndash;positive is <em>M. simiae</em>. Although all members of the mycobacteria species produce niacin (usually undetectable by the niacin test), the differences in the activity of the enzymes involved in the salvage pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> determines niacin positivity in <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. Niacin accumulates in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> because nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to niacin, is several-fold more active, and the enzyme that recycles niacin to produce NAD is less active than in members of most other mycobacterial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The niacin, nitrate reductase, and catalase tests are the three biochemical tests most frequently used to distinguish <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from other mycobacterial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Tests for pyrazinamidase production as well as susceptibility to thiophen-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH) will distinguish <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from <em>M. bovis</em>, another member of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex. <em>M. bovis</em> does not express pyrazinamidase (or nicotinamidase) and is susceptible to less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> of TCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,36</a>]. Clinical isolates of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> lacking pyrazinamidase activity have been described that contain nucleotide point mutations in the gene (<em>pncA</em>) that encodes pyrazinamidase; these isolates are resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> (PZA), one of the first-line drugs used to treat TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

With <em>M. tuberculosis,</em> these factors may include cell wall lipids, proteins, and their regulatory factors; secreted proteins and their regulators; lipid transporters; metabolic pathways; and other proteins of unknown function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Virulence factors may also be identified epidemiologically by comparing <em>M. tuberculosis</em> strains implicated in community outbreaks to other less frequently represented clinical or laboratory strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/51-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-57</a>].</p><p>One common approach to study virulence phenotype of an intracellular pathogen is to identify bacterial surface products that mediate uptake of the organism into non-phagocytic cells.

In the early 1990s, a similar approach was used to identify a protein (known as mycobacterial cell entry protein, or Mce1A) that conferred upon a nonpathogenic <em>E. coli</em> an ability to invade HeLa cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The significance of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> entering epithelial cells in TB pathogenesis is not clear; most studies examining <em>M. tuberculosis</em>&ndash;mammalian cell interactions focus on professional phagocytic cells (macrophages and dendritic cells). It should be noted, however, that the initial site of lung infection by <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is the alveolar air space, which is composed of type I and type II pneumocytes; these are epithelial cells. Type I cells comprise about 96 percent of the alveolar surface area; type II cells cover about 4 percent of the surface area but comprise 60 percent of all the alveolar epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Thus, <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is most likely to encounter and enter pneumocytes before they are taken up by alveolar macrophages.

When <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is grown under microaerophilic conditions, a state called nonreplicating, persistent (NRP1) is produced and glycine dehydrogenase activity is induced. In contrast, growth under anaerobic conditions produces a state called NRP2 in which glycine dehydrogenase activity decreases, but the organism still survives as long as the loss of oxygen occurred slowly and it passed through the NRP1 stage for a period of time. When oxygen is reintroduced to organisms grown anaerobically, the pathogen goes out of the NRP2 state. Such an in vitro system could potentially be used to examine differential gene expression and thus to identify bacterial factors specifically required under these growth conditions.</p><p>Bacterial survival in stationary phase growth is sometimes used as an in vitro model for studying intracellular persistence.

This gene is a homologue of alternate sigma factor gene (<em>rpoS</em>), which is important for stationary phase survival of <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Salmonella </em>spp. In <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, <em>sigF</em> is expressed during stationary phase, nitrogen depletion, and cold shock but not during exponential phase growth.</p><p>One study identified at least seven proteins specifically expressed during the stationary phase growth of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>; the predominant expressed protein was an alpha-crystallin-like heat shock protein (<em>acr</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. <em>Acr</em> transcript was also induced in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> inside macrophages; <em>acr </em>gene replacement by homologous recombination in <em>M. tuberculosis</em> H37Rv led to impaired growth of the organism inside mouse bone marrow&ndash;derived macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].

This study suggested that an <em>M. tuberculosis</em> strain that causes mild lung disease may allow individuals with subclinical disease to be under recognized in the community and therefore more time to spread infection in the population. Therefore, such strains would be overly represented in a community.

However, subsequently, many clinical multidrug-resistant strains have been shown to have mutations in the RNA polymerase gene associated with high competitive fitness in vitro and high fitness in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. In regions of the world with a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR-) TB, up to 30 percent of their MDR isolates had such mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">HOST FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility to infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic analysis of sibling pairs has been used to evaluate putative genetic markers for enhanced susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) in populations in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Possible markers on chromosomes 15q and Xq were identified; the investigators speculate that finding a susceptibility gene on an X chromosome may partially explain the increased incidence of TB in males in some populations.</p><p>In a mouse model, a locus on chromosome 19 was found to regulate replication of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in the lungs of <span class=\"nowrap\">DBA/2</span> mice that die rapidly of TB compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">C57BL/6</span> mice, which are more resistant to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. In a second study in a mouse model, a single isoform of the intracellular pathogen resistance 1 gene (<em>Ipr1</em>) was found to be responsible for the increased resistance to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. Resistance was characterized by smaller lung lesions containing fewer macrophages, slower <em>M. tuberculosis</em> growth in macrophages, and death of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>&ndash;infected macrophages by apoptosis rather than necrosis.</p><p>The closest human homologue to <em>lpr1</em> is <em>SP110</em>. A study of families from Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Guinea identified three polymorphisms in the <em>SP110</em> gene that are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired susceptibility to infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigators examined the interferon (IFN)-gamma response pathway in three patients with severe, unexplained nontuberculous mycobacterial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. In all three patients, IFN-gamma was undetectable following stimulation of whole blood but was detectable when stimulated in the absence of the patients' own plasma. An autoantibody against IFN-gamma was isolated from the patients' plasma and was found to be capable of blocking the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production in response to endotoxin, in blocking induction of IFN-gamma&ndash;inducible genes, and in inhibiting upregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These acquired defects in the IFN-gamma pathway may explain unusual susceptibilities to intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, in patients without underlying, genetically determined immunologic defects.</p><p>All of the host genes associated with TB susceptibility account for a tiny fraction of all tuberculosis cases identified in the world. The most important host factor that determines TB susceptibility to TB is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, followed by other immunosuppressive conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and immunosuppressive medications. Environmental factors, such as crowding, low socioeconomic status, poor access to healthcare, and family history, also contribute substantially to the incidence of TB worldwide, and these are important to understanding TB pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1702519057\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression from latent infection to active disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host factors in progression from latent infection to active disease have been described in several reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/159,160\" class=\"abstract_t\">159,160</a>]. One large study in Africa attempted to identify host biosignatures predictive of progression from latent TB infection to disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. The investigators prospectively followed South African adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who were infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> and compared the blood RNA biosignatures of those who developed TB during the follow-up period with those who did not. The 16 biomarkers identified were found to show a sensitivity and specificity of 54 and 83 percent, respectively, for predicting progression to TB within 12 months preceding TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13826771\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalation of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and deposition in the lungs leads to one of four possible outcomes: immediate clearance of the organism, primary disease (rapid progression to active disease), latent infection (with or without subsequent reactivation disease), or reactivation disease (onset of active disease many years following a period of latent infection). (See <a href=\"#H13826069\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cell envelope is a distinguishing feature of the organisms belonging to the genus <em>Mycobacterium</em>. Mycolic acid is the major constituent of the cell envelope; this structure defines the genus. The mycolic acid structure confers the ability to resist destaining by acid alcohol after being stained by certain aniline dyes, leading to the term acid-fast bacillus. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cell envelope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopy to detect acid-fast bacillus (using Ziehl-Neelsen or Kinyoun stain) is a commonly used procedure for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB); a specimen must contain at least 10<sup>4</sup> colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFU)/mL</span> to yield a positive smear. Microscopy of specimens stained with a fluorochrome dye (such as auramine O provides) is a more sensitive and efficient technique. Microscopic detection of mycobacteria does not distinguish <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from nontuberculous mycobacteria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Staining characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The slow growth rate is a distinguishing feature of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. In artificial media and animal tissues, the generation time is about 20 to 24 hours, which means that cultures may take from two to six weeks for detectable growth, depending on the cultivation systems used for laboratory isolation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Isolation in the laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the organism is isolated, identification is based upon morphologic and biochemical characteristics, although nucleic acid&ndash;based detection methods have obviated many of the conventional tests. The niacin, nitrate reductase, and catalase tests are the three biochemical tests most frequently used to distinguish <em>M. tuberculosis</em> from other mycobacterial species. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Identification of the organism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following virulence factors have been described: mycolic acid glycolipids and trehalose dimycolate (which can elicit granuloma formation in animal tissue), catalase-peroxidase (which resists the host cell oxidative response), sulfatides and trehalose dimycolate (which can trigger toxicity in animal models), lipoarabinomannan (LAM; which can induce cytokines and resist host oxidative stress), and secreted proteins, including CFP10 and ESAT-6. Molecular biology techniques have identified many other gene products that may be involved in the ability of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> to enter cells, resist intracellular killing, establish persistence, inhibit host cytosolic surveillance, and come out of latency. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Virulence factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies have revealed a few key <em>M. tuberculosis</em> lineages to be overly represented or clustered in certain communities. Such occurrences may relate to these strains' distinct biological &quot;fitness&quot; or transmissibility. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differences in virulence of clinical isolates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TB pathogenesis can be influenced by host-related characteristics that determine outcomes after an infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. These may involve host genetic factors that enhance susceptibility to infection or progression to disease after exposure.
