When difficulty is expected, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> (0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> prior to airway manipulation to prevent this complication, as well as to decrease oral secretions. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3482411463\"><span class=\"h2\">Apneic oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the use of apneic oxygenation for all children thought to be at risk for prolonged or difficult intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We typically use either humidified high flow nasal cannula or a modified nasal trumpet for apneic oxygenation </p><p>Administration of oxygen into the posterior pharynx delays oxygen desaturation during periods of apnea, as occurs during prolonged intubation attempts. In apneic patients, oxygen extraction from the alveoli results in subatmospheric alveolar pressures, and if the airway is unobstructed, oxygen will be drawn in from the glottic opening.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Devices for apneic oxygenation</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>A number of devices have been described for apneic administration of oxygen in children, including humidified high-flow nasal cannulae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>], an endotracheal tube (ETT) placed through the nose into the posterior pharynx, an ETT taped to a standard laryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], laryngoscope blade with an oxygen side port [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and an ETT placed in the side channel of a videolaryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other techniques that have been described in adults, such as apneic oxygenation via a standard nasal cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or a nasal trumpet modified with an ETT adaptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] may also be used in children. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies have reported variable effectiveness of these techniques, but all would likely allow an increased margin of safety for prolonged intubation attempts. As an example, in one study, the rate of oxygen desaturation was recorded in children who were intubated with conventional DL, or with apneic oxygenation with one of two types of laryngoscope modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All children were preoxygenated with 30 percent oxygen. The time for 25 percent of patients to reach a 1 percent decrease in oxygen saturation was 30 seconds without apneic oxygenation, 67 seconds with oxygen supplementation via a laryngoscope blade with an oxygen cannula attached to the side, and 75 seconds with oxygen administered via a videolaryngoscope with an oxygen sideport. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another study, 48 children &le;2 years of age were randomly assigned to intubation with or without insufflation of oxygen through an ETT positioned in the side channel of an AirTraq videolaryngoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. After intubation, patients were left apneic until oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) fell to 95 percent. Insufflation of oxygen prolonged the mean time to desaturation by an estimated 35 seconds (95% CI, 10 to 60 seconds), from 131&plusmn;39 seconds without oxygen to 166&plusmn;47 seconds with oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High-flow nasal <span class=\"nowrap\">cannula/THRIVE</strong></span> &ndash; High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) have been used to improve oxygenation in critically ill infants and children.

Studies in infants and children have reported maintenance of normal oxygen saturation with THRIVE during prolonged periods of apnea and spontaneous ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In fact, THRIVE has been used to maintain normoxia for tubeless airway surgery lasting up to one hour. The reliability of carbon dioxide clearance with THRIVE is still unknown, with studies reporting conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/12,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19,20</a>].</p><p/><p>Theoretical and usually clinically inconsequential disadvantages to apneic oxygenation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The apneic oxygenation device may have to be removed if the intubation attempt is aborted, to allow mask ventilation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoral devices (eg, catheter taped to the laryngoscope, side ports) may obstruct the laryngeal view during laryngoscopy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen may be insufflated into the stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3342252023\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative intubation techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternatives to DL for intubation in children are similar to those that may be used in adults (eg, flexible scope intubation [FSI], videolaryngoscopy [VL], intubation through a supraglottic airway [SGA]). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appropriate advanced airway technique may depend on factors such as clinician preference and familiarity with techniques, patient size, mouth opening, neck mobility, physiologic reserve, apnea tolerance, and presence of blood or secretions in the airway. More important than the first intubation technique attempted is avoidance of repeated attempts of the same technique without adjustment. Therefore, additional equipment for secondary attempts using alternative approaches should be immediately available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VL increases intubation success in both adults and children with difficult airways. VL is faster to perform and easier to set up than a flexible scope. However, a common problem is the inability to pass the ETT through the vocal cords despite having an adequate view of the glottic opening. This is a more common problem in infants, in whom the bulky VL blade may make maneuvering the ETT into the pharynx more difficult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H727501564\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Intubation success with video laryngoscopes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FSI through a supraglottic airway may provide a first pass success rate similar to VL, with the added advantage of allowing continuous ventilation and oxygenation throughout laryngoscopy. In an analysis of data from the Pediatric Difficult Intubation (PeDI) registry that included 1603 difficult pediatric intubations, first pass success was similar overall with FSI through an SGA versus VL (59 percent for FSI through an SGA, 51 percent for VL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-pediatric-anesthesia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. First attempt success rate in infants less than one year of age was higher with FSI though an SGA than with VL (54 percent versus 36 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of an SGA facilitates unobstructed passage of the flexible intubation scope (FIS) past the soft tissue of the oropharynx, and we prefer this technique over freehand FSI. However, FSI, even through an SGA, may take longer than DL or VL, and may be difficult or impossible if there are blood or secretions in the airway. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hybrid technique using VL and FIS is increasingly being used. With this technique, the videolaryngoscope is inserted in the normal fashion. An ETT is loaded onto an FIS, which is used as a maneuverable stylet while watching the tip on the VL screen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2469086255\"><span class=\"h2\">Awake intubation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Awake intubation should be considered if there is anticipated difficulty with endotracheal intubation and in addition, any one of the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults#H3654913958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Awake intubation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both mask ventilation and SGA ventilation are likely to be difficult, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is high risk of aspiration, or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient will not tolerate an apneic period</p><p/><p>Awake intubation may be impractical for young children because of lack of cooperation.

(See <a href=\"#H2146312885\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of the pediatric difficult airway'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of difficult mask ventilation is similar in children and adults. Difficult direct laryngoscopy (DL) and endotracheal intubation are more common in very young children. (See <a href=\"#H2463070351\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of difficult pediatric airway'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with predicted difficulty with airway management, we use the following management strategy (see <a href=\"#H2395544839\" class=\"local\">'General concerns'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whenever possible, obtain intravenous (IV) access prior to induction of anesthesia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administer oxygen throughout induction of anesthesia and attempts at airway management, including during apnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limit DL to one attempt</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of apneic oxygenation for all children thought to be at risk for prolonged or difficult intubation. Options for apneic oxygenation include humidified high-flow nasal cannulae, modifications of standard or videolaryngoscopes, standard nasal cannulae, and oxygen insufflation via nasal trumpets or endotracheal tubes (ETTs) placed in the posterior pharynx. (See <a href=\"#H3482411463\" class=\"local\">'Apneic oxygenation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatives to DL include flexible scope intubation (FSI), videolaryngoscopy (VL), and intubation through a supraglottic airway (SGA). (See <a href=\"#H3342252023\" class=\"local\">'Alternative intubation techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Awake intubation should be considered in patients with predicted difficulty with intubation in addition to one of the following (see <a href=\"#H2469086255\" class=\"local\">'Awake intubation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Predicted difficulty with both mask ventilation and SGA ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High risk of aspiration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Predicted intolerance of an apneic period </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We manage the unexpected difficult pediatric airway according to the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (APA) guidelines, which stress consideration of laryngospasm as a cause for total airway obstruction during mask ventilation, limiting the number of attempts at DL, and early use of an SGA.
