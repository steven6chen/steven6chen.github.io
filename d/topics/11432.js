Abnormal excitability leading to arrhythmia can arise from acquired or inherited abnormalities of these elements. Acquired abnormalities in cardiomyopathy are called electrical remodeling. Inherited abnormalities arise from mutations in genes encoding the subunits and associated proteins of these channels and have been associated with familial arrhythmic syndromes and sudden cardiac death. Examples include the congenital long QT syndrome (sodium and potassium current), the Brugada syndrome (mainly sodium current), and congenital heart block (sodium current). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brugada-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brugada syndrome: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-atrioventricular-block#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of atrioventricular block&quot;, section on 'Familial disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac ion channels and currents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ions (sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium) flow through the cardiac membrane in channels with pores formed by proteins encoded by specific genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pore-forming protein is called the alpha subunit, which also contains the voltage dependent sensors and gates. The currents carry specific names based upon the permeant ion and distinguishing kinetics or pharmacology. In most cases, the gene and protein underlying each current has been described and each has a distinct name (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 1</a>). For example, the voltage dependent sodium current (INa) flows through the protein NaV1.5 encoded by the gene SCN5A and similarly for other ion channels. Ion channels also consist of multiple subunits (usually named beta, delta, gamma, and so on) and other accessory proteins forming a macromolecular complex that regulates the current. The sodium-potassium pump and the sodium-calcium exchanger are not considered channels because they require energy to drive ions across the membrane against their gradients, but they do generate currents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The resting potential</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal resting potential in most myocardial cells is between -80 and -95 mV, with the cell interior negative relative to the extracellular space. The resting potential of the cell is set by the balance of inward (sodium and calcium) and outward (potassium) currents and the corresponding equilibrium potentials of these currents. In turn, the equilibrium potential for a given ion is determined by the concentrations of that ion inside and outside the cell. Using these concentrations, the equilibrium potential is calculated by the Nernst equation. As an example, potassium ion concentrations are higher inside than outside the cell, and the potassium equilibrium potential is between -80 and -95 mV. When potassium channels open, potassium ions flow down their gradient as an outward current, carrying positive ions outside the cell and taking the cell toward more negative potentials.</p><p>In the heart, the resting potential is generated by the inward rectifier current IK1, which is the predominant open channel at rest. Potassium current flow through this channel continues until the interior negative potential is at the same magnitude as the equilibrium potential for potassium. Only small amounts of actual potassium flow are required to maintain this potential. The equilibrium potentials for sodium and calcium are positive (~+40 mV and ~+80 mV, respectively) so that when these channels are open, they tend to depolarize the membrane. Voltage-sensitive sodium, calcium, and potassium channels play only a small role in the resting state, since most of these channels are closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The Na-K-ATPase pump maintains the potassium and sodium gradients by pumping potassium into and sodium out of the cells. The Na-Ca exchanger uses the power of the Na gradient to pump calcium out of the cell. These and other pumps maintain the ion channel gradient that is important for both excitability and contraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Action potential in fast response tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissues that depend upon the opening of voltage-sensitive, kinetically rapid (opening in less than a millisecond) sodium channels to initiate depolarization are called fast response tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Fast response tissues include the atria, the specialized infranodal conducting system (bundle of His, fascicles and bundle branches, terminal Purkinje fibers), the ventricles, and atrioventricular bypass tracts.</p><p>The following is a simplified description of the steps involved in the generation of an action potential in the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71390\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71390 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61058\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61058 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The particular shape and duration of the individual action potential varies for atria, nodal tissue, specialized conduction tissue, and ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61989\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61989 \">figure 3</a>), depending upon differences in the density of ion channels in these tissues. The shape and duration of the action potentials also vary in right and left ventricle, and transmurally across the wall of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], again depending upon differences in ion channel and current densities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid depolarization (phase 0) occurs when the resting cell is brought to threshold, leading sequentially to activation or opening of voltage-dependent sodium channels, rapid sodium entry into the cells down a favorable concentration gradient, and a cell interior positive potential that can approach +45 mV. The marked depolarization initiates voltage-dependent inactivation of the sodium channels. Calcium channels also open during depolarization but the inward calcium flux is much slower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 1 repolarization often inscribes a &quot;notch&quot; and is primarily caused by activation of the transient outward potassium currents (Ito) combined with a corresponding rapid decay of the sodium current.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This is followed by a plateau in phase 2 in which continued &quot;late&quot; calcium and to a lesser extent &quot;late&quot; sodium current flowing into the cell balances the effect of potassium currents and maintains a stable membrane potential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decay of the calcium current and increases in delayed rectifier potassium currents initiate repolarization and the inward rectifier current dominates the terminal repolarization with return to the resting potential (phase 3).</p><p/><p>During one cycle of depolarization and repolarization, the voltage-dependent channels cycle through three different kinetic or gating states:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open, as the channels open during phase 0 depolarization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivated, which occurs at positive potentials (end of phase 0) and during sustained depolarization (as during the phase 2 plateau). During recovery in diastole, the channel returns to the resting state.</p><p/><p>The resting and inactivated states are different physiologically, even though the channel is effectively nonconducting in both settings. In the resting state, the channels can be opened positive to the threshold potential. In comparison, the inactivated channel cannot be activated until it cycles or &quot;recovers&quot; to the resting state. These different states are important clinically, since, for example, some antiarrhythmic drugs (such as the class I antiarrhythmic drugs) preferentially bind to open and inactivated sodium channels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Impulse propagation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an action potential forms in a patch of membrane (the source), current flows from this patch to neighboring patches (the sink). Gap junctions are the low resistance structures that allow ions to flow from one cell to another and, if the current flow is sufficient, to cause sequential depolarization from cell to cell. The gap junctions are actually active, opening and closing in response to changes in pH, calcium, and, at times, voltage. In addition to ion flow and gap junction resistance, impulse propagation can also be affected by the orientation of fibers and of the collagen matrix in which the fibers reside.</p><p>&quot;Fast&quot; tissues may conduct very slowly - declining from <span class=\"nowrap\">meters/sec</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">millimeters/sec</span> - in a number of circumstances, resulting in prolongation of the QRS and QT intervals on the surface ECG. These include inactivation of sodium channels induced by hyperkalemia or ischemia-induced acidosis, direct damage to the cells, or the effect of drugs, particularly antiarrhythmic drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Action potential in slow response tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes represent slow response tissues, which have different properties from the fast response tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71831\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71831 \">table 1</a>). Phase 0 depolarization depends on an inward calcium (not sodium) current via L-type calcium channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These channels are selective for calcium, have a slower conduction velocity than the sodium channels, and take longer to reactivate.</p><p>In some cases, as with tissue damage or changes in the extracellular milieu, fast response tissues can be converted to slow response tissues. In this setting, sodium channels become inactivated and depolarization is dependent upon the slow calcium channels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The different antiarrhythmic drugs often have several effects on action potential generation and propagation and may also affect the autonomic nervous system. Those drugs that act on ion channels may preferentially bind to the activated (open) or inactivated state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The classification of antiarrhythmic drugs according to the Harrison modification of the Vaughan-Williams classification was originally based upon their effects on the action potential and also assumes that individual drugs have a predominant mechanism of action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 2</a>). This distinction remains clinically useful even though it does not account for complicated electrophysiologic and autonomic interactions that may be present or for the action of certain antiarrhythmic drugs such as digitalis and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The modified Vaughan-Williams classification has proven surprisingly useful even though it represents an oversimplification of the electrophysiologic events that occur. The classification appears to work because the multiple factors that influence cardiac excitability are sufficiently coordinated to produce predictable outcomes, rather than unpredictably complex behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an electrophysiologic matrix or substrate of interacting active (ion channels) and passive (lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, myoplasm, and gap junctions) cellular properties that determine normal cardiac excitability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal substrate is altered by arrhythmogenic influences that affect one or more determinants of excitability. The ensuing proarrhythmic state can result in reentrant, automatic, or triggered arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-cardiac-automaticity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced cardiac automaticity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substrate that is deformed by arrhythmogenic factors interacts with antiarrhythmic drugs. Depending upon the substrate encountered, the resulting substrate may be antiarrhythmic, antifibrillatory, or proarrhythmic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain arrhythmogenic substrates are common, such as those induced by ischemia or infarction. In this setting, a certain effect of a drug becomes predominant and predictable, as with class I activity in ischemia, and a drug classification appears accurate. However, the major drug effect may be quite different if a different proarrhythmic substrate exists. Consider, for example, the differences in digitalis action in hypokalemia and hyperkalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Class I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The class I drugs act by modulating or blocking the sodium channels, thereby inhibiting phase 0 depolarization. They are all at least in part positively charged and presumably interact with specific amino acid residues in the internal pore of the sodium channel. Three different subgroups have been identified because their mechanism or duration of action is somewhat different due to variable rates of drug binding to and dissociation from the channel receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The class IC agents have the slowest binding and dissociation from the receptor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The class IB agents have the most rapid binding and dissociation from the receptor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The class IA agents are intermediate in terms of the speed of binding and dissociation from the receptor.</p><p/><p>During faster heart rates, less time exists for the drug to dissociate from the receptor, resulting in an increased number of blocked channels and enhanced blockade. These pharmacologic effects may cause a progressive decrease in impulse conduction velocity and a widening of the QRS complex. This property is known as &quot;use-dependence&quot; and is seen most frequently with the class IC agents, less frequently with the class IA drugs, and rarely with the class IB agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class IA drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>) depress phase 0 (sodium-dependent) depolarization, thereby slowing conduction. They also have moderate potassium channel blocking activity (which tends to slow the rate of repolarization and prolong action potential duration [APD]), anticholinergic activity, and tend to depress myocardial contractility. At slower heart rates, when use-dependent blockade of the sodium current is not significant, potassium channel blockade may become predominant (reverse use-dependence), leading to prolongation of the APD and QT interval and increased automaticity.<br/><br/>One difference between the drugs is that quinidine and procainamide generally decrease vascular resistance, whereas disopyramide increases vascular resistance. In addition, N-acetyl-procainamide (NAPA), a metabolite of procainamide, has little sodium current blocking activity, while retaining potassium current blocking activity. Thus, NAPA behaves like a class III drug. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Class III'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The class IB drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a>) have less prominent sodium channel blocking activity at rest, but effectively block the sodium channel in depolarized tissues. They tend to bind in the inactivated state (which is induced by depolarization) and dissociate from the sodium channel more rapidly than other class I drugs. As a result, they are more effective with tachyarrhythmias than with slow arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class IC drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>) primarily block open sodium channels and slow conduction. They dissociate slowly from the sodium channels during diastole, resulting in increased effect at more rapid rate (use-dependence). This characteristic is the basis for their antiarrhythmic efficacy, especially against supraventricular arrhythmias. Use-dependence may also contribute to the proarrhythmic activity of these drugs, especially in the diseased myocardium, resulting in incessant ventricular tachycardia.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> also have potassium channel blocking activity and can increase the APD in ventricular myocytes.

When enhanced, it lengthens the APD and can create a substrate for arrhythmia by reentry and triggered activity (both early and delayed afterdepolarizations).

Verapamil and diltiazem can slow the sinus rate (usually in the presence of the sick sinus syndrome or beta blockade), increase the refractoriness of and prolong conduction through the AV node, occasionally prolong the PR interval, and depress left ventricular function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1761920864\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiarrhythmic drugs target ion channels and receptors in the heart, generally blocking or inhibiting function.
