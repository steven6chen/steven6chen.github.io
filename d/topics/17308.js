Many people have this problem. In some people, it can last months or years. Tinnitus can be annoying, but it is not usually a sign of a serious problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537233287\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes tinnitus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinnitus is often caused by damage to cells in a part of the inner ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73491 \">figure 1</a>). When these cells are damaged, they send signals to the brain that make you think you are hearing things that are not really there.</p><p>The damage that leads to tinnitus can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal aging and hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loud noise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines, including some antibiotics, anti-seizure medicines, and painkillers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head or neck injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain diseases</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537233294\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tinnitus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with tinnitus hear a high-pitched, steady ringing. Some people with the condition hear pulsing, rushing, or humming sounds. These sounds sometimes get louder or softer during movement or exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537233301\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse about the ringing in my ears?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you hear ringing or other sounds that the people around you do not hear, see your doctor or nurse. He or she can run tests to make sure there is nothing seriously wrong with your ears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537233308\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a treatment for tinnitus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors cannot usually cure tinnitus. But they can often offer treatments and techniques that make it easier to live with. Possible treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hearing aids</strong> &ndash; People whose tinnitus is related to hearing loss often find that they are less bothered by their tinnitus if they get a hearing aid. Hearing aids make outside sounds clearer and louder, which helps make tinnitus less noticeable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tinnitus retraining therapy</strong> &ndash; During &quot;tinnitus retraining therapy,&quot; you work with a tinnitus expert to retrain your brain. You learn to view the ringing in your ears as normal background sounds rather than annoying distractions. Over time the sounds bother you less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sounds that cover up tinnitus</strong> &ndash; People can sometimes cover up or &quot;mask&quot; the ringing in their years by listening to music or other soft sounds. There is even a &quot;white noise&quot; device that makes a sound to mask tinnitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biofeedback</strong> &ndash; During biofeedback, you learn to breathe deeply when you hear the ringing and change your reaction to it in other ways. The technique helps you to relax and be less bothered by the sounds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy</strong> &ndash; During cognitive behavioral therapy, you talk with a psychologist or counselor. It teaches you ways to cope with tinnitus and ways to distract yourself. It also teaches you to see tinnitus in a new way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unproven treatments</strong> &ndash; Other treatments for tinnitus include electrical stimulation, acupuncture, and herbs. None of these treatments have been proven to work. But some people say they help. Always tell your doctor or nurse about any herbs you decide to try.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537233315\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had tinnitus for a long time, it probably is not going to go away. But it might bother you less over time.</p><p>Try not to let yourself become distressed by your condition. And if you do feel down, ask your doctor or nurse for advice.</p><p>If your tinnitus makes it hard to sleep, talk to your doctor or nurse about that too. Losing sleep can make life even harder to cope with. But there might be treatments or strategies for you to try.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537233322\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
