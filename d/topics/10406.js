Complete avoidance is typically prescribed for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies as well as food-protein enterocolitis in infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Successful allergen avoidance is straightforward in theory. However, in reality, avoidance requires extensive patient education. Clinicians should know how to instruct patients to read labels on packaged foods, prepare safe meals at home, and avoid food allergens in restaurant meals. Unintended exposure through cross-contact of foods in a variety of settings must be avoided. Food ingredients may be components of nonfood items, such as medications and vaccines. They may also be incorporated into substances that are inadvertently ingested, such as cosmetics and children's crafts. Lastly, exposure to allergen-containing saliva may occur during kissing or sharing of utensils. This topic review will present each of these issues individually.</p><p>The management of food allergy in daycare, schools, and camp settings is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in schools and camps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with food allergy are typically instructed to practice strict avoidance. However, most patients attempting to eliminate a certain food from the diet will not be entirely successful, despite best efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, patients must be prepared to treat an unexpected reaction at all times and in any setting. A validated food allergy educational curriculum that describes specific food allergy disorders and addresses issues related to food allergen avoidance and use of self-injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is available for free at the <a href=\"http://www.cofargroup.org/&amp;token=S0c051S8O64jWiohlB8+OtrFjaZYfSVqizpECSAybpAAnH20BaLnqu0CrfiOXTRU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2406\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Food Allergy Educational Program of the Consortium of Food Allergy Research</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">How strict must avoidance be?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict avoidance is recommended for most patients with food allergy. However, thresholds of clinical reactivity vary dramatically among allergic individuals and can also vary depending upon how the food is processed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergens-overview-of-clinical-features-and-cross-reactivity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergens: Overview of clinical features and cross-reactivity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-features-of-food-allergens\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular features of food allergens&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Important observations about avoidance include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies indicate that less than a milligram of milk, egg, or peanut can induce symptoms in some highly sensitive individuals, while others may not experience a reaction until more than 10 grams have been ingested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical experience and observational studies show that some individuals with egg or milk allergy tolerate these foods in low amounts and as minor ingredients baked into products, such as cakes or cookies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milk-allergy-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Milk allergy: Management&quot;, section on 'Dietary recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=egg-allergy-management#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Egg allergy: Management&quot;, section on 'Dietary recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain types of mild allergy may not require strict avoidance, such as the pollen-food related syndrome or oral allergy syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H87926440\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Avoidance'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Thus, clinician experience and discretion is needed to tailor avoidance recommendations to the patient's specific situation and degree of sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin contact and inhalation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food-allergic reactions generally occur following ingestion. Other routes of exposure, such as skin exposure or inhalation, are unlikely to cause significant reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Even in the most highly sensitive individuals, these types of exposure appear to cause very limited reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The most likely explanation for reactions that appear to occur in the absence of ingestion is inadvertent contact with the food and subsequent transfer of allergen from the hands to the mouth or other mucosal tissues.</p><p>A small number of studies directly investigated the effects of noningestion exposures, with reassuring results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study applied a gram of peanut butter for 15 minutes to the skin of 281 children who were skin prick-test positive to peanut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The challenge was considered positive if one or more wheals (urticaria) were present when the peanut butter was removed, and 41 percent of tests were positive. No child experienced a systemic reaction. A subset of children with either positive or negative contact tests then underwent blinded, placebo-controlled, oral challenges. In the contact-positive group, 82 percent of children reacted to ingesting peanut, while, in the contact-negative group, 50 percent reacted. Thus, contact urticaria to peanut is not uncommon among peanut-allergic children and may be more likely in highly reactive children. However, no systemic reactions occurred during the 15-minute skin exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 children with histories of severe reactions to peanut ingestion were challenged by close <span class=\"nowrap\">proximity/smelling</span> peanut butter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A six-inch square area of peanut butter hidden with sheer gauze was placed 12 inches from the children's faces for 10 minutes. No child experienced symptoms from <span class=\"nowrap\">proximity/smelling</span> of peanut butter, although one experienced throat symptoms during exposure to placebo (presumably from anxiety).</p><p/><p>There is a distinction between smelling a food and inhaling an aerosolized food. Simply smelling a noncooking food can result from contact between the nasal mucosa and airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) given off continuously by foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast, inhalation of aerosolized food implies actual contact between food matter and the respiratory mucosa (nasal or pulmonary). Aerosolization of food can occur as a result of cooking or processing (eg, boiling, frying, grating, shredding, grinding). Nonetheless, regarding peanut, several studies have failed to detect peanut in the air near peanut butter or when peanuts are being shelled or manipulated in other ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>During aerosolization, actual food matter, including proteins, may become airborne. This is critical because all identified food allergens are proteins, and these proteins are the necessary inciting agents of allergic reactions. Inhalation contact with aerosolized food has been shown to be capable of inducing asthmatic or respiratory reactions in highly sensitive individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>]. To avoid respiratory reactions, highly sensitive individuals should avoid situations in which aerosolized food could be inhaled, including proximity to steam and vapors from cooking, or proximity to an activity involving chopping, grinding, or vigorously manipulating the culprit food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22789097\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal dietary avoidance of allergens for infants with proven food allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food allergens ingested by the mother can be detected in breast milk, with individual variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. A study in which 23 women ingested 50 g of dry-roasted peanut found that peanut protein was detectable in 11 (48 percent) participants, with a median peak protein concentration of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There are case reports and case series indicating that allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur in the infant from transfer of maternally ingested allergen through breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>]. There is also evidence that infants may have chronic atopic dermatitis or gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, proctocolitis) triggered by food allergens in breast milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/20,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25,26</a>]. Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome triggered by allergen in breast milk is also possible, although rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When a breastfed infant is diagnosed with an allergy to a specific food, the infant must avoid direct ingestion of the allergen. Options regarding the maternal diet include strict avoidance, reduced ingestion, no avoidance, or, for milk and egg, ingestion of only extensively heated forms (eg, bakery goods) that appear to have reduced allergenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. An alternative option is the cessation of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There are no controlled trials upon which to base recommendations about maternal avoidance, and strict avoidance could be recommended in all circumstances.</p><p>Maternal dietary allergen avoidance while breastfeeding an infant with food allergy has been suggested if symptoms are attributable to the mother's diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, arguments against strict maternal avoidance, if there are no apparent ill effects on the infant during maternal consumption, include improved <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/infant</span> nutrition and quality of life. Additionally, there is a lack of data on whether allergens in breast milk are tolerizing or sensitizing for the infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-allergic-disease-maternal-diet-in-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of allergic disease: Maternal diet in pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We generally recommend strict maternal dietary avoidance if the infant had an acute reaction to an allergen in breast milk, a severe anaphylactic reaction to an allergen the infant ingested directly, chronic symptoms attributable to the food despite a low maternal intake of the trigger, or a reaction to a food that often triggers severe reactions and is generally eaten by the mother in larger quantities during meals (eg, peanut, nuts, fish, shellfish).</p><p>We discuss the option of allowing reduced maternal intake of the allergen (at or below amounts ingested prior to diagnosis or, for milk or egg, using baked forms) when the breastfed infant had no history of chronic symptoms prior to the diagnosis of food allergy or when maternal dietary allergen reduction resolves mild chronic symptoms. In one study of infants with cow's milk allergy, the median dose of milk ingested by the mother that elicited symptoms, primarily flaring of eczema, in the breastfed infant was 700 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>When mothers follow avoidance diets, nutritional issues should be addressed.

Consultation with a registered dietitian can be helpful in developing a plan for food allergen avoidance and preventing dietary deficiencies, especially in children with multiple food allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Food labeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laws regarding what a manufacturer is required to present on an ingredient statement of a prepared food vary by country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

These allergens must be listed if they are present as an ingredient in any amount. The plain English words used to identify the foods may be placed within the ingredient list or as a separate &quot;contains&quot; statement. The law also requires that the specific type of allergen within a category be named, such as hazelnut or walnut, in addition to &quot;tree nuts.&quot;</p><p>FALCPA applies to foods manufactured in the United States, as well as packaged foods that are imported for sale and subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation. FALCPA applies to all types of packaged foods except for meat, egg, and poultry products and raw agricultural foods, such as fruits and vegetables in their natural state.</p><p>Previously, foods could be labeled only with scientific or nonspecific terms (eg, casein or &quot;natural flavor&quot; for milk).

The law still allows the use of such terms, although plain English must also be present. FALCPA <strong>only</strong> applies to the eight major allergens listed here. Other allergens, such as garlic or sesame, may still be listed using ambiguous terms, such as &quot;spice.&quot; In some cases where ambiguous terms remain, a consumer may need to call the manufacturer to clarify ingredients. In regards to soy, terms such as soybean, soy, and soya are considered interchangeable. For seafood, FALCPA requires the identification of finned fish and crustacean shellfish (eg, lobster, shrimp, crab), although noncrustaceans, such as squid or mollusks (eg, clams, mussels, oysters), do not have to be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seafood-allergies-fish-and-shellfish\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seafood allergies: Fish and shellfish&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The FALCPA legislation does not define a safe threshold of included allergens, and several food ingredients may now be included on labels that did not previously disclose them. Processing aids, such as soy lecithin, a fatty derivative of soy that contains a very small amount of soy protein, may now appear as &quot;soy&quot; (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Medications and asthma inhalers'</a> below). The law acknowledges that certain forms of highly processed oils may not contain any appreciable protein, for example, soy oil. FALCPA is likely to be revised by allowed petition. Updates are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, a branch of the FDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Legislation in other countries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other countries are addressing issues of food labeling as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The European Union includes all of the US foods and adds sesame, mollusks, mustard, celery, and lupine; Australia includes the US foods and adds gluten and sesame; Japan requires labeling specifically for milk, egg, shrimp, crab, peanut, wheat, and buckwheat but &quot;recommends&quot; declaring 18 additional foods, among them salmon, walnut, soy, and gelatin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Advisory labeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain phrases are used by the food industry when a particular allergen is not an intended ingredient of the food but rather may contact or become a part of the food despite accepted manufacturing processes. Various terms are used, including &quot;may contain,&quot; &quot;processed in a facility with,&quot; &quot;manufactured on shared equipment with,&quot; and others. These terms are applied at the discretion of the manufacturer. Such labeling is common. An extensive audit of 20,241 supermarket products found that 17 percent had advisory labeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Advisory labeling can be both beneficial and detrimental to food-allergic individuals. The risk of allergen exposure is likely reduced, although, if the terms are applied too broadly to food products that pose little risk, allergic consumers may choose to ignore the warnings in order to expand their dietary options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. We advise patients to avoid foods that include the culprit allergen in an advisory statement because it is impossible for the consumer to determine the actual risk, and serious reactions from cross-contact have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>A study of over 600 consumers who shop for persons with food allergies showed that significantly fewer were avoiding products with advisory labels in 2006 than in 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Shoppers judged risk based upon label terminology. As an example, they were more likely to purchase products labeled &quot;made in a facility that processes peanut&quot; than those labeled &quot;may contain peanut&quot; when shopping for a peanut-allergic patient. However, assays of a sample of 179 products with advisory labeling for peanut disclosed that 7 percent of the products contained detectable peanut protein regardless of how the warning was stated. Thus, consumers are increasingly taking risks and falsely assuming that the label terminology reflects the risk level.</p><p>Another study examined products with milk-advisory labeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Detectable milk was found in 34 of 81 (42 percent) of these products, a much higher frequency than similar studies of peanut. The study included 18 dark chocolate products, 78 percent of which had detectable milk protein. Estimates of the doses of milk that might be ingested in a normal serving size of these milk-contaminated products ranged from 0.027 to 620 mg of milk.</p><p>In a study of a selection of 401 products from among types having a higher rate of advisory labeling (baking and pancake mixes, chocolate and nonchocolate candies, cookies, salty snacks, cold cereals, and pastas), 3 of 26 products labeled as using &quot;Good Manufacturing Practices&quot; had detectable levels of unintended allergens (all from one supermarket chain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Overall, contamination with an allergenic food (milk, egg, or peanut) was seen in 5.3 percent of products with advisory statements and in 1.9 percent of similar products without this labeling. Contaminated products were more commonly from small (5.1 percent) rather than large (0.75 percent) companies.</p><p>Certain groups of food-allergic individuals are less likely to heed advisory labeling, specifically teenagers and young adults.

Utensils, cookware, glassware, storage containers, and other food preparation materials in contact with an allergen should not be used to prepare or serve &quot;safe&quot; meals, unless thoroughly cleaned first. Alternatively, the safe meal can be prepared first as a matter of routine before other food. Additional tips include keeping food containers covered to prevent spill contamination and designating specific containers of food for use by the allergic person only.</p><p>Vigilance for cross-contact must be practiced by everyone in the family, including other small children. For example, a knife used to prepare peanut butter and jelly by a nonallergic child could introduce peanut allergen into otherwise safe jelly and subsequently cause a reaction in a peanut-allergic sibling eating the jelly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although only investigated for peanut butter, cleaning tabletops with several standard cleansers was sufficient for removal of peanut allergen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Household cleaners (with the exception of dishwashing liquid) and commercial wipes effectively removed peanut allergen from table tops. Both liquid or bar soap, but not alcohol-based antibacterial gels, removed peanut allergen from adults' hands. This study is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-schools-and-camps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in schools and camps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Restaurant meals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study of persons with peanut and tree nut allergies revealed that certain restaurants or food services were high risk: ice cream parlors, bakeries, and Asian restaurants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These types of restaurants frequently use <span class=\"nowrap\">peanut/nut</span> ingredients and are prone to cross-contact. Similarly, persons with a seafood allergy would likely have more difficulty obtaining a safe meal from a restaurant that specializes in seafood. Buffet services should be avoided due to the risk of cross-contact. Additional problems identified are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76289 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>One study administered telephone questionnaires to 100 individuals (including managers, servers, chefs, and other personnel) employed in various restaurants and food establishments in the New York City area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Five true or false questions about food allergy were presented, and only 22 percent of respondents answered all five correctly. Despite this, approximately 50 percent of respondents felt &quot;very comfortable&quot; that they could provide a safe meal to a food-allergic customer. A British study found a similar disconnect between restaurant staff knowledge and comfort level in providing safe meals to those with food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients should not assume that restaurant personnel understand food allergy or know what steps must be taken to guarantee that a meal is safe.</p><p>Consumers should identify that they have an allergy (not just distaste for the food) to those who are directly responsible for preparing the meal (ie, the cook, rather than the waitstaff). We suggest discussing hidden ingredients and cross-contact with the restaurant staff to ensure that they do not have misconception, as noted in the study mentioned above. It is helpful to carry a supply of pre-printed cards with clear information about which foods cannot be eaten and a reminder that cooking containers and serving utensils cannot be contaminated with the allergenic food. As an example, it may be necessary to prepare food in cleaned pans and glassware rather than to use shared grills or blenders. Deep fryers, in which oil is reused for frying different foods, should be avoided as the oil easily becomes contaminated with protein from previously cooked foods. Ingredient lists on menus should not be trusted at face value, and the absence of allergens should be verified for any dish ordered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Airline travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions to peanut and tree nuts have been reported on commercial airliners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. Studies of these events have relied upon self-reported reactions to ingestion, skin contact, and inhalation. The degree of risk is difficult to ascertain from these studies. However, travelers with food allergies should avoid eating potentially unsafe airline foods. Those traveling with young children may wish to clean tray tables and inspect seating areas for residual foods that might be ingested by toddlers. Some airlines may provide additional accommodations when requested in advance (eg, a flight where peanuts are not served).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOD ALLERGENS IN NONFOOD ITEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumers with food allergy should be instructed that nonfood items may contain food ingredients, such as medications, vaccines, cosmetics, and craft supplies. Labeling laws do not apply to these products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumers and clinicians should be aware that vaccines can contain food allergens, including egg, chicken, cow's milk, and gelatin proteins. The evaluation and management of allergic reactions to vaccines are presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-reactions-to-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic reactions to vaccines&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-vaccination-in-individuals-with-egg-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Influenza vaccination in individuals with egg allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications and asthma inhalers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over-the-counter and prescription medications in tablet and capsule form, some inhaled medications for asthma, and some brands of injectable glucocorticoids can also contain food allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Several examples are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Lactose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactose is a milk sugar derived from milk that is used in many dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), some brands of oral and injectable glucocorticoids, and a few oral medications that are commonly used in atopic patients. Pharmaceutical-grade lactose is considered to contain very little to no milk protein, on the order of a few parts per million. However, possible reactions in children with severe milk allergy have been reported, and small amounts of milk proteins have been detected in various DPI devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (Solu-Medrol 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. We prefer lactose-free preparations or metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) (which use liquid medications and propellants) for patients with asthma and milk allergy. We also avoid, when practical, other lactose-containing medications (eg, the soluble tablet formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a>, chewable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, and the 10 mg formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>) in highly milk-allergic patients for the same reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Soy lecithin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain inhalers contain soy lecithin, which is the fatty derivative of soy. Soy lecithin contains a trace amount of detectable soy protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The product insert on some of these medications indicates a contraindication for the use of products with soy lecithin if there is an allergy to soybean or peanut. However, the degree of risk for use of soy lecithin-containing medications in persons with peanut or soy allergy has not been systematically evaluated. Considering the small amount of protein present, the risk of a reaction from these medications seems very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In addition, over 90 percent of peanut-allergic individuals tolerate soy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Thus, although the use of these medications in highly sensitive soy or peanut-allergic patients is generally avoided, there may be situations in which exceptions are appropriate, following a discussion of risks and benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Casein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Casein, a cow's milk protein, has been used as an anti-stick agent on latex gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Egg lysozyme</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lysozyme, an enzyme found in egg white, is used in pharmaceutical products.

Kissing, in particular passionate kissing, is a relatively common route of exposure. Of 379 allergy patients in the United States with peanut, tree nut, legume, or seed allergy, over 5 percent reported reactions from kissing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Of 839 food allergy patients in Denmark, 16 percent reported reactions after kissing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>A study was undertaken to determine the time course of peanut protein (a marker protein Ara h 1) in saliva after a meal of peanut butter and possible methods for reducing levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Detection of Ara h 1 in saliva was performed by a monoclonal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; detection limit, 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. Most (87 percent) subjects with detectable peanut after a meal had undetectable levels by one hour with no interventions. None had detectable levels several hours later following a subsequent peanut-free lunch.</p><p>In the same study, various immediate interventions following a peanut butter meal were assessed, including immediate brushing, prolonged rinsing, both, waiting an hour then brushing, or waiting 30 minutes then chewing gum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. None of these interventions consistently resulted in undetectable levels, although levels were lower than might usually be expected to trigger a reaction (below 17 micrograms of peanut protein in 5 mL of saliva). The immediate interventions led to undetectable levels in only one in five subjects. However, methods which included a waiting period reduced salivary allergen to undetectable levels in 8 of 10 (wait-brush) and 8 of 9 (wait-gum) subjects. The studies were performed with peanut butter, and results may vary with other allergens or forms of peanut. There is one case report of a mild reaction to peanut despite a two-hour wait, brushing teeth, and chewing gum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-food-allergy-avoidance/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>In summary, allergen exposure through contact with saliva from another person who has recently ingested the food is possible.
