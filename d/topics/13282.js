While these conditions are often concurrent, one may be mild or asymptomatic.

SUI may also worsen after prolapse repair.</p><p>Deciding whether to perform a combined surgical procedure to treat both prolapse and SUI or a single procedure that addresses only one condition requires balancing the risk of incomplete treatment with the risk of exposing the patient to unnecessary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The rate of concurrent prolapse repair and continence procedures appears to be increasing. Data from the United States National Inpatient sample showed that for apical prolapse repair procedures, the rate of concurrent continence surgery increased from 38 percent in 2001 to 47 percent in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Challenges in surgical decision-making in this clinical context include appropriate assessment of results of preoperative evaluation, some of which may be ambiguous (eg, prolapse noted on examination in a patient with no prolapse-related symptoms or a patient with advance prolapse with no leakage on prolapse reduction testing).</p><p>Combined surgical treatment for POP and SUI will be reviewed here.

On the other hand, POP symptoms may be nonspecific (pelvic pressure or discomfort) and some women only recognize these as related to POP after evaluation by a clinician. The symptoms of prolapse and incontinence may be equally bothersome or one condition may predominate.

This phenomenon is known as occult SUI. Testing for occult SUI is discussed below (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Detecting occult incontinence'</a> below). </p><p>Anatomically, this occurs because in women with significant anterior or apical prolapse (usually prolapse past the vaginal introitus), the bladder neck is displaced posteriorly and the urethra is kinked, resulting in urethral obstruction. The obstruction then becomes the mechanism of continence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85778\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85778 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>When the prolapsed structures are elevated (approximating normal anatomy) during prolapse reduction testing in women with urethral obstruction due to advanced POP, the urethra is unblocked and SUI often becomes evident when a urinary stress test is performed. On the other hand, women with stage I POP are unlikely to have urethral obstruction and resultant occult SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Detecting occult incontinence'</a> below.) </p><p>Occult SUI is diagnosed using preoperative prolapse reduction testing in 31 to 80 percent of women with symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advanced POP who are planning surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/13-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-26</a>]. Accordingly, when women with occult SUI undergo prolapse repair without a concomitant continence procedure, the rate of postoperative de novo SUI ranges in studies from 13 to 72 percent (mean 54 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66014 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>However, women who have negative preoperative testing for occult SUI and undergo prolapse repair without a continence procedure may still develop SUI after surgery, but at a lower rate than women who test positive for occult SUI with preoperative prolapse reduction testing. The rate of postoperative incontinence in women with negative preoperative occult stress testing ranges in studies from 0 to 42 percent (mean 26 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66014 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/14-16,18,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,18,27-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incontinence with no symptoms of prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who present with SUI will often have POP of varying degrees.

The purpose is to simulate the patient's vaginal architecture after surgical repair. Reducing the prolapse will often reduce a previously elevated postvoid residual and unmask SUI.</p><p>Prolapse reduction should be performed while the patient is standing. While elevating the prolapsed structures, it is important to avoid obstructing the urethra, which would mask incontinence. One should also avoid placing the anterior vaginal wall under excessive tension, which could distort the pelvic anatomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;, section on 'Pelvic examination'</a>.)</p><p>The most common methods of prolapse reduction use the following to elevate the structures: examiner's fingers, large cotton swab, single speculum blade, ring forceps, or pessary. While there are few data comparing these methods, using a pessary may be less effective at detecting SUI than other methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/16,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,33</a>]. This is likely because incontinence pessaries increase the maximum urethral closure pressure and functional urethral length and, thus, are often used to treat SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Some data suggest that the bladder should be filled to at least 300 mL; in one study, occult SUI identified with use of a bladder volume of 300 mL was more likely than 100 mL to be associated with postoperative SUI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>In the largest study to evaluate prolapse reduction testing, data regarding prolapse reduction using five methods (manual, swab, speculum, forceps, pessary) were collected in women with advanced prolapse, but without symptoms of SUI (n = 322) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The sensitivity for detection of occult SUI was similar among most reduction testing methods (17 to 39 percent), with the exception of the pessary, which was less sensitive (5 percent). In our practice, we use one or two large cotton swabs because it is well tolerated by patients and the swabs are long enough to approximate a surgical suspension of the vaginal apex.</p><p>Prolapse reduction testing may be performed as part of office testing of SUI or during urodynamic evaluation. Both approaches appear to have a similar predictive value for the development of postoperative SUI. This is based upon data from two prospective studies of women who underwent preoperative prolapse reduction testing and were treated with a prolapse repair procedure, but no continence procedure. Urodynamic evaluation was used in one study, and the rate of postoperative de novo SUI was 58 percent for women who tested positive for preoperative occult SUI and 38 percent for those who tested negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the other study, office testing was used, and the rate of de novo SUI was 72 percent for women who tested positive and 38 percent for women who tested negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Most studies define occult SUI as leakage with prolapse reduction during office testing or urodynamic evaluation, but some reports used maximum urethral closure pressures or pressure transmission ratios of &lt;0.9 or 1.0 during urodynamic evaluation to indicate a positive test. During urodynamic testing, prolapse reduction decreases maximal urethral closure pressure, but does not alter any other filling or pressure flow parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urodynamic-evaluation-of-women-with-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urodynamic evaluation of women with incontinence&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The predictive value of prolapse reduction testing is limited. The results of numerous studies evaluating the risk of postoperative SUI in women undergoing prolapse surgery with various clinical scenarios are summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66014 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/14-16,18,20,21,27-29,36-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16,18,20,21,27-29,36-50</a>].

In asymptomatic women who have <strong>negative</strong> prolapse reduction testing, the rate of postoperative SUI is 26 percent without an incontinence procedure and 17 percent with an incontinence procedure. </p><p>In the absence of more effective methods to detect occult SUI, however, reduction testing should be performed in all women planning vaginal pelvic floor reconstructive surgery.

An abdominal approach typically includes a sacrocolpopexy and Burch colposuspension, while a vaginal approach may include a uterosacral ligament fixation (or other transvaginal procedure) and suburethral sling (typically a midurethral sling). </p><p>Additional factors to consider in choosing a route are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical history &ndash; comorbidities, prior surgeries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedure efficacy &ndash; this depends upon procedure and surgeon's experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient preference</p><p/><p>Most combined procedures are performed vaginally for several reasons. Midurethral sling placement, a vaginal approach, is the preferred procedure for most women with SUI. Also, repair of anterior and posterior prolapse are usually performed vaginally.

Apical prolapse can also be repaired via a vaginal route, with sacrospinous or uterosacral ligament suspension. The choice of route for women with apical prolapse then depends upon the best combination of procedures: (1) midurethral sling and sacrospinous or uterosacral ligament suspension or (2) Burch colposuspension and abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Evidence from randomized trials has demonstrated that abdominal repairs are more durable, while vaginal repairs have fewer complications, including foreign body complications.

Historically, the only example of a POP repair procedure that was performed with the intention of treating SUI was anterior colporrhaphy alone or with a Kelly-Kennedy plication. This approach has been found to be less effective for treatment of SUI than a Burch colposuspension based upon randomized trial data. Likewise, available continence procedures (suburethral slings, Burch colposuspension) are not effective for treating symptoms associated with POP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, the addition of a prophylactic midurethral sling increases the risk of complications. Complications such as bladder perforation or UTI typically do not add significantly to postoperative morbidity, and resolve either with intraoperative treatment or short-term use of a bladder catheter or antibiotic therapy. However, some women will have persistent voiding dysfunction following midurethral sling surgery, requiring prolonged catheterization and potentially a subsequent surgical procedure. The rate of urethrolysis in the OPUS trial (2.4 percent) was consistent with the rate of post-sling persistent voiding dysfunction reported in other studies (0.6 to 2.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. This is an important consideration, since one of the principal benefits of prophylactic continence surgery is avoiding the need for a subsequent surgery.

Women with a positive preoperative prolapse reduction stress test are at the highest risk of postoperative SUI. In the OPUS trial, there was modest evidence to suggest that patients with a positive prolapse reduction stress test before surgery received more benefit than those with a negative test. The overall positive predictive value of the preoperative prolapse reduction stress for postoperative SUI based upon multiple studies is 51 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66014\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66014 \">algorithm 1</a>) and it was 72 percent in the OPUS trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/13-16,36,49,60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16,36,49,60-62</a>].

Management of these women depends upon their values and preferences. </p><p>Concomitant continence surgery in the OPUS trial in this patient population resulted in an absolute risk reduction for postoperative urinary incontinence of 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This rate was clinically significant, but must be considered in relation to the risk of sling-related complications and associated morbidity.</p><p>If a staged approach is used, a patient with stage II or greater POP without symptoms of SUI would only undergo surgery for POP with no concomitant continence procedure. The staged procedure typically takes place within one year of the original prolapse repair and it is performed only if the patient develops symptoms of bothersome SUI requiring correction. The advantage of this approach is that unnecessary procedures would be avoided. The OPUS trial demonstrated that, for women who underwent only vaginal POP repair, 49 percent developed SUI, but only 5 percent had a sling procedure in the first year. Compared with a universal approach, the staged approach resulted in a 95 percent reduction in the number of slings placed. </p><p>Given the available data and clinical considerations, for women with stage II or greater POP who are undergoing <strong>vaginal surgery</strong> and who have <strong>NEGATIVE</strong> preoperative testing for occult SUI, we suggest prolapse repair alone rather than a combined procedure for prolapse and SUI. Concomitant POP repair and continence surgery is a reasonable option for women who place a high priority on avoiding postoperative urinary incontinence and are willing to accept an increased risk of perioperative complications and voiding dysfunction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H502447\"><span class=\"h4\">Concomitant versus staged procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some experts have questioned whether the SUI cure rate is impacted depending upon whether the continence surgery is performed alone or concomitant with a POP repair procedure, but there appears to be no difference based upon available data. </p><p>This issue was evaluated in a multicenter randomized trial of women with POP and SUI who were assigned to have a tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) either concomitant with prolapse repair or a staged procedure (prolapse repair followed by TVT three months later) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In an intent-to-treat analysis, at one-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between the concomitant compared with staged groups in SUI cure rate (95 versus 89 percent) or total operative complications (18 versus 13 percent). Of note, in the staged group, TVT was ultimately performed only in women who had confirmed SUI at three months after prolapse repair (56 percent). Among the women in the staged group who did not undergo TVT, one-year outcomes were as follows: 27 percent were still continent and 15 percent had some SUI, but declined TVT. </p><p>In observational data from another trial, in which women were randomized to undergo either a retropubic or transobturator midurethral sling, those who did versus did not have concomitant surgery had significantly higher objective cure rates (88 versus 79 percent), but not subjective cure rates (62 versus 58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

In a prospective cohort study, women who underwent prolapse repair concomitantly with midurethral sling placement, compared with those who planned a staged procedure, had no significant differences in SUI symptoms (22 versus 21 percent), change in severity of SUI, or satisfaction (8.8 verus 9.2 on a 10 point scale) at one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

At 3 and 12 months postoperatively, the rates of postoperative SUI were higher in the women who did not receive a TVT. However, less than 10 percent of the women from the OPUS trial or a subsequent smaller trial who did not initially receive a TVT elected to have a staged TVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/13,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,62</a>]. Based on the low number of anti-incontinence procedures required to correct symptomatic SUI following prolapse repair, we counsel women that a staged approach is a reasonable option for those who wish to avoid the additional surgical risks of incontinence surgery (eg, bladder perforation, urinary tract infection, major bleeding, and urinary retention).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">SUI with asymptomatic POP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolapse, particularly stages I or II, is often asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Thus, women who present with symptoms of SUI only, but have POP on examination, present a treatment dilemma. The issue is whether repair of asymptomatic prolapse provides a woman with a long-term benefit (eg, prevention of subsequent symptoms or surgery) or if it only increases the risk of perioperative complications.</p><p>An important question is whether prolapse in these women will worsen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> become symptomatic with age or after menopause. Surprisingly, the natural history of prolapse does not follow a progressive course in all women. Data suggest that the course is progressive until menopause, after which the degree of prolapse may follow a course of alternating progression and regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. </p><p>Women with ongoing risk factors for POP are likely to have progression.

However, women who had a combined SUI and POP repair were also significantly more likely to have postoperative urethral obstruction (9 versus 6 percent). This study was limited by the lack of data on the stage of prolapse and whether symptoms were present, thus making it uncertain whether the results apply to asymptomatic women.</p><p>Additional surgical procedures increase operative time and may increase the risk of perioperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-and-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-combined-surgical-treatment/abstract/3,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,72</a>].

Since prolapse has not been proven to be progressive and stage I prolapse is almost never symptomatic, repair in these women appears to be unnecessary. Treatment of women with stage II or greater prolapse who are asymptomatic must be individualized based upon a discussion with the patient about her treatment goals and the risk of subsequent surgery.
