The disease typically begins in infancy and is marked by relentless progression.</p><p>Canavan disease was first described in the early 20th century as spongy degeneration of central nervous system myelin in infancy. The discovery of N-acetylaspartic aciduria due to aspartoacylase deficiency in a leukodystrophy was made in 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The realization that this leukodystrophy was actually Canavan disease with abnormal N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) metabolism was not made until 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Elevated urinary NAA excretion and aspartoacylase deficiency had been reported two years previously, but without a direct association to spongy degeneration of myelin in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The aspartoacylase gene was cloned in 1993, and numerous mutations have been identified since then [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Although the Canavan disease eponym is widely used, aspartoacylase deficiency is preferable. Of interest, Canavan's own report was linked to Schilder disease or Krabbe disease (galactocerebrosidase deficiency) and not spongy degeneration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the <em>ASPA</em> gene that encodes the enzyme aspartoacylase. The resulting deficiency of aspartoacylase leads to accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and to oligodendrocyte dysfunction, spongiform changes, and absence of myelin. However, the precise mechanisms causing spongiform degeneration are uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. The gene encoding aspartoacylase (ASPA) is located on chromosome 17pter-p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Several mutations have been defined in ASPA, but just four of them account for &gt;99 percent of aspartoacylase deficiency cases in Ashkenazi Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/3,5,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,7-10</a>].</p><p>In non-Ashkenazi individuals, a broad range of distinctly different mutations, including large deletions, has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>]. Unique ASPA mutations have been identified in the Japanese and Scandinavian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>N-acetylaspartic acid, formed from acetyl-CoA and aspartic acid, is the second most prevalent free amino acid in the brain. It is localized to neurons, where it is synthesized within mitochondria and transferred to oligodendrocytes via axo-glial contact zones between the innermost oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and the axonal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In neurons, NAA is converted to N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and is taken up by astrocytes, where it is hydrolyzed to NAA and glutamate. The NAA is then taken up by oligodendrocytes, the primary location of aspartoacylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Aspartoacylase catalyzes the conversion of NAA to aspartate (aspartic acid) and acetate. By mechanisms that are largely unknown, deficiency of aspartoacylase leads to oligodendrocyte dysfunction, the prominent spongiform changes, and absence of myelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Levels of NAA are markedly increased in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Loss-of-function mutations of the ASPA gene lead to structural changes, including decreased thermal or conformational stability, which result in diminished or nearly absent enzymatic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal myelination, with associated prominence of swollen, vacuolated astrocytes, is a fundamental hallmark of aspartoacylase deficiency. However, the specific role of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the pathogenesis of this disease is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One suggestion is that a reduction in aspartic acid as a result of aspartoacylase deficiency adversely impacts the recycling of aspartate for NAA synthesis and the availability of aspartate for intercellular signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another plausible hypothesis is that of a cytotoxic mechanism involving NAA or its metabolic product, N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It has been proposed that the extracellular concentration of NAA increases up to 1000-fold secondary to absent or markedly decreased aspartoacylase activity, resulting in disruption of the oligodendrocyte-axon interface and interruption of myelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. However, NAA concentration in the brain of patients with aspartoacylase deficiency is less than twofold elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In an animal model, deficient aspartoacylase expression resulted in altered oligodendrocyte maturation, markedly reduced myelination, and increased levels of GFAP protein, a marker of gliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, NAA is taken up by astrocytes, producing the prominent vacuolization within their cytoplasm, and leading to macrocephaly. In this model, NAA is cytotoxic for astrocytes and not oligodendrocytes. The turnover of NAA is regarded as highly dynamic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. As such, failure of NAA degradation could provide a profound osmotic force, resulting in the observed vacuolar changes in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The disruption of mitochondria in astrocytes may be a secondary phenomenon, but a primary alteration in mitochondrial metabolism has been proposed as potentially related to the prominent cellular alterations. N-acetylaspartate synthase deficiency corrected the myelin and neuronal phenotype in a mouse model of Canavan disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. These findings strongly support the notion that elevation of NAA is the major disease mechanism, and suggests a therapeutic approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A further potential pathogenetic mechanism involves NAAG as a trigger of glutamate excitotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The possibility of an acetate deficit secondary to low or absent aspartoacylase activity (NAA is hydrolyzed to acetate and L-aspartate) also has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. This seems less likely, as alternate acetate sources are readily available via other metabolic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Finally, oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of aspartoacylase deficiency, based upon evidence that NAA produces lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and reduces antioxidants in rat brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. NAA-derived acetyl groups may be a means by which oligodendrocytes preserve energetic resources during myelination by uncoupling fatty acid synthesis from oxidative metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Further support for this hypothesis was found in the salutary effect of anaplerotic therapy in a Canavan disease mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency is highly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. It has been described in other populations as well, including a large series from Saudi Arabia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The carrier frequency among the Ashkenazi ranges from 1:37 to 1:57, yielding a range of approximate prevalence rates between 1:6000 and 1:14,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The disorder is much less common in non-Ashkenazi populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. However, sufficient data are not available to calculate a prevalence rate in groups other than Jewish people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial presentation of aspartoacylase deficiency, generally at about age three months, features lethargy and listlessness, weak cry and suck, poor head control, and hypotonia with a paucity of extremity movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, poor feeding, irritability, and visual inattention have been described in neonates.</p><p>Macrocephaly becomes prominent by three to six months, and thereafter hypotonia progresses to spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and tonic extensor spasms. The extensor spasms may occur in response to noise, but infants with aspartoacylase deficiency do not exhibit the hyperacusis noted in Tay-Sachs disease.</p><p>By age six months, neurologic abnormalities are invariant in those with the typical form of aspartoacylase deficiency. Little subsequent development is noted, although visual fixation may be acquired later only to be lost.</p><p>Blindness in association with optic atrophy occurs between 6 and 18 months. Seizures, usually generalized tonic-clonic, are noted in about 50 percent. Unlike most leukodystrophies, the cerebrospinal fluid protein is usually normal. Fair complexion has been described, but this is of dubious significance.</p><p>Pseudobulbar signs and decerebrate posturing dominate the end stage of aspartoacylase deficiency. Feeding is a major issue with prominent swallowing dysfunction and gastroesophageal reflux. Death may occur in childhood, although survival into the teens is typical as the result of enhanced medical management, particularly alternative feeding strategies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of variant forms of aspartoacylase deficiency is controversial. A suggested juvenile-onset form, beginning after age five, is characterized by spasticity, cerebellar dysfunction, and blindness, with death occurring by the age of 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Onset in adults, clinically resembling multiple sclerosis, also has been reported.</p><p>Whether these variants represent aspartoacylase deficiency is unclear, as they were described prior to the availability of biochemical and molecular diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At that time, the diagnosis was based upon the characteristic clinical features and demonstration of spongiform degeneration of the brain. However, this is a nonspecific pathology shared by a number of other unrelated conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Later studies have not found evidence supporting a distinct juvenile form of aspartoacylase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Rather, they suggest that the disease typically begins in infancy but progresses at a highly variable rate, with no correlation of genotype or residual enzyme activity to clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study reported 22 Ashkenazi infants with Canavan disease and typical onset in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. There were 14 patients younger than age 6 who were clinically stable. Two patients died before the age of 5. Survival beyond age 5 was noted in six patients, with ages at death ranging from 6 to 17 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series of 60 children, mainly Ashkenazi, with onset prior to 10 months of life demonstrated high variability in survival, including significantly different longevity in two siblings from two families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p>The authors in both studies concluded that despite variable survival, these children did not represent variant forms of aspartoacylase deficiency. In subsequent reports, milder disease expression has been associated with specific ASPA gene mutations that may produce a relatively benign phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with aspartoacylase deficiency, cranial imaging by CT and MRI typically shows diffuse and symmetrical white matter involvement. CT shows marked reduction of white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>]. MRI demonstrates white matter that is hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51056\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51056 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F83743\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83743 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>]. Diffusion-weighted MRI sequences reveal that restricted diffusion in deep white matter and brainstem corresponding to cytotoxic brain edema is frequently present early in Canavan disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In individuals with delayed onset and slower progression, brain MRI may show less prominent white matter changes and increased signal intensity in basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/58,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,68,69</a>]. In a case report of a girl with incidentally discovered Canavan disease who had a benign clinical course, there were atypical MRI findings of diffuse T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensity and restricted diffusion involving the cortex and sparing the white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) typically shows markedly increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F83741\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83741 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/65,66,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66,71,72</a>]. MRS is also being studied to track the natural progression of metabolite changes and could serve as a measure for monitoring therapeutic interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In some instances, NAA levels are normal, but other metabolites are reduced, yielding elevated ratios of <span class=\"nowrap\">NAA/choline</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">NAA/creatine</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain weight is increased significantly in aspartoacylase deficiency, reflecting the prominent macrocephaly noted in early infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, by age 30 months, brain weight may be normal, reflecting the progressive white matter loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The gross pathologic findings are dominated by spongy degeneration of deep cortex, subcortical white matter, and cerebellum. The spongiform changes reflect vacuolated astrocytes in deeper cortical layers and in adjacent subcortical white matter. Grossly enlarged Alzheimer type II astrocytes are seen in gray matter.</p><p>Ultrastructural studies reveal disruption of mitochondria in astrocytes. Myelin is markedly reduced and may be virtually absent in some areas. Myelin lamellae within subcortical white matter are separated by vacuoles. With prolonged survival, white matter is depleted and vacuolization is present throughout the cortex.</p><p>Unlike galactosylceramide lipidosis (Krabbe disease) and sulfatide lipidosis (metachromatic leukodystrophy), peripheral nerves are generally uninvolved in aspartoacylase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. An early report, prior to biochemical or molecular diagnosis, did identify peripheral nerve changes including axonopathy and demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As affected individuals are unlikely to reproduce, no information is available regarding pregnancy in patients with aspartoacylase deficiency.</p><p>Findings from the knock-out mouse model suggest reduced reproductive health in the homozygous affected females and heightened fetal lethality (50 percent fewer <span class=\"nowrap\">pups/litter)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspartoacylase-deficiency-canavan-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical diagnosis of aspartoacylase deficiency is relatively straightforward.

The disease typically begins in infancy and is marked by relentless progression. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ASPA gene that encodes the enzyme aspartoacylase. The resulting deficiency of aspartoacylase leads to accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and to oligodendrocyte dysfunction, spongiform changes, and absence of myelin. However, the precise mechanisms causing to spongiform degeneration are uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency is highly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, but is much less common in other populations (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartoacylase deficiency typically presents at about age three months with lethargy and listlessness, weak cry and suck, poor head control, and hypotonia with a paucity of extremity movement. Macrocephaly becomes prominent by three to six months. Thereafter hypotonia progresses to spasticity and tonic extensor spasms. By age six months, neurologic abnormalities are invariant. Little subsequent development is noted. Blindness from optic atrophy occurs between 6 and 18 months. Seizures are noted in about 50 percent of patients. Pseudobulbar signs and decerebrate posturing dominate the end stage. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of variant forms of aspartoacylase deficiency is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Variant forms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain imaging by CT and MRI reveals diffuse and symmetrical white matter involvement. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gross pathologic findings are dominated by spongy degeneration of deep cortex, subcortical white matter, and cerebellum. The spongiform changes reflect vacuolated astrocytes in deeper cortical layers and in adjacent subcortical white matter. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In symptomatic infants with compatible clinical features (eg, hypotonia, poor head control, macrocephaly) and neuroimaging findings, the diagnosis of aspartoacylase deficiency is supported by elevated levels of urine N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) and deficient aspartoacylase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts. Genetic testing may be obtained for purposes of genetic counseling. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of aspartoacylase deficiency includes other progressive white matter diseases of infancy, particularly Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, early-onset adrenoleukodystrophy, Alexander disease, and demyelinating disorders (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No effective treatment is available for aspartoacylase deficiency.
