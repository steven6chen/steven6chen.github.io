The scale was initially developed for screening postpartum women, but is clinically applicable to prenatal depression. Studies in pregnant women have found that the psychometric properties vary widely (sensitivity 70 to 100 percent, specificity 74 to 97 percent, and positive predictive value 22 to 75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The heterogeneity is likely due to screening different populations in different settings, and using different cut-off values to identify a positive screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/54,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57,58</a>]. </p><p>An alternative to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is the self-report, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,49,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,49,59-61</a>]. However, results from the Patient Health Questionnaire should be interpreted judiciously, because the instrument includes items about appetite, energy, and sleep, which may reflect the physical effects of pregnancy rather than depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>We suggest that pregnant patients be screened at least once, based upon the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that clinicians screen perinatal patients at least once [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A reasonable time to screen is in the second trimester.

As part of screening, patients can be counseled about their risk of developing a depressive syndrome, and taught to recognize early symptoms and seek appropriate intervention. Risk factors for prenatal depression are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The evidence that supports screening for antenatal depression is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct evidence &ndash; Systematic reviews have found little to no direct evidence that screening pregnant women for depression is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. As an example, one systematic review identified a single randomized trial (n = 669 pregnant women) that compared screening at week 25 of gestation with usual care; the screening tool was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Among women who were diagnosed with depression, <span class=\"nowrap\">improvement/remission</span> was nearly three times greater in the group that was screened than the controls (relative risk 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect evidence &ndash; Indirect evidence suggests that screening for prenatal depression is beneficial.

The prevalence of depression at follow-up was lower in the groups that were screened than controls, with absolute differences ranging from 5 to 9 percent. In addition, two trials (n &gt;6000 postpartum women) each found that among women who were diagnosed with depression, <span class=\"nowrap\">improvement/remission</span> at follow-up was greater in the groups that were screened than controls. &#160;</p><p/><p>A reasonable alternative to a screening tool is to ask questions such as, &quot;During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?&quot; and &quot;During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,37,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,66</a>]. For patients who endorse dysphoria or anhedonia, follow-up questions can better define the patient's clinical status, including questions as to whether the patient has intrusive thoughts about harming herself or the baby. Patients who screen positive, either with a screening instrument or a few clinical questions, require a clinical interview to make the diagnosis. </p><p>Due to the limited evidence regarding the benefits of screening, some practice guidelines do not endorse universal screening for antenatal depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-during-pregnancy-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary risk factors for antepartum major depression include prior history of depression (either perinatal or nonperinatal depression), current anxiety, unintended or unwanted pregnancy, life stress, intimate partner violence and lifetime history of physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse, and poor social support. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of antenatal depression is unknown. However, several studies suggest that genetic factors are involved. (See <a href=\"#H2040844696\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features and course of illness in pregnant women with unipolar major depression generally resemble the features and course observed in the general population of adults with major depression. However, the prevalence rate for suicide in expectant mothers appears to be lower than the low rate in the general population of women. Women with prenatal major depression typically have comorbid psychopathology, such as anxiety disorders, and the rate of comorbidity appears to be roughly comparable in pregnant and nonpregnant women who are depressed. Episodes of prenatal major depression can persist beyond childbirth and extend into the postpartum period. In addition, women with antenatal depression are at increased risk of suffering another depressive episode after pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent with guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force, we suggest screening all pregnant women for depression when services are in place to ensure appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use the self-report Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67741%7EOBGYN%2F81407\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67741 graphicRef81407 \">figure 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1738045953\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of major depression during pregnancy is suggested by clues such as excessive anxiety about the fetus, poor self-esteem, anhedonia (eg, lack of interest in pregnancy), poor response to support and reassurance, nonadherence to prenatal care, substance use disorders, poor weight gain, and suicidal ideation. (See <a href=\"#H1960995587\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect the disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that the initial assessment of pregnant patients with a possible diagnosis of unipolar major depression focus primarily upon the five mood and cognitive symptoms of major depression: dysphoria, anhedonia, worthlessness or excessive guilt, impaired concentration and decision making, and suicidal ideation and behavior. The somatic symptoms of depression &ndash; changes in sleep, energy level, and appetite &ndash; overlap with normal pregnancy-related changes. Other aspects of the evaluation that are important include general medical health, nutrition, pregnancy complications, attitude towards the pregnancy, relationship with the partner, and social circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H899401067\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The criteria for diagnosing unipolar major depression during pregnancy are the same criteria used in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 2</a>).
