During the initial phase of infection, the organism disseminates widely, setting the stage for subsequent manifestations. If untreated, syphilis can have a number of significant late adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular, gummatous, and neurologic complications. The management of syphilis is based upon its classification into stages of disease: early syphilis (includes primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis); late (includes late latent, cardiovascular, and gummatous syphilis); and neurosyphilis (includes central nervous system disease and ocular syphilis at any time). </p><p>The treatment of syphilis in nonpregnant adults and patient monitoring after treatment will be reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Primary syphilis (chancre)'</a> and <a href=\"#H896098106\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of early syphilis'</a> below.)</p><p>A nontreponemal serologic test should be obtained just before initiating therapy (ideally, on the first day of treatment) to establish the pre-treatment titer. Since nontreponemal titers can increase significantly between the date of diagnosis and the date of treatment, this test is critical to establishing the adequacy of the post-treatment serologic response.

Treatment recommendations are based upon the pharmacokinetics of the available drugs, the microbe's slow growth rate (penicillin is active against dividing organisms and requires prolonged antimicrobial exposure for effective killing), the in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents against <em>T. pallidum</em>, and more than 50 years of clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p>In all types of syphilis, prolonged continuous levels of penicillin are necessary for the elimination of treponemes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the dosage, formulation, and duration of treatment depend upon the stage of disease and whether or not infection involves &quot;protected sites&quot; that sequester <em>T. pallidum </em>(eg, ocular structures, the central nervous system) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50435 \">table 1</a>). As an example, long-acting benzathine penicillin given intramuscularly (standard treatment of early syphilis) provides continuous levels of penicillin in all tissues except these protected sites. Thus, patients with syphilis involving these areas should be treated with intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a>. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of neurosyphilis'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients without neurosyphilis, the appropriate formulation of parenteral penicillin is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a>, which is marketed under the trade name Bicillin L-A.

IM administration of benzathine penicillin produces detectable serum concentrations for up to 30 days. </p><p>Bicillin L-A must be distinguished from Bicillin C-R (which contains equal concentrations of procaine and benzathine penicillin), which should <strong>not</strong> be used to treat patients with syphilis. Bicillin C-R results in detectable serum drug levels for only seven days. Inadvertent use of this shorter-acting preparation in a Los Angeles sexually transmitted disease clinic led to a large-scale public health investigation and retesting and retreatment of a significant number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The Bicillin C-R product is now labeled with a warning: &quot;not for the treatment of syphilis.&quot; This agent is typically used for the treatment of susceptible streptococci.

In addition, use of benzathine penicillin for syphilis treatment should be prioritized for pregnant women, and alternative regimens, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, may need to be utilized for nonpregnant adults if supplies are limited.

The specific treatment regimen depends upon when the patient was exposed (ie, early versus late latent syphilis). In general, we prefer to treat persons in this setting whose exposure is uncertain since the risk of undertreatment typically exceeds that of overtreatment.

During the initial phase of infection, the organism disseminates widely, setting the stage for subsequent manifestations. If untreated, syphilis can have a number of significant late manifestations, including cardiovascular, gummatous, and neurologic complications. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nontreponemal titer should be obtained just before initiating therapy (ideally, on the first day of treatment) since titers can increase significantly over a few days between diagnosis of syphilis and treatment initiation. (See <a href=\"#H4065348473\" class=\"local\">'Pre-treatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillin is the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50435 \">table 1</a>). For patients who are allergic to penicillin, alternative agents include tetracyclines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>. However, we only use azithromycin if no other options are available due to concerns of treatment failure associated with macrolide resistance. (See <a href=\"#H2782145010\" class=\"local\">'General approach to antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonpregnant adults with early syphilis (primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis) without evidence of neurosyphilis, we recommend a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> (2.4 million units intramuscularly [IM]) rather than an extended course of penicillin therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who are allergic to penicillin, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for 14 days rather than another agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H896098106\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of early syphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with tertiary syphilis (gummatous or cardiovascular disease) or late latent syphilis without evidence of neurosyphilis, we suggest IM <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> rather than intravenous (IV) therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An IM injection of 2.4 million units benzathine penicillin should be given once weekly for three weeks. If a patient misses a dose, and if more than 14 days have elapsed since the prior dose, the course should be reinitiated. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of late syphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with neurosyphilis, we recommend IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> rather than IM therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Penicillin G should be administered as 3 to 4 million units IV every four hours (or 18 to 24 million units per day by continuous infusion) for 10 to 14 days. For patients with late disease, we generally administer a single dose of IM benzathine penicillin after the IV course has been completed, since the duration of treatment for neurosyphilis is shorter than the regimens used for late syphilis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of neurosyphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be monitored clinically and with serologic testing after treatment to ensure they are responding appropriately to therapy. A fourfold decline in the nontreponemal titer, equivalent to a change of two dilutions (eg, from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:32 to 1:8), is considered to be an acceptable response. Over time, most patients successfully treated for syphilis experience seroreversion; however, some remain serofast. (See <a href=\"#H1029295266\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1002816367\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with early syphilis, serologic testing should then be performed 6 and 12 months following treatment and at any time if clinical symptoms recur. In general, such patients should experience an adequate response by 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H1002816367\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with late syphilis should undergo follow-up serologic testing at 6, 12, and 24 months, as some patients with late syphilis may not have an adequate response for up to two years following treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1002816367\" class=\"local\">'Serologic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons with syphilis are suspected of treatment failure if nontreponemal titers do not decline fourfold or greater, or if there is a documented fourfold increase after an initial decline. If a patient has not had an adequate response to treatment, it is important to determine if the individual has been reinfected, is experiencing a slow response to treatment, or has failed treatment. Since drug resistance to penicillin has not been described, treatment failure is likely due to poor adherence with the treatment regimen, treatment with an alternative agent, immunocompromised status, or undiagnosed central nervous system disease. (See <a href=\"#H658734623\" class=\"local\">'Management of treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons exposed sexually to a partner who has syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically for evidence of infection. The need for empiric treatment depends primarily upon when the exposure occurred and the stage of their partner&rsquo;s infection. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Treatment after an exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge P Frederick Sparling, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Workowski KA, Bolan GA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
