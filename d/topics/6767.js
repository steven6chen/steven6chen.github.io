Childhood nosebleeds are rarely severe and seldom require hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nonetheless, frequent minor nosebleeds can be both bothersome and alarming for parents and children.</p><p>The evaluation of epistaxis in children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, etiology, and management of epistaxis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although nosebleeds in children are rarely life threatening, the initial evaluation should focus upon the respiratory and hemodynamic stability of the patient rather than the bleeding. Normal appearance, vital signs, and respiratory function are evidence that the examiner can safely attend to the presenting complaint. On the other hand, abnormalities in these indices may signal an emergency. Airway intervention and fluid resuscitation are sometimes necessary in massive epistaxis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Emergency treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The goal of the evaluation is to determine the site and etiology of bleeding. Nosebleeds in children have a variety of etiologies, ranging from self-limited mucosal irritation to life-threatening neoplasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67540 \">table 1</a>). Distinguishing between local and systemic causes of bleeding is critical to the institution of timely and appropriate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid assessment of general appearance, vital signs, airway stability, and mental status are necessary to identify children with respiratory or hemodynamic instability who require airway intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Airway intervention is needed for patients who are spitting or regurgitating blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rapid assessment and stabilization is followed immediately by attempts to identify the source of bleeding and initiation of measures to control it, usually in consultation with otolaryngology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Blood factors or platelets should be administered to patients who have bleeding disorders that can be treated with such products. The remainder of the evaluation is undertaken after the patient is stabilized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important aspects of the history in a child with epistaxis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How old is the child? Epistaxis is rare in children younger than two years (approximately 1 per 10,000) and should prompt consideration of trauma (intentional or unintentional) or serious illness (eg, thrombocytopenia). Epistaxis in this age group has also been associated with asphyxiation, either intentional or unintentional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>] Thus, presence of epistaxis in children younger than two years of age should prompt assessment for other signs of child abuse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When did the bleeding begin? Prolonged bleeding may be suggestive of a bleeding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any prior visits to the emergency department (ED) for epistaxis? Prior ED visits are associated with an increased risk of a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it bilateral or unilateral? Unilateral bleeding indicates that there may be an isolated lesion or minor trauma, whereas bilateral bleeding is more suggestive of general mucosal irritation, systemic etiology or major nasal trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much blood has been lost? Estimation of the quantity of blood loss is difficult; the quantity of bleeding in posterior epistaxis is often underestimated because much of the blood is swallowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there blood in the mouth or vomitus? Posterior bleeding is suggested by initial awareness of bleeding in the back of the throat <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swallowed blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with swallowed blood may present with complaints of hematemesis or melena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What measures were taken to stop the bleeding? Bleeding that is difficult to control with anterior pressure may indicate a bleeding disorder or a posterior source of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of trauma (including nose picking)? Some providers find that asking children which finger they use to pick their nose elicits a more honest answer about nose picking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nasal trauma (ie, a broken nose) usually causes epistaxis that in most cases resolves spontaneously. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of nasal congestion, discharge, or obstruction? Has there been an insertion of a foreign body? Ongoing nasal discharge, especially during the spring and fall implies possible allergic rhinitis. Nasal obstruction with mucopurulent drainage and facial pain, especially during the winter suggests chronic sinusitis. Progressively worsening nasal obstruction over the past several weeks implies possible nasal tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a recent history of nasal surgery. Occasionally children will have epistaxis after an adenoidectomy or other nasal surgery; post-operative epistaxis usually is self-limiting but can require intervention by the otolaryngologist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there associated symptoms? Areas of ecchymosis may indicate a bleeding disorder. Headaches <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facial pain may be related to an intracranial mass. Fever and hepatomegaly suggest the possibility of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Hearing loss and cranial neuropathies may suggest rhabdomyosarcoma. Hearing loss, torticollis, trismus, unilateral cervical adenopathy, retrobulbar or ear pain, and neck pain may suggest nasopharyngeal carcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Past medical history, family history, and review of systems should include information regarding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (particularly nasal corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]), drugs of abuse (cocaine, heroin, inhalants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and <span class=\"nowrap\">complementary/alternative</span> therapies (ie, ginkgo biloba)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number, frequency, and seasonality of previous episodes. Intermittent epistaxis may be caused by changes in the weather, allergies, low humidification of inspired air; colonization with pathologic bacteria (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>). Intermittent epistaxis may also be related to menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of easy bruising or bleeding problems in the patient or family</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the child younger than two years of age, history of apparent life-threatening events or sibling death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of a child with epistaxis can be difficult. For some children, sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesia may be beneficial. Examination of the nasopharynx may be facilitated by the application of a topical vasoconstricting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthetic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> alone or lidocaine mixed with a vasoconstricting agent, such as 0.025 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxymetazoline</a> hydrochloride) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The vasoconstricting agent can be applied with a spray bottle or a cotton pledget (placed into the nose with forceps and removed after five minutes). The nasal cavity may be inspected before or during application of the vasoconstricting agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">General examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with epistaxis should undergo a complete general examination, with special attention to hemodynamic compromise, signs of systemic causes of bleeding, and asphyxiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/2,3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9</a>].

Specific sites to be examined include the nasal septum (Kiesselbach's plexus, presence of a septal perforation), the sphenopalatine artery area (behind the middle turbinate), the ethmoidal vessel area (superior nasal vault), and the nasopharynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54180 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Initial inspection may be accomplished by using one's thumb to push the tip of the nose upward.

A more thorough inspection for anterior septal bleeding can be completed by anterior rhinoscopy using a headlight, or head mirror and nasal speculum. Alternatively, an otoscope with a large tip may be used in the young child who has difficulty holding still. The area of Kiesselbach's plexus should be inspected first since it is the source of the majority of nosebleeds.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Emergency treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history is directed toward determination of the etiology of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of a child with epistaxis can be difficult. For some children, sedation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analgesia may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general examination is directed toward findings related to systemic causes of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'General examination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal and nasopharyngeal examination is directed toward findings related to localized causes of bleeding (mucosal abnormalities, foreign bodies, masses, anatomic abnormalities, vascular abnormalities). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nasopharynx'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine laboratory evaluation is not indicated for most children with self-limited epistaxis. However, evaluation for bleeding disorder (complete blood count, with platelet count and examination of the peripheral smear, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time) is indicated in patients with frequent recurrent nosebleeds, severe nosebleeds that are difficult to control, and those with personal or family history suggestive of a bleeding disorder. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed in children with epistaxis if a mass is visualized or suspected. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epistaxis is associated with asphyxiation in children younger than two years of age with epistaxis and no traumatic injury or bleeding disorder. Careful history, physical examination, and when physical child abuse is suspected, ancillary studies in consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team is warranted in such patients. The evaluation of physical child abuse is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Brown NJ, Berkowitz RG.
