These vessels develop in response to angiogenic factors such as VEGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF - 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>In large part, VEGF is responsible for the loss of integrity of the blood brain barrier in brain tumors. Gliomas, meningiomas, and metastatic tumors all have upregulation of VEGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. VEGF is secreted by tumor cells as well as host stromal cells and binds to its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 which are located primarily on the surface of endothelial cells. VEGF stimulates the formation of gaps in the endothelium, a process that leads to fluid leakage into the brain parenchyma, thereby resulting in vasogenic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Vasogenic edema tends to spread more readily in the extracellular space of white matter rather than gray matter, possibly because of lower resistance to flow within the white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tumor-related edema may disrupt synaptic transmission, alter neuronal excitability, and contribute to headaches, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and encephalopathy. Furthermore, unchecked cerebral edema may result in fatal herniation because the brain is encased in the rigid cranium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with brain tumors and peritumoral edema can be adequately managed with glucocorticoids. Reduction of intracranial pressure and improvement in neurologic symptoms usually begins within hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A decrease in capillary permeability (ie, improvement in blood-brain barrier function) can be identified within six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and changes of diffusion-weighted MRI indicating decreased edema are identifiable within 48 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, adequate reduction in elevated ICP resulting from peritumoral edema may take several days with glucocorticoid therapy alone, and additional treatment may be required in the initial management of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment of elevated ICP'</a> below.)</p><p>Systemic glucocorticoids are indicated in all patients who have symptomatic peritumoral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> is the standard agent, because its relative lack of mineralocorticoid activity reduces the potential for fluid retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, dexamethasone may be associated with a lower risk of infection and cognitive impairment compared to other glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of action of glucocorticoids for control of vasogenic edema is not fully understood. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexamethasone</a> has recently been shown to upregulate Ang-1, a strong BBB-stabilizing factor, whereas it downregulates VEGF, a strong permeabilizing factor, in astrocytes and pericytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Glucocorticoids may also increase the clearance of peritumoral edema by facilitating the transport of fluid into the ventricular system, from which it is cleared by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bulk flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with severe symptoms, the usual initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> regimen consists of a 10 mg loading dose, followed by 4 mg four times per day. For most patients, however, smaller total daily doses (4 to 8 per day) are adequate and less toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A total maintenance dose of 16 mg per day is typically reserved for patients with significant edema and deficits.</p><p>Although it has been customary to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> in four divided daily doses, its biological half-life is sufficiently long (36 to 54 hours) to allow once or twice daily dosing, and this approach is often used for maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. To minimize complications, subsequent dosing should be modified to use the lowest possible dose necessary to control peritumoral edema. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Absorption of oral glucocorticoids is excellent and is complete within 30 minutes of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Intravenous dosing may be necessary if oral absorption cannot be assured, or if mentation is altered.</p><p>Most patients begin to improve symptomatically within hours and achieve a maximum benefit from a given dose of glucocorticoids within 24 to 72 hours, although standard neuroimaging studies may not reveal decreased edema for at least a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In general, headaches tend to respond better than focal deficits. If a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> dose of 16 mg per day is insufficient, the dose may be increased further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Once patients have responded, glucocorticoids should be gradually withdrawn if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, the most commonly used glucocorticoid for brain edema, has a long duration of action, the drug should be tapered about every four days. For patients in good clinical condition, this may entail a reduction in dose of up to 50 percent every four days. However, for those not tolerating glucocorticoid withdrawal, a more protracted course and chronic treatment may be required.</p><p>These recommendations are consistent with a systematic review and evidence-based clinical guidelines for the use of steroids in brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Those guidelines recommended a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> of 16 mg per day or more for patients with severe symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure and edema due to brain metastases. For patients with milder symptoms, a starting dose of 4 to 8 mg of dexamethasone daily was recommended; steroids are not recommended for asymptomatic patients. Based upon this review the drug should be tapered slowly over a two week time period or longer in symptomatic patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids, they are associated with a large number of well-known side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71400 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>). The frequency of these complications can be reduced by using the lowest possible dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Common side effects include insomnia, essential tremor, and hiccups; patients should be warned in advance that they may occur. Three complications are of particular concern to patients with brain tumors: gastrointestinal complications, steroid myopathy, and opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. In addition, retrospective studies have suggested that use of steroids may be associated with decreased overall survival in patients with glioblastoma, independent of potential confounding factors such as tumor size and performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, especially when used in conjunction with other drugs such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Concurrent anticoagulation therapy and a prior history of peptic ulcer disease are other factors that can increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving glucocorticoids.</p><p>The effectiveness of prophylactic therapy to prevent peptic ulceration in patients with brain tumors (especially those with gliomas and lymphomas, who often require prolonged therapy with high doses of glucocorticoids) is unknown. In NSAID-treated patients, proton pump inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>) can protect against both gastric and duodenal ulcerations. However, there are no studies evaluating the efficacy of these drugs in patients with brain tumors treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. Standard doses of H2 blockers are <strong>not</strong> effective for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We usually restrict prophylactic therapy with a proton pump inhibitor to the perioperative period and to patients receiving very high doses of glucocorticoids. For other patients, prophylactic therapy is probably unnecessary unless they are at high risk for developing peptic ulceration (eg, previous peptic ulcer disease, concurrent anticoagulation, NSAID therapy). When NSAIDs are necessary, use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> appears to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A less well recognized complication of glucocorticoid therapy is perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. This is frequently difficult to diagnose because clinical features of peritonitis can be masked by the glucocorticoids. The prevention of severe constipation may decrease the risk of intestinal perforation. A high index of suspicion is important since early diagnosis improves the outcome of this serious complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Steroid myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy contributes significantly to morbidity in patients with brain tumors. Myopathy is a common complication, with an estimated incidence between 2 and 20 percent. The risk of developing steroid myopathy appears to be significantly lower in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, possibly due to induction of hepatic metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> by phenytoin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients develop proximal weakness between the ninth and twelfth weeks of glucocorticoid treatment, although there is marked variation in individual susceptibility. Some patients become weak after a low dose of glucocorticoids for a few weeks, while others never develop myopathy despite receiving large doses of glucocorticoids for months or years. The onset is usually subacute, occurring over several weeks. Muscle pain is not a feature and tendon reflexes are preserved.</p><p>Treatment of steroid myopathy is difficult. Ideally, glucocorticoids should be discontinued but the lowest possible dose should be used if this is not feasible. Recovery after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy can be expected within two to three months but may be much slower if treatment is continued, even at a reduced dose.</p><p>Another treatment approach is to change the glucocorticoid preparation. Steroid myopathy has been particularly associated with the use of fluorinated glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. Although the evidence supporting this relationship is not strong, anecdotal reports suggest that weakness that develops during treatment with a fluorinated glucocorticoid may improve when equivalent doses of a nonfluorinated preparation, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, are substituted. Some reports indicate that growth hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], insulin-like growth factor-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and amino acid supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] may ameliorate the weakness of steroid myopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumocystis pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection that occurs in immunocompromised hosts, including patients with brain tumors treated with glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of symptomatic PCP infection is increased while glucocorticoids are being tapered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Concurrent chemotherapy may be an additional risk factor for the development of PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a retrospective review of 587 patients with primary brain tumors seen at a single institution over an eight year period, there were 11 histologically documented cases of PCP in 10 patients (1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The patients had been on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> for a median duration of three months when symptoms first developed. In 8 of 11 episodes, PCP occurred during the steroid taper.</p><p>The mechanism by which glucocorticoids predispose to the development of PCP is poorly understood, but suppression of cellular immunity leading to reactivation of latent infection probably plays a role. Why PCP more commonly develops during steroid taper is also unknown. Possible factors include increased immune-mediated lung damage from PCP infection, which had been suppressed by higher doses of glucocorticoids, and a positive effect of glucocorticoids on surfactant phospholipids that are decreased in PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Physicians caring for patients with brain tumors who are receiving glucocorticoids should maintain a high index of suspicion for PCP. Although the hallmark of PCP is fever and dyspnea with or without a prominent dry cough, the presentation can be subtle and nonspecific. Thus, the diagnosis should be considered in any patient developing respiratory symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-immunocompromised-patient-with-fever-and-pulmonary-infiltrates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of PCP pneumonia in patients with brain tumors is the same as in other non-HIV infected patients and is discussed elsewhere. Because of the risk of PCP and its associated morbidity and mortality, we suggest PCP prophylaxis in patients who are receiving prolonged (more than six weeks) courses of glucocorticoids, especially as steroid therapy is withdrawn. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE TREATMENT OF ELEVATED ICP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant increase in ICP can be a medical emergency, and treatment should be undertaken as expeditiously as possible.
