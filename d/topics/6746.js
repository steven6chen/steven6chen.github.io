The traumatic causes of shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents and the physical examination of the shoulder are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic causes of acute shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H231969948\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric shoulder injuries are very common, accounting for approximately one million outpatients visits annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among active children and adolescents, the incidence of shoulder injuries increases as the participation in overhead activities such as baseball and volleyball rises. Despite the risk for traumatic shoulder injury during any competitive activity, the largest risk for shoulder injury remains during contact sports such as football and rugby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296644501\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complex network of anatomic structures endows the human shoulder with tremendous mobility, greater than any other joint in the body. The shoulder girdle is composed of three bones (the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus) and four articular surfaces (sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular [AC], glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). The glenohumeral joint, commonly referred to as the shoulder joint, is the principal articulation. The shoulder is an inherently unstable joint that relies on several delicate interactions to minimize the risk for injury. The shape and interaction of the bones and soft tissues of the shoulder girdle are essential to understanding the factors leading to shoulder stability and to identify injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glenohumeral structures</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> The glenohumeral joint is loosely constrained within a thin capsule bounded by surrounding muscles and ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70854 \">table 1</a>). The shoulder's great mobility is due in large part to the shallow depth of the glenoid and the limited contact between the glenoid and the humeral head. Only 25 percent of the humeral head surface makes contact with the glenoid. The labrum, a fibrocartilaginous ring attached to the outer rim of the glenoid, provides some additional depth and stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It also serves as a bumper to decrease the potential for humeral head subluxation. The shallowness and small surface area of the glenohumeral joint make it susceptible to instability and injury and require that stability be provided primarily by extrinsic supports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surrounding muscles and ligaments provide these supports:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The glenohumeral ligaments are collagenous reinforcement of the capsule and quite variable in their thickness, anatomic position, and their contribution to shoulder stability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54102 \">figure 1B</a>). The glenohumeral ligaments serve as the primary static stabilizer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The inferior glenohumeral ligament complex (IGHL) is made up of the anterior and posterior bands and the posterior axillary pouch that form a hammock like structure. In abduction and external rotation, the anterior band is the primary restraint to anterior translation of the humeral head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the absence of the anterior IGHL, the middle glenohumeral ligament may provide some restraint to anterior humeral translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In the flexion and internal rotation, the posterior band of the IGHL and the posterior capsule are the primary restraints for posterior movement (translation) of the humeral head relative to the glenoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rotator cuff serves as the primary dynamic stabilizer. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor) that form a cuff around the head of the humerus, to which these muscles attach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027 \">figure 2</a>). The rotator cuff compresses the humoral head in the glenoid fossa, thereby stabilizing the glenohumeral joint, and serves to counterbalance the elevating forces of the deltoid, as well as the forces of other muscles acting on the humerus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Glenohumeral structures'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other structures</strong> &ndash; The clavicle serves as a strut attaching the upper extremity to the axial skeleton through the AC and sternoclavicular joints and the scapulothoracic articulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). The function of the clavicle includes supporting the weight of the arm, providing additional dynamic mobility to the arm, and transferring force from the arm to the rest of the skeleton.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sternoclavicular joint has the least amount of bony stability of the major joints of the body, but paradoxically bears the responsibility of being the only true articulation between the upper extremity and the axial skeleton. The convex articular surface of the clavicle is much larger than the curved notch of the sternum resulting in an incongruous mismatch. Despite this instability, dislocation at this joint is rare. Both bones are covered with thick fibrocartilage (not the usual hyaline cartilage) and are separated by an intervening fibrocartilage disk which provide added cushion to the joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The muscles primarily responsible for scapular stability and motion are the trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboids, and levator scapulae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50894\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50894 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The AC joint is supported by ligaments that span its anterior, superior, posterior, and inferior aspects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016 \">picture 1</a>). These ligaments also envelop the distal 1 to 2 cm of the clavicle. In addition to the AC ligaments, the distal clavicle is held in alignment with the acromion by the strong coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments. These ligaments consist of the conoid ligament medially and the trapezoid ligament laterally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bony development</strong> &ndash; As a general rule, the bones that form the shoulder girdle (ie, scapula, humerus, and clavicle) are not fully ossified in children and young adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83709 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-traumatic-shoulder-injury-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>]. Thus, the skeletally immature athlete has open epiphyses that are two to five times weaker than the surrounding soft tissues and are prone to fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some patients, skeletal immaturity or variation in ossification can lead to misdiagnosis as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A lateral epiphysis fracture of the clavicle can be confused with an AC joint injury (eg, AC sprain or separation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bipartite coracoid may be mistaken as a coracoid fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salter I fracture of the proximal humerus may be misdiagnosed as a soft tissue injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medial clavicular epiphysis fracture can be confused with a sternoclavicular dislocation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Os acromiale can be mistaken for an acromion fracture.</p><p/><p>The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, which makes it inherently unstable. Skeletally immature adolescents and children have different injuries compared with adults based on their anatomy. The shoulder girdle is composed of three bones (the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus), which are not fully ossified in the children and young adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83709 \">table 2</a>). Open physes are two to five times weaker than the surrounding soft tissues and are prone to fracture. There are also four articular surfaces in the shoulder girdle (sternoclavicular, AC, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). Understanding the complex shoulder anatomy will help identify and prevent injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2856990024\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of pain helps to narrow the differential diagnosis of acute traumatic shoulder injury and focus the evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F114740\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114740 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1603765765\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History, physical examination, and imaging typically establishes the diagnosis of acute traumatic shoulder pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2144532714\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify life-threatening injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In all traumatized adolescents and children presenting with shoulder pain, begin with a neck examination and assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status to ensure there is no life-threatening injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a concern for neck injury should undergo cervical spinal motion restriction (immobilization) before further examination. There should be no focal neck tenderness or neurologic deficit before proceeding to evaluate for an isolated shoulder injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180550110\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A routine history will aid in the diagnosis of shoulder pain. Understanding the location of pain and mechanism of injury will further guide the physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. Pain with shoulder movement, limited range of motion, and decreased strength compared with the unaffected side suggest intrinsic shoulder pathology. Referred pain to the shoulder is possible with more serious injuries such as abdominal, cardiac, and cervical spine pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H803732448\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sternoclavicular injury</strong> &ndash; The most common mechanism is a large indirect force on the anterolateral or posterolateral shoulder. Less commonly, injuries may also result from direct trauma (eg, misplaced kick to the medial clavicle and sternum during soccer or mixed martial arts competition or a helmet blow during American football). Patients will describe anterior shoulder or chest pain. Posterior sternoclavicular dislocations may present with patients complaining of dyspnea, dysphagia, or hoarseness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents#H335289\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic causes of acute shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sternoclavicular injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clavicular injury</strong> &ndash; The mechanism of injury most commonly consists of a fall onto the point of the shoulder but may include a fall onto outstretched arm or direct trauma. Clavicle fractures often occur in the middle third of the shaft. Focal tenderness and swelling are common following injury. Often a snapping or cracking sensation will be described at time of injury. Patients will also complain of worsening pain with shoulder movement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents#H2619337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic causes of acute shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clavicle injuries'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient fell directly on the distal shoulder and points to the distal clavicle as the source of pain, the patient may have a distal clavicle fracture, or acromioclavicular (AC) injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents#H683479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic causes of acute shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Distal clavicle contusion (shoulder pointer)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biceps tendonitis</strong> &ndash; Although uncommon, acute injury in adolescents may exacerbate biceps tendonitis with anterior pain over the bicipital groove and may radiate distally toward the biceps muscle. Patients will describe worsening pain with overhead activity or lifting objects. Pain is secondary to overuse from repetitive trauma to the tendon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acromioclavicular injury</strong> &ndash; AC injuries almost always affect adolescents, rather than prepubertal children, and occur from direct trauma to the shoulder, falling on the point of the shoulder with arm adducted, or falling on an outstretched hand. Pain will be anterolateral over the AC joint. Patients will complain of worsening pain with shoulder flexion and adduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;, section on 'History and examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial contusion</strong> &ndash; Bruises in the anterior shoulder area typically occur after a direct blow and may cause significant pain with limitation of motion. Patients complain of pain at the site of injury. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1587723984\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scapula fracture</strong> &ndash; Scapula fractures occur following high force trauma such as from a motor vehicle collision, fall from a height, or direct blow in football. Due to the mechanism of injury, scapula fractures are not often an isolated injury; further evaluation for life-threatening or associated injuries is necessary. Patients will have pain posteriorly that worsens with shoulder movement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-causes-of-acute-shoulder-pain-and-injury-in-children-and-adolescents#H2620553\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic causes of acute shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Scapula fractures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial contusion</strong> &ndash; Bruises in the posterior shoulder area typically occur after a direct blow and may cause significant pain with limitation of motion. Patients complain of pain at the site of injury. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3791369003\"><span class=\"h3\">Poorly localized pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proximal humerus fracture</strong> &ndash; High-energy direct trauma and falls onto an outstretched hand can cause proximal humerus fractures. Most common is a history of falling backwards on an outstretched arm. Patients will describe pain and swelling of the shoulder. Pain is often diffuse but may localize over the greater tuberosity. They will present with their arm adducted and held tightly against their chest to minimize movement. They may also describe decreased sensation along the axillary nerve distribution (skin over the lateral shoulder [&quot;shoulder badge&quot; distribution]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-humeral-fractures-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal humeral fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Proximal humerus fractures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms of proximal humeral fracture after minimal trauma raises the concern for a pathologic fracture through a benign or malignant lesion (eg, osteochondroma, unicameral bone cysts, nonossifying fibromas, malignant chondroblastoma, osteogenic sarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nonfocal shoulder pain in skeletally immature baseball pitchers suggests proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (Little League shoulder) caused by microtrauma at the proximal humeral physis during throwing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=throwing-injuries-of-the-upper-extremity-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-approach#H78248393\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (Little League shoulder)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A humeral fracture arising from a reported low force mechanism (eg, being hit by a toy or other object) or without a plausible history in any patient less than one year of age should lead to careful evaluation for child abuse including consultation with a child abuse specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H706482265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Fractures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H2461149\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glenohumeral dislocation, subluxation, and instability </strong>&ndash; Although more common in skeletally mature adolescents and rare in children younger than 12 years of age, anterior and posterior glenohumeral dislocations may still occur in children. Anterior dislocations typically follow a force to the abducted, externally rotated and extended arm, force to the posterior shoulder, or a fall on an outstretched hand (eg, blocking a basketball shot or arm tackling in American football as a player runs past). Posterior shoulder dislocations result following force to the anterior shoulder or axial loading of an adducted and internally rotated arm (eg, lineman blocking in American football). In either case patients will present with severe shoulder pain and limited movement. Shoulder subluxation and instability often present with similar findings to shoulder dislocations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dislocation and reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643777045\"><span class=\"h3\">Referred pain/extrinsic</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical spine injury</strong> &ndash; Injuries to the cervical spine occur following an axial load. Patients may also describe hyperflexion or hyperextension of the neck at the time of axial loading. Patients frequently report neck pain. Neurologic symptoms may also be described in the history including transient or permanent paralysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abdominal injury</strong> &ndash; Referred pain to the shoulder from an abdominal injury occurs from free intraperitoneal blood irritating the diaphragm. Patients with referred pain will describe a direct force to the abdomen. In addition to also complaining of abdominal pain they may describe symptoms of hypovolemia such as dizziness and light-headedness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver, spleen, and pancreas injury in children with blunt abdominal trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myocardial injury</strong> &ndash; Blunt cardiac trauma may rarely present with myocardial ischemia and referred pain to the shoulder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachial plexus injuries (burners and stingers)</strong> &ndash; Injuries occur as a result of compression, traction, or direct force to the brachial plexus. Traction occurs when the shoulder is depressed and the head is forced away from the injured side (eg, during tackling in American football), while compression of the nerve roots occurs when the head is forced to the side of injury. Patients will describe burning or stinging pain down one arm that resolves within seconds to minutes. They may be seen shaking their arm at the time of injury or holding their arm close to the body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burners-stingers-acute-brachial-plexus-injury-in-the-athlete#H603285608\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burners (stingers): Acute brachial plexus injury in the athlete&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spontaneous axillary or subclavian vein thrombosis (Paget Schroetter disease)</strong> &ndash; Most often spontaneous axillary or subclavian vein thrombosis (Paget Schroetter disease) is associated with repetitive overhand movements which can compress the axillary and subclavian veins. It may also occur following a single traumatic event around the shoulder or clavicle such as a clavicle fracture. Patients will complain of pain, diffuse swelling, numbness and easy fatigability in the affected arm. An elevated D-dimer raises suspicion for thrombosis and ultrasonography provides a rapid means of confirmation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis#H351070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary (spontaneous) upper extremity deep vein thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis#H185997417\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary (spontaneous) upper extremity deep vein thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thoracic outlet syndrome</strong> &ndash; Thoracic outlet syndrome may rarely be found during evaluation for incidental shoulder trauma. It results from compression of the neurovascular bundle. This may be caused by hypertrophy of the scalene muscles, a long transverse process, cervical ribs or other rib anomalies, fibromuscular bands, or repetitive shoulder movements. Patients may present with neurogenic, venous, or arterial complaints. Often, they will describe symptoms worsening while lifting heavy objects and overhead activity in addition to paresthesias and numbness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thoracic-outlet-syndromes#H293627701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thoracic outlet syndromes&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3996120227\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the shoulder in children is guided by history. The performance of the shoulder examination is discussed in detail separately.

Normal shoulder examination despite significant pain suggests referred pain caused by more serious injuries such as abdominal, cardiac, and cervical spine pathology.
