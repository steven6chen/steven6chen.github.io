Atypical squamous cells (ASC) is the name given to squamous cells on a Pap test (also called a Pap smear or cervical cytology) that do not have a normal appearance but are not clearly precancerous. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) on a Pap test are cells that appear slightly abnormal.</p><p>Cervical cancer screening is recommended starting at age 21 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 1</a>). Women who have ASC or LSIL on a Pap test require further testing because some women with these findings have a precancerous lesion of the cervix.</p><p>This topic discusses the management of women with ASC and LSIL. The management of women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and atypical glandular cells (AGC) is discussed in a separate topic.

A squamous intraepithelial lesion can be low-grade (low risk of developing into cervical cancer) or high-grade (precancerous cells with a moderate to high risk of developing into cervical cancer). The risk of a high-grade precancerous lesion in women with ASC-US is as high as 18 percent and for those with ASC-H, the risk is as high as 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-of-low-grade-abnormal-pap-tests-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Cervical cancer screening is recommended starting at age 21 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASC-US Pap tests are managed differently in women ages 21 to 24 than in those ages 25 and older.</p><p>There are two options for women with an ASC-US Pap test who are <strong>ages</strong> <strong>25 or older</strong>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This is the preferred follow-up for ASC-US in women 25 and older. HPV infection is the cause of nearly all cancer of the cervix. There are many strains of HPV, some of which can infect the cervix, and only some of these are high risk for causing cervical precancer or cancer. The HPV testing done by clinicians is only for these high-risk strains. Use of testing for high-risk HPV gives important information about whether a woman with an ASC-US Pap test is at risk of cervical cancer. HPV testing is often done at the same time as the Pap test. HPV testing is described in detail in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Women who test positive for HPV should have colposcopy. Colposcopy is an examination of the cervix using a type of microscope, which is done in the clinician&rsquo;s office. Colposcopy is discussed in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Colposcopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Women who test negative for HPV are not likely to have cervical precancer. These women should have a repeat Pap test and HPV testing in three years. In most cases, the ASC-US resolves during this time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat the Pap test in one year. If this test is normal, the woman can return to regular screening. If an abnormality is found, then a colposcopy should be done.</p><p/><p>HPV testing is not a usual part of screening for cervical cancer for women <strong>ages 21 to 24</strong>. This is because HPV infection is common in young women, but often goes away and usually does not cause cervical precancer or cancer. For women in this age group with an ASC-US Pap test, there are two options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat the Pap test in one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another option is to do an HPV test.
