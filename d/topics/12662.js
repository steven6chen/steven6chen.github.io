Of the acute leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs five times more commonly than acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survival rates for ALL have improved dramatically since the 1980s, with current five-year overall survival rates estimated at greater than 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Five-year event-free survival rates are &gt;93 percent for low-risk groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This improvement in survival is due to treatment of a large number of children on sequential standardized research protocols. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of children with newly diagnosed ALL participate in such trials, the goals of which are to improve clinical outcomes while minimizing acute toxicities and late-occurring adverse events. </p><p>The treatment of ALL in children is reviewed here. The epidemiology, presentation, classification, risk group stratification, and outcome of childhood ALL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the presentation and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-group-stratification-and-prognosis-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk group stratification and prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the majority of children with ALL will be cured, consultation with palliative care specialists may be considered at the time of diagnosis as with any life-threatening condition or for pain management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful treatment of children with ALL involves administration of a multidrug regimen that is divided into several phases (ie, induction, consolidation, and maintenance) and includes therapy directed to the central nervous system (CNS). Most treatment protocols take two to three years to complete, although the specific regimen varies depending upon immunophenotype and risk category (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71649 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-group-stratification-and-prognosis-for-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk group stratification and prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At the time of diagnosis, patients with ALL commonly require transfusion support, treatment of suspected or proven infections with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and, for patients with a high tumor burden, correction of any metabolic imbalances such as hyperuricemia. A rare patient may require leukapheresis or exchange transfusion to control extreme leukocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-renal-diseases#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid renal diseases&quot;, section on 'Acute uric acid nephropathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperleukocytosis-and-leukostasis-in-hematologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in hematologic malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite improvements in supportive care, death resulting from treatment toxicity remains a challenge. In a review of over 1000 children with ALL treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of treatment-related death was 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Age was the only predictor of death; children in the age bracket from one to nine years had a significantly lower risk of treatment-related mortality than did either infants or older children. In a subsequent retrospective analysis of 8516 children ages 0 to 19 years of age with newly-diagnosed ALL treated at US institutions, induction mortality was 1.12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Induction mortality was not associated with race or socio-economic status, but was increased among children age &lt;1 year (hazard ratio [HR] 3.34, 95% CI 1.22-9.13) and 10 to 19 years (HR 2.89, 95% CI 1.55-5.41) and among those with cardio-respiratory or other organ failure (HR 145.4, 95% CI 37.8-145.4).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338079952\"><span class=\"h2\">Regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction therapy is the initial phase of treatment. The primary goal of induction is achievement of an initial complete remission (CR), defined as the eradication of all detectable leukemia cells (less than 5 percent blasts) from the bone marrow and blood and the restoration of normal hematopoiesis (&gt;25 percent cellularity and normal peripheral blood counts). The induction therapy given differs depending upon whether a t(9;22) translocation (Philadelphia chromosome) is present. While t(9;22) translocation is uncommon in children, those with this translocation benefit from the addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the aberrant expression of BCR-ABL1. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594730008\"><span class=\"h3\">t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1 negative ALL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 90 percent of children and adolescents with ALL enter complete remission (CR) at the end of induction therapy regardless of their initial risk grouping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-17</a>].</p><p>Induction therapy usually involves weekly administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vincristine</a> for three to four weeks, daily corticosteroids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>), and asparaginase. Asparaginase is available as an <em>E. coli</em> derivative, either in its native form (L-asparaginase) or in its pegylated form (Oncaspar) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The pegylated form results in a longer period of asparagine depletion with comparable toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. L-asparaginase is no longer available for use in the United States. For patients with <em>E. coli</em> asparaginase allergies, asparaginase is also available from Erwinia (Erwinase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A fourth agent such as an anthracycline (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">doxorubicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daunorubicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">daunorubicin</a>) may be added to the three-drug regimen, particularly for high-risk patients. </p><p>Response to therapy is often assessed by bone marrow examination during the induction phase of treatment. In addition to morphologic response, bone marrow aspirates are also assessed for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Assessments can be performed by either quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Both methods have shown that end-of induction and end-of consolidation bone marrow MRD strongly correlate with survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24,25</a>].

Patients who respond rapidly to the induction regimen appear to have a more favorable outcome, whereas those who have a slow response or who fail induction therapy have a more guarded prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21-25</a>].

Although the <span class=\"nowrap\">t(9;22)/<em>BCR-ABL1</em></span> translocation was formerly associated with a very poor prognosis, outcome has significantly improved with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imatinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, to therapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. In a prospective clinical trial from the Children's Oncology Group (COG), 91 children (age 1 to 21 years) with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL were treated with intensive chemotherapy plus imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Those treated from induction until the completion of therapy with imatinib had the best outcome, with a five-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 70 percent. DFS was not statistically different between patients treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib (70&plusmn;12 percent, n = 28) versus those who underwent sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) (65&plusmn;11 percent, n = 21) or those receiving an unrelated donor HCT (59&plusmn;15 percent, n = 13).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338080258\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with trisomy 21</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with trisomy <span class=\"nowrap\">21/Down</span> syndrome who develop ALL (DS-ALL) are particularly susceptible to adverse events and treatment-related mortality. Intensive chemotherapy regimens with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> frequently result in severe mucositis, and children with DS-ALL have an increased risk of severe infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. An analysis of 653 children with DS-ALL demonstrated that these patients have both a high rate of relapse (26 percent eight-year cumulative relapse incidence) and an increased rate of two-year treatment-related mortality (7 versus 2 percent in non-DS-ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In general, many patients can be cured without the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which has been associated with high treatment mortality. </p><p>Although cytogenetic changes other than trisomy 21 are uncommon with DS-ALL, those with concurrent low-risk cytogenetics (ETV-RUNX1) comprise a risk group with an exceptionally good prognosis (eight-year event-free survival 95&plusmn;4 percent).

These same unfavorable features, except for male sex and CNS involvement, were also associated with reduced survival after induction failure. At a median follow-up of 8.3 years, the estimated overall survival (OS) at 10 years for patients with induction failure who did not demonstrate t(9;22)(<em>BCR-ABL1</em>) was 32 percent.

Ongoing treatment is required because small numbers of leukemic lymphoblasts remain in the bone marrow despite histologic and molecular evidence of CR after induction therapy. In such cases, relapse occurs quickly if therapy is not continued. The goal of post-induction chemotherapy is to prevent leukemic regrowth, reduce residual tumor burden, and prevent the emergence of drug-resistance in the remaining leukemic cells.</p><p>There is evidence that leukemias undergo a process known as clonal evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. During induction, the vast numbers of leukemia cells originating from the dominant subclone are eliminated. However, leukemia-initiating cells are often from a heterogeneous population at diagnosis, with individual patients having multiple genetic subclones with leukemia-initiating potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. These subclones are present within a complex clonal architecture at diagnosis, and often potentially chemoresistant leukemia-initiation cells are present but are undetectable by minimal residual disease (MRD) assays. Post-induction therapies can help prevent the emergence of a drug resistance by eliminating these subdominant clones that were resistant to induction therapy.

This has allowed a reduction of intensification therapy for patients with good prognosis while providing more intensive treatment for those in the high-risk groups. End of induction MRD, as well as cytogenetics and molecular abnormalities, are the most important predictors of disease-free and overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,23,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23,90</a>]. Patients with detectable MRD have an increased risk of relapse following conventional chemotherapy. </p><p>Ongoing trials are evaluating the escalation of consolidation therapy intensity for patients who are MRD positive following induction, and the reduction of therapy intensity in MRD negative cases. As an example, in one trial (UKALL 2003), 533 patients clinically identified as having standard-risk or intermediate-risk ALL at diagnosis and MRD positivity (leukemia cells &gt;0.01 percent) in the bone marrow at the end of induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive either standard or augmented post-remission therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

Augmented therapy was associated with more adverse events including hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, and <span class=\"nowrap\">mucositis/stomatitis</span>. After a median follow-up of 70 months, augmented therapy resulted in superior five-year event-free survival (90 versus 83 percent; p = 0.04). However, overall survival was not statistically different between the standard and augmented therapy groups (93 versus 89 percent, p = 0.16). Similar strategies of therapy intensification for patients that are MRD positive after induction are underway in Europe and the United States.

Delayed intensification involves the administration of a five- to eight-week &quot;pulse&quot; of intensive, multi-agent chemotherapy similar to that administered during induction and consolidation. Delayed intensification pulses were given either once [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>] or twice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>] during the first six months of post-remission therapy. Although the benefit of two pulses of delayed intensification has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,97</a>], the addition of a single delayed intensification pulse has improved survival for both standard and high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/96,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,98</a>]. </p><p>The intensity of delayed intensification therapy is commensurate with the patient's risk grouping. As a general rule, the higher the risk for treatment failure, the more aggressive intensification therapy is required. This was demonstrated in a Children's Oncology Group trial of 1299 patients with higher risk ALL that had rapid marrow response to induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

They remain at risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections during periods of neutropenia, and fevers should be aggressively treated. Patients can also experience many of the same complications (eg, infection) seen during induction therapy, although these are usually less common. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p>More aggressive treatment regimens involving multiple chemotherapeutic agents place high-risk patients at risk for additional complications.

After completion of the consolidation or intensification phase of therapy, patients often receive a less intensive continuation regimen (eg, maintenance chemotherapy) using daily oral 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>], weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> with periodic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, and intrathecal therapy. 6-MP can be administered as a tablet or as an oral suspension. </p><p>Children and families must be educated regarding the importance of maintenance therapy. The importance of compliance with 6-MP was illustrated in a cohort study that demonstrated an association between decreased adherence rates and an increased risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Better medication adherence is associated with a consistent daily routine for 6-MP ingestion that integrates with the family's lifestyle (ie, selecting either morning or evening dosing) and removing commonly practiced restrictions regarding coadministration of 6-MP with food or milk products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].

The optimal time interval for vincristine plus steroid pulses is also unclear; this question is currently being studied in a large prospective COG trial. Patients with high-risk ALL, such as infants with ALL, may require a more aggressive continuation regimen with additional drug combinations.</p><p>During maintenance therapy, patients remain at risk for infection.

Once a patient enters the less intensive maintenance therapy, however, the primary care provider (PCP) can often provide routine medical care with scheduled visits to the oncologist for chemotherapy, particularly if the family lives some distance from the oncology treatment center. When ALL therapy is complete, the PCP resumes primary care for the patient, including visits for health maintenance and acute illnesses.</p><p>During chemotherapy, the oncologist usually coordinates physical examinations, procedures, and imaging studies. The PCP, however, plays an important role in encouraging patients to return to their oncologist for scheduled visits and follow-up studies. Encouragement to maintain regularly scheduled follow-up visits with their oncologist is particularly important after the completion of chemotherapy treatment. Communication between the PCP and the oncologist is critical throughout the treatment process.</p><p>The purpose of frequent follow-up visits after the cessation of chemotherapy is to examine ALL survivors for disease recurrence and to screen them for the long-term side effects. Patients are closely followed for several years after completion of chemotherapy. Although there is no standard follow-up frequency, patients are typically seen by their oncologist monthly for the first year after therapy completion and then at less frequent intervals for the next two to four years. After three to five years, patients are followed on an annual basis with a focus on long-term survivor issues.

Live-virus vaccines, such as MMR and oral poliovirus, are contraindicated. After completion of chemotherapy, the patient should receive any missed vaccinations, including MMR and varicella.</p><p>Cancer patients have a variable response to the immunizations received while immunosuppressed.

Healthcare providers should pay close attention to persistent abnormal blood counts in the ALL survivor. Monitoring for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) is also common practice in patients who have had a stem cell transplant as part of their treatment regimen. Prompt referral for bone marrow examination is warranted if there is suppression of more than one cell line (white cells, red cells, platelets) or unexplained suppression of one cell line that persists for longer than three to four weeks.
