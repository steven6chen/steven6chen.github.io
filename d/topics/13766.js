Heart failure is the most common cause of this problem. Pleural effusion can also be caused by an infection, cancer, or other health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662417\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pleural effusion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; This pain can be sharp and get worse when you cough or take a deep breath. Sometimes the pain is a dull ache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems &ndash; You might breathe faster than normal or feel short of breath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hiccups</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662432\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests for pleural effusion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests for pleural effusion include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An X-ray of your chest</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of your chest &ndash; This is a special type of X-ray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to take pictures of the fluid around your lungs. Your doctor might do this test if you need to have some fluid taken out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracentesis &ndash; This is the name for a test in which a doctor takes a sample of fluid from around your lung. This is done using a needle that goes through the skin on your chest. Another doctor then checks the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662447\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pleural effusion treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on your symptoms and the cause of the problem. If you are having trouble breathing, your doctor will remove the fluid from around your lungs with a needle or plastic tube.</p><p>If heart failure caused the fluid around your lungs, your doctor will prescribe medicines called &quot;diuretics.&quot; These help pull fluid out of your lungs. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">furosemide</a> (brand name: Lasix) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">torsemide</a> (brand name: Demadex). You might also need to take other medicines for heart failure.</p><p>If an infection caused the fluid around your lungs, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Your doctor might put a flexible plastic tube into the fluid to drain the infection. This tube might stay in for a few days.</p><p>If you have cancer and get fluid around your lungs, your doctor might put a flexible plastic tube in the side of your chest to drain away the extra fluid. Your doctor might leave the tube in for a few weeks and you will drain the fluid at home. You might also need chemotherapy to treat the cancer and prevent the fluid from coming back.</p><p>You also might need surgery to remove a small sample of tissue from around your lungs. This is called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; Tests on this tissue can help explain why you have the effusion. At the time of surgery, the doctor might use a powdery substance called &quot;talc&quot; to close the space and keep the fluid from returning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662463\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleuritic-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pleuritic chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracentesis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Thoracentesis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
