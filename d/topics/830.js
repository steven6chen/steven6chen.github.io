The anus is the last part of the digestive tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>), where bowel movements leave the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433186\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of anal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal cancer does not always cause symptoms at first. People who do have symptoms can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from their anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in or around their anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A growth in their anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching in their anus</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433201\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for anal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for anal cancer, your doctor or nurse will look at your anus and do a &quot;digital rectal exam.&quot; During a digital rectal exam, your doctor or nurse will put a gloved finger into your anus and lower rectum to feel for abnormal growths.</p><p>He or she might do 1 or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anoscopy &ndash; During an anoscopy, the doctor puts a short tube with a light on the end (called an &quot;anoscope&quot;) into your anus and rectum. He or she will use the anoscope to look for abnormal areas or growths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; A doctor can remove a small sample of tissue from the anus. Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p/><p>Doctors sometimes find cells in the anus that are not cancer, but are abnormal and have a high chance of turning into cancer. Your doctor can treat these &quot;pre-cancer&quot; cells in different ways. He or she might remove them to help keep them from turning into cancer. Or he or she might watch them closely over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433216\"><span class=\"h1\">What is anal cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend on the stage of your anal cancer, and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433231\"><span class=\"h1\">How is anal cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with anal cancer are treated with both:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p>Anal cancer is sometimes treated with surgery to remove the cancer. But most people don't need surgery. People do not need surgery if their cancer gets better after chemotherapy and radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433246\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Regular follow-up tests include exams (including digital rectal exams) and anoscopy. Some people also have follow-up imaging tests. Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of your body.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean the cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433261\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back or spreads, you might need surgery or more chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433276\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for anal cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25433291\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
