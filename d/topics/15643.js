Doctors call this &quot;impotence&quot; or &quot;erectile dysfunction.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having little or no interest in sex. Doctors call this &quot;low libido.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ejaculating too soon after sex begins, before they are ready to ejaculate. Doctors call this &quot;premature ejaculation.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to ejaculate (even though they can get and keep an erection)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544483183\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes sex problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men can have trouble getting or keeping an erection if they have a condition that keeps the penis from getting enough blood. Things that reduce blood flow to the penis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking alcohol or taking drugs</p><p/><p>Sex problems can also occur when men feel depressed, worried, or have other things on their mind. Plus, sex problems can be a side effect of certain medicines. For example, medicines to treat depression or heart disease sometimes cause sex problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544483190\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can help figure out the cause of your problem. He or she will talk with you, do an exam, and order blood tests. He or she might also order another test, such as a test that measures your night-time erections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544483197\"><span class=\"h1\">How are sex problems treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of the problem and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines to help you get and keep an erection</strong> &ndash; Examples of these medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sildenafil</a> (sample brand name: Viagra), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vardenafil</a> (sample brand name: Levitra), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tadalafil</a> (sample brand name: Cialis), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avanafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">avanafil</a> (sample brand name: Stendra). Follow your doctor's instructions closely when taking these medicines. Also, let your doctor know if you are taking any other medicines. Men who take certain medicines should <strong>not</strong> take medicines to get an erection. Examples include &quot;nitrates&quot; that are used to treat heart problems, and certain &quot;alpha blockers&quot; that are used to treat an enlarged prostate gland.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some medicines for treating sex problems are sold over the internet. However, these are not always safe, and they can even contain harmful ingredients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Devices to help you get and keep an erection</strong> &ndash; Erection devices work in different ways. Some are implanted into the penis to form an erection. Others work a bit like a vacuum and help pull blood into the penis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormone treatment</strong> &ndash; Sex problems can happen when a man's body does not make enough male hormones (testosterone). If your hormone levels are very low, your doctor might treat you with testosterone, which can come in a shot, skin patch, skin gel, or tablet that sticks to your gums.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment to improve mood</strong> &ndash; Doctors might prescribe medicines or counseling for men who feel depressed or worried.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatments to delay ejaculation</strong> &ndash; Doctors can prescribe medicines to keep men from ejaculating too quickly. Some of the medicines used to treat depression work very well for this. Some men also use a method called &quot;pause and squeeze.&quot; In this method, a man stops having sex and presses behind the tip of the penis when he feels like he is going to ejaculate. After the feeling goes away, he continues having sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment to help ejaculation problems caused by depression medicines</strong> &ndash; Sometimes, medicines used to treat depression can make it hard or impossible for a man to ejaculate. Let your doctor know if this happens. He or she can change your dose or your medicine so the problem gets better.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H544483204\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Priapism (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-as-you-get-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex as you get older (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgen-replacement-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Androgen replacement in men (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
