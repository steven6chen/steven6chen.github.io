It is considered separately from the non-IgM MGUS because it has the potential to progress to smoldering Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia and to symptomatic Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia and less often to lymphoma or AL amyloidosis.

The mean age at diagnosis is 70 years, and less than 2 percent of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The incidence and prevalence rises with patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>], is higher in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and is two- to threefold higher in Africans and African Americans compared with Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of MGUS in men is estimated to be 120 per 100,000 at age 50 and increases to 530 per 100,000 by the age of 90. The corresponding rates for women are 60 per 100,000 population at age 50, and 370 per 100,000 at age 90 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The best estimates of prevalence come from population-based studies of a geographically defined area during a specific time period. Factors that influence the findings of such studies include demographic features of the screened population (ie, age, sex, race), the presence of risk factors for MGUS in the population (eg, occupational and environmental risk factors, immune status, and familial risk), and logistical features of the study (eg, how the study identified populations to screen, the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests used, and the diagnostic criteria used) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The prevalence of MGUS among a well-defined, largely Caucasian population was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by immunofixation in 21,463 of the 28,038 enumerated residents (77 percent) of Olmsted County, Minnesota who were &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of MGUS in persons &ge;50, &ge;70, and &ge;85 years of age was 3.2, 5.3, and 7.5 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age-adjusted rates for persons &ge;50 were significantly higher in men than in women (4.0 versus 2.7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation noted the prevalence of light chain-MGUS and MGUS in persons over age 50 was 0.8 and 3.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p>Many studies have demonstrated the effects of race on MGUS frequency. A study from Ghana used stratified random sampling to estimate the incidence of MGUS in black men from western Africa at twice that of the white population from Minnesota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A two- to threefold higher frequency in MGUS among American blacks was also seen in a large study of inpatients from US Veterans Affairs hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and a large population-based study of Southern women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The latter study also showed that the increased risk of MGUS seen in African Americans persists in a cohort of women of similar socio-economic status. These and other studies suggest that the racial predisposition to MGUS and multiple myeloma observed in blacks is likely related to shared genetics, rather than environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].</p><p>There is a paucity of information regarding the incidence in other races. A study in adult Asians from Japan that used an older method for screening suggests that Japanese persons may have a slightly lower incidence than that seen in Caucasians from Minnesota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The limited data available also suggest that the prevalence of MGUS in Mexicans is less than in Caucasians from Minnesota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most cases of MGUS appear to be sporadic, relatives of persons with MGUS have an increased risk of developing MGUS and related diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

As an example, a population-based prevalence study of 21,463 persons from Olmsted County, Minnesota estimated that more than half of men and women diagnosed with MGUS at age 70 years had had a monoclonal protein for at least 10 years, and that approximately one-quarter had had a monoclonal protein for 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90177423\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MGUS (non-IgM and IgM) is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal (M) protein produced and secreted by clonal plasma cells, which can be detected by protein electrophoresis of the serum (SPEP) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of an aliquot of urine (UPEP) from a 24-hour collection combined with immunofixation of the serum and urine.

A subset of patients with MGUS will progress to smoldering (asymptomatic) MM and then to symptomatic MM. It is impossible to differentiate MGUS from those who subsequently develop smoldering or symptomatic MM at the time of initial presentation.</p><p>By definition, any patient with a non IgM serum monoclonal protein &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or with &ge;10 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow does <strong>not</strong> have MGUS. In such a case, a diagnosis of MM or smoldering MM (SMM) should be made based upon the presence or absence of symptoms. The morphologic appearance of the plasma cells in the bone marrow is of little help unless the cells have plasmablastic morphologic features (eg, nucleoli), which favors the diagnosis of MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, due to patchy bone marrow involvement, approximately 4 percent of patients with MM will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy demonstrating less than 10 percent clonal plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>While the diagnosis of MGUS requires the absence of anemia, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and lytic bone lesions related to the plasma cell proliferative disorder, the mere presence of one or more of these features in conjunction with an M protein does not automatically indicate MM or related malignancy, since these abnormalities may be due to unrelated coexisting diseases. As an example, patients with MGUS may have anemia related to nutritional deficiency; renal failure related to coexisting diabetes or hypertension; hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism; or lytic bone lesions from metastatic carcinoma. Only patients in whom these clinical findings of end organ damage are felt to be clearly related to the plasma cell disorder are considered to have MM.
