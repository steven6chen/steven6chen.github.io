In children, these tumors are often referred to as germinomas and nongerminomas. For a tumor to be considered a seminoma, dysgerminoma, or germinoma, it must consist entirely of that single histology and cannot contain other GCT elements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nonseminomatous tumors, including nondysgerminomas and nongerminomas, include yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas, teratomas, and mixed tumors that contain more than one cell line.

In adults, immature teratomas of the mediastinum can be aggressive tumors, similar to other nonseminomas, and have a poor prognosis, whereas in prepubertal children, immature elements in a teratoma are not associated with malignant behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Two competing hypotheses have been proposed, but there are inadequate data to determine which, if either, is correct.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first hypothesis is that extragonadal GCTs are derived from primordial germ cells that fail to complete the normal migration along the urogenital ridge to the gonadal ridges during embryonal development. This may be due to an abnormality in the primordial germ cell itself or in its microenvironment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second hypothesis is that germ cells transformed in the testes undergo reverse migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by genetic data suggesting that extragonadal GCTs and testicular GCTs share a common cell of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, this hypothesis does not explain the biological differences seen in mediastinal nonseminomatous GCTs compared with nonseminomatous GCTs occurring in the testes or retroperitoneum. Such differences include the poorer prognosis and the greater incidence of yolk sac tumor elements and leukemia in patients with mediastinal primaries and might result from differences either in the cell of origin or in the tumor's microenvironment.</p><p/><p>The following observations may be relevant to the pathogenesis of extragonadal GCTs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular carcinoma in situ, the precursor of testicular GCTs, is found in up to 50 percent of the testes of men with retroperitoneal GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, testicular biopsy is not generally indicated in the absence of evidence of a tumor on ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Germ cell tumors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157771\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two key issues in establishing the diagnosis are the exclusion of metastasis from a primary testicular GCT and distinguishing an extragonadal nonseminomatous GCT from another type of poorly differentiated cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular palpation is not sufficient to exclude a primary testicular GCT; ultrasonography should be performed in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It may be difficult to distinguish true extragonadal GCTs from metastatic tumors in which the primary gonadal lesion has regressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Primary mediastinal GCTs occur in the anterior mediastinum, whereas testicular GCTs rarely metastasize to the anterior mediastinum, so a tumor there is unlikely to be a metastasis from a testicular primary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, extragonadal GCTs can be clearly distinguished from a poorly differentiated carcinoma based upon histopathologic evaluation. In cases where the histopathologic diagnosis is no more specific than poorly differentiated carcinoma, the question arises whether to treat the cancer as a GCT. A key issue in such cases is confirming that the neoplasm is a carcinoma and not a hematologic malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Poorly differentiated carcinomas with a primarily midline distribution sometimes respond dramatically to chemotherapy, similarly to GCTs. Moreover, GCTs are the only carcinomas that present in this way that are likely to be cured with chemotherapy. Therefore, a poorly differentiated carcinoma of the retroperitoneum or anterior mediastinum should generally be treated as a GCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although it is commonly done, it is not clear that measuring serum tumor markers is of any utility in this scenario because GCT chemotherapy should be administered regardless of serum tumor marker levels, and serum tumor marker elevation is not associated with a better outcome following such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of cytogenetic analysis for extra copies of chromosome arm 12p is also of limited value. Although such a finding is highly specific for a diagnosis of GCT, identification of this chromosomal abnormality has not been shown to improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extragonadal nonseminomatous GCTs are often associated with elevations in serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). AFP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta-hCG is elevated in 85 percent of cases of extragonadal nonseminomatous GCTs.
