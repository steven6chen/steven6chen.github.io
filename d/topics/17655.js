Full control of the disease and the repair of damaged myelin are key objectives for current and future investigators.</p><p>The treatment of acute exacerbations of MS is reviewed here. Other aspects of MS treatment are discussed separately.

Indications for glucocorticoid treatment of an acute attack (eg, relapse, exacerbation, flare) in patients with MS include functionally disabling symptoms with objective evidence of neurologic impairment such as loss of vision, diplopia weakness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebellar symptoms. Mild sensory attacks often are not treated, although symptomatic relief is sometimes necessary because of patient discomfort (eg, due to paresthesia).</p><p>Most patients with a suspected attack should be evaluated with an MRI of the brain or spinal cord, which will typically show a new lesion that enhances with the administration of gadolinium. This finding can help distinguish an attack from a &quot;pseudo-relapse,&quot; the temporary worsening of existing MS symptoms in the setting of heat exposure or infection. However, an MRI is not obligatory if the clinical suspicion for an MS relapse is high or if the relapse is mild (eg, sensory only).</p><p>The goal of treatment is to speed recovery time from the attack. However, acute treatment has no apparent benefit for improving the long-term impact of recovery from an attack or reducing the risk of subsequent attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>MS relapses may lead to residual, permanent disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with relapsing-remitting MS who manifest current disease activity by either clinical symptoms or recent MRI lesions should be offered treatment with disease-modifying therapy.

An alternative is a three to seven day course of oral prednisone, 625 to 1250 mg daily, with or without a short taper. Oral dosing requires many tablets (eg, up to 20 tablets daily of prednisone 50 mg tablets to reach a dose of 1000 mg) but some patients prefer oral therapy rather than intravenous therapy, as the latter requires an intravenous line and sitting still for a few hours while the dose is infused.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2000 identified six randomized controlled trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) with placebo in a total of 377 patients with acute exacerbations of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The clinical significance of the peak concentration for efficacy is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the beneficial effects of oral glucocorticoids for acute MS attacks discussed above, some clinicians prefer to use intravenous glucocorticoids (with or without an oral taper) because of evidence from one trial that low-dose, oral glucocorticoid treatment is associated with an increased risk of recurrent optic neuritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, oral glucocorticoids are still widely used for MS exacerbations (other than those associated with optic neuritis) because, in spite of the empirical evidence, there is little theoretical rationale for oral glucocorticoids to worsen MS.</p><p>We recommend treatment with glucocorticoids for patients with an acute MS exacerbation that results in neurologic symptoms and increased disability or impairments in vision, strength, or cerebellar function. Our preferred regimen is intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1000 mg daily for five days without an oral taper.</p><p>As an alternative, repository <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticotropin-injection-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">corticotropin injection gel</a>, a purified form of bovine or porcine adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), is available in the United States (as HP Acthar Gel) and several other countries. It can be used for patients with MS exacerbations who cannot tolerate high-dose glucocorticoids or have poor venous access or prefer self-injection. Various dosing schedules have been used in trials and in clinical practice for adults with acute MS exacerbations, generally starting corticotropin at 80 to 120 units daily administered by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SQ) injection for one week and continuing with or without a taper for a total of two to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When high-dose glucocorticoids are not a good option, we suggest using corticotropin 80 units daily for one week followed by a tapering schedule over a second week (eg, 80 units for seven days, 40 units for four days, and 20 units for three days). The IM and SQ administration of corticotropin appear to be bio-equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, corticotropin injection gel is much more expensive (nearly USD $30,000) than equivalent doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.</p><p>Before starting glucocorticoid or ACTH therapy, acute infection (particularly of the urinary tract) should be ruled out, since glucocorticoids are immunosuppressive and may exacerbate infection.</p><p>In general, oral glucocorticoid therapy should not be offered to patients with acute optic neuritis; intravenous therapy is recommended instead. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term high-dose intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is associated with relatively few side effects in most patients, although mental status changes, increased susceptibility to infection, and gastric disturbance are potential complications. Psychiatric side effects can include increased depressive, manic, and hypomanic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. To mitigate these side effects, we suggest the prophylactic use of a proton pump inhibitor in the morning and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> at night while on glucocorticoid treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus may need to be hospitalized to monitor glucose levels.</p><p>An increased incidence of fractures has been reported in patients undergoing repeated glucocorticoid therapy; baseline and yearly bone density scans are recommended for these individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'General measures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PLASMA EXCHANGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma exchange may be beneficial in patients with acute central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory demyelinating disease who do not respond to glucocorticoid therapy. In the only formally reported clinical trial, 22 patients with CNS demyelinating disease (12 with MS) were randomly assigned to either active plasma exchange or sham treatment, with a total of seven treatments, given every two days over 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Moderate or greater improvement in neurologic disability occurred during 8 of 19 (42 percent) courses of active treatment compared with 1 of 17 (6 percent) courses of sham treatment. Improvement occurred early in the course of treatment and was sustained on follow-up. However, four of the patients who responded to the active treatment experienced new attacks of demyelination during six months of follow-up. In an earlier randomized controlled trial of 116 patients with MS, a subgroup analysis of patients with relapsing forms of MS showed that plasma exchange led to faster improvement in disease exacerbations than sham plasma exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Based mainly upon the results of this trial, guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology state that plasmapheresis should be considered for the adjunctive treatment of exacerbations in patients with relapsing forms of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Nonrandomized studies have suggested benefit as well. In a series of 90 patients with MS or a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS who had acute relapses, a clinical response to plasma exchange was observed in 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI before treatment best predicted response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In experienced centers, complications from plasma exchange are uncommon and generally mild, though rarely patients may experience potentially severe complications such as anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given these data, we suggest treatment with plasma exchange for patients with acute, severe neurologic deficits caused by MS attacks who have a poor response to treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids.</p><p>A small retrospective study found that patients with antibody and complement-associated CNS demyelination, demonstrated by biopsy or autopsy, were significantly more likely to benefit from plasma exchange treatment than those with other patterns of demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-exacerbations-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These results suggest that pathologic differences in MS lesions play a role in the response to plasma exchange, but this finding needs confirmation in larger prospective studies. The utility of this approach is further limited by the need to obtain brain biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
