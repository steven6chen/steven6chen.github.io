These and other metabolic changes ensure that the fetus has an ample supply of nutrients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-endocrine-and-metabolic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Endocrine and metabolic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus develops during pregnancy in women whose pancreatic function is insufficient to overcome the insulin resistance associated with the pregnant state. Among the main consequences are increased risks of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and cesarean delivery, and their associated morbidities.</p><p>The approach to screening for and diagnosis of diabetes in pregnant women will be reviewed here. Management and prognosis are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational diabetes mellitus: Glycemic control and maternal prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational diabetes mellitus: Obstetrical issues and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H132644621\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology for describing diabetes first diagnosed during pregnancy varies among national organizations. Historically, the term &quot;gestational diabetes&quot; has been defined as onset or first recognition of abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In recent years, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups, the American Diabetes Association, the World Health Organization, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and others have attempted to distinguish women with probable preexisting diabetes that is first recognized during pregnancy from those whose disease is a transient manifestation of pregnancy-related insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. This change acknowledges the increasing prevalence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant women of childbearing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These organizations typically use the term &quot;gestational diabetes&quot; to describe diabetes diagnosed during the second half of pregnancy, and terms such as &quot;overt diabetes&quot; or &quot;diabetes mellitus in pregnancy&quot; to describe diabetes diagnosed by standard nonpregnant criteria early in pregnancy, when the effects of insulin resistance are less prominent. The term &quot;gestational diabetes&quot; has also been used to describe glucose levels in early pregnancy that do not meet standard nonpregnant criteria for overt diabetes but are diagnostic for gestational diabetes mellitus. One shortcoming of this approach is that the diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus have not been validated for early pregnancy, and were based on data from the late second and early third trimester.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473902738\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1819068\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus as traditionally defined is approximately 6 to 7 percent in the United States (range 1 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The prevalence varies worldwide and among racial and ethnic groups, generally in parallel with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. In the United States, prevalence rates are higher in African American, Hispanic American, Native American, Pacific Islander, and South or East Asian women than in white women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Prevalence also varies because of differences in screening practices, population characteristics (eg, average age and body mass index [BMI] of pregnant women), testing method, and diagnostic criteria. Prevalence has been increasing over time, possibly due to increases in mean maternal age and weight, particularly increasing obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>].</p><p>In 2010, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups proposed new screening and diagnostic criteria for diabetes in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Using these criteria, the global prevalence of hyperglycemia in pregnancy has been estimated at 17 percent, with regional estimates varying between 10 percent in North America and 25 percent in Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated that although a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus generally requires that two or more glucose thresholds must be met or exceeded, some clinicians may choose to make the diagnosis based on one elevated value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It would be anticipated that if, as the new ACOG bulletin suggests, a single elevated value on the three-hour 100-gram oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) is used to diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus, the prevalence will increase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several adverse outcomes have been associated with diabetes during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydramnios</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrosomia and large for gestational age infant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal organomegaly (hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal and infant birth trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perinatal mortality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal respiratory problems and metabolic complications (hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, erythremia)</p><p/><p>Importantly, the risks of these outcomes increase as maternal fasting plasma glucose levels increase above 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and as the one-hour and two-hour oral GTT values increase from the lowest septile to the highest. This is a continuous effect; there is no clear threshold that defines patients at increased risk of adverse obstetrical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,30</a>].</p><p>In addition, if the mother is hyperglycemic during organogenesis, such as women with known or unknown overt diabetes, the risks of miscarriage and congenital anomalies are increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes: Preconception counseling, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Long-term, women with gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes as well as type 1 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-diabetes-mellitus-glycemic-control-and-maternal-prognosis#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational diabetes mellitus: Glycemic control and maternal prognosis&quot;, section on 'Long-term risk'</a>). Their adolescent and adult offspring are also at risk of long-term sequelae, such as obesity, abnormal glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31,32</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-of-a-diabetic-mother#H713834\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant of a diabetic mother&quot;, section on 'Long-term outcome'</a>). Gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and the combination of obesity and diabetes (gestational or pregestational) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] have been associated with an increased risk of autism in offspring, but it is not clear that these associations are causal.

Few studies have evaluated long-term effects of maternal treatment on offspring. In one long-term study of treated versus untreated pregnancies with mild gestational diabetes mellitus (defined as fasting plasma glucose &lt;95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> but two elevated 100-gram, three-hour oral GTT values), treatment during pregnancy did not reduce late adverse metabolic outcomes (eg, obesity, glucose intolerance) among 5- to 10-year-old offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This may reflect lack of a true treatment effect, inadequate treatment of hyperglycemia during pregnancy, the mildness of the glucose intolerance, or inadequate power to show modest differences in outcome because of the low prevalence of these diseases in children at this age (prior to puberty), and the small numbers of study participants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with any of the following characteristics appear to be at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus; the risk increases when multiple risk factors are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal history of impaired glucose tolerance or gestational diabetes mellitus in a previous pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Member of one of the following ethnic groups, which have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes: Hispanic American, African American, Native American, South or East Asian, Pacific Islander.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of diabetes, especially in first-degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepregnancy weight &ge;110 percent of ideal body weight or BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> significant weight gain in early adulthood and between pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], or excessive gestational weight gain during the first 18 to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal age &gt;25 years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous unexplained perinatal loss or birth of a malformed infant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycosuria at the first prenatal visit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical <span class=\"nowrap\">condition/setting</span> associated with development of diabetes, such as metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, current use of glucocorticoids, hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple gestation.</p><p/><p>Women at low risk of gestational diabetes mellitus are younger (&lt;25 years of age), non-Hispanic white, with normal BMI (&lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> no history of previous glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, and no first-degree relative with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Women who gained 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or more between pregnancies significantly increased their risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05-2.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a study that compared the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus in 346 women who delivered before bariatric surgery with the incidence in 354 women who delivered after bariatric surgery, the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus was lower after bariatric surgery (8 versus 27 percent, odds ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.15-0.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Bariatric surgery also induces hormonal changes that may lower the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus independent of weight loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prepregnancy and early pregnancy exercise</strong> &ndash; In nonpregnant women, regular moderate exercise lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with being sedentary (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H2741514022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>). Whether exercise alone or in combination with diet lowers the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus is unclear, as meta-analyses of randomized trials have reported conflicting findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. Overweight and obese women seem to benefit most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The types and durations of the exercise programs in these trials have varied and may account for the discordancies. In particular, beginning a modest exercise program in midpregnancy appears to be inadequate to impact risk of gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/48,49,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49,54</a>]. Exercise should be started before pregnancy or soon thereafter, performed three to four times per week for 30- to 60-minute sessions, and continued until delivery (and ideally thereafter for general health benefits). In one trial in which overweight and obese pregnant women participated in this type of exercise program, the&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;group had a significantly lower incidence of&nbsp;gestational&nbsp;diabetes mellitus&nbsp;(22.0 percent versus 40.6 percent with usual care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Few studies on the role of dietary factors in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus have been performed. There is limited evidence (none from randomized trials) that a diet favoring fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and fish and low in red and processed meat, refined grains, and high-fat dairy reduces the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. There is low-quality evidence from randomized trials that advising women about a low-glycemic-index diet does not prevent development of gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a healthy diet can promote weight loss before pregnancy and reduce excessive weight gain during pregnancy, which is beneficial in overweight and obese women. Smoking cessation should be encouraged in all patients, and may reduce gestational diabetes mellitus risk.

Meta-analyses of randomized trials of antenatal myo-inositol supplementation during pregnancy suggest a reduction in the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus, but the trials were of low quality and included less than 600 participants in total [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. A subsequent randomized trial in which 240 women with a family history of diabetes were assigned to a daily combination of myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> versus folic acid alone at their first prenatal visit found no difference in gestational diabetes mellitus between the two treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Before this intervention can be recommended, large multicenter, blinded, randomized trials are needed to confirm safety and demonstrate improvement in clinically important maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1818482\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS AND HARMS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening and diagnostic testing for diabetes are performed because identifying pregnant women with diabetes followed by appropriate therapy can decrease fetal and maternal morbidity, particularly macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and preeclampsia.

However, some women find the hyperosmolar drinks difficult to tolerate. If gestational diabetes mellitus is diagnosed, management involves changes in diet, an increased frequency of prenatal visits, blood glucose monitoring, possible pharmacologic therapy, and additional maternal and fetal monitoring.</p><p>The cost implications of screening versus not screening have been modeled, and screening appears to be cost-effective for prevention of type 2 diabetes in populations with a high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes, provided that lifestyle interventions are applied subsequent to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of screening is to identify asymptomatic individuals with a high probability of having or developing a specific disease. Screening is usually performed as a two-step process where step one identifies individuals at increased risk for the disease so that step two, diagnostic testing, which is definitive but usually more complicated or costly than the screening test, can be limited to these individuals and avoided in low-risk individuals. Alternatively, a diagnostic test can be administered to all individuals, which is a one-step process. A 2017 Cochrane review concluded available evidence was of low quality and insufficient to determine the best strategy for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394519025\"><span class=\"h2\">One-step and two-step approaches</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Two-step approach</strong> &ndash; The two-step approach is the most widely used approach for identifying pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus in the United States.

In a study from 15 Chinese hospitals, if performance of the GTT was restricted to women with fasting glucose from 79 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> then 50 percent of pregnant women could avoid a GTT since 38 percent of this population had fasting glucose &lt;79 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and 12 percent had fasting glucose &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> diagnostic of gestational diabetes mellitus in this system; 12 percent of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus were missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Thus, only 50 of 64 (78 percent) had reproducible test results. Nevertheless, it is a practical and widely utilized means of diagnosing both gestational diabetes mellitus and diabetes in non-pregnant individuals.</p><p>The GTT can be performed as a 75-gram two-hour test or a 100-gram three-hour test; there is no consensus regarding the optimum thresholds for a positive test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F93261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93261 \">table 1</a>). Although the 100-gram three-hour GTT is typically performed as the second step of the two-step approach while the 75-gram two-hour test is performed as the only test in the one-step approach, this is arbitrary. In fact, the Canadian Diabetes Association clinical guidelines suggest the 75-gram two-hour GTT as the second step of the two-step approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

If a 100-gram three-hour GTT is planned, no data support a particular fasting cutoff for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus and an abnormal fasting glucose level alone is not diagnostic of gestational diabetes mellitus. However, a glucose level &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is a reasonable threshold for cancelling the GTT as it is diagnostic of diabetes in the general population. This approach requires asking the patient to have blood drawn for her fasting glucose level and then wait for the results before proceeding with the GTT later on the same day (and remain fasting) or on another day (and fast again), which is cumbersome.</p><p>As discussed above, it is not necessary to exclude fasting hyperglycemia to safely perform the test.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not endorsed one diagnostic criteria over the other because comparative trials have not been performed.</p><p>The requirement for two abnormal values on the GTT was an arbitrary decision made by O'Sullivan and Mahan in 1964 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. A 2016 systematic review including 25 studies noted that women with one abnormal value on the three-hour, 100-gram oral GTT generally had increased risks for the same poor outcomes as women with two abnormal values (ie, gestational diabetes mellitus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Citing this systematic review, the 2017 ACOG practice bulletin on gestational diabetes mellitus stated that although a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus generally requires that two or more glucose thresholds must be met or exceeded, some clinicians may choose to make the diagnosis based on one elevated value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

These thresholds represent the glucose values at which the odds of infant birth weight, cord C-peptide (proxy for fetal insulin level), and neonatal percent body fat &gt;90<sup>th</sup> percentile were 1.75 times the estimated odds of these outcomes at mean glucose levels, based on fully adjusted logistic regression models. Compared with women in the HAPO study with all glucose values below the thresholds, women who exceeded one or more of these thresholds had a twofold higher frequency of large for gestational age infants and preeclampsia and &gt;45 percent increase in preterm delivery and primary cesarean delivery. Using an odds ratio of 2 for the thresholds defined a population with a higher frequency of these outcomes, but the difference was modest and resulted in failure to identify many women who were at almost comparable risk.

class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61853 \">table 4</a>). Given the increasing frequency of type 2 diabetes, she believes early testing when routine initial prenatal laboratory tests are drawn is both desirable and convenient, and that diagnosis of these patients combined with appropriate management will improve pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"#H360154383\" class=\"local\">'Identification of overt diabetes in early pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p>The author acknowledges that A1C is not a suitable test to detect mildly impaired glucose tolerance. In men and nonpregnant women, an A1C &ge;6.5 percent (&ge;48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> is one of the criteria used to diagnose diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61853\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61853 \">table 4</a>). Therefore, an A1C &ge;6.5 percent early in pregnancy, when A1C levels are generally slightly lower than in the nonpregnant state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>], suggests previously undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. However, an A1C below 6.5 percent cannot be taken as strong evidence against the diagnosis of diabetes, especially in pregnant women with A1C above the upper limit of the normal range.</p><p>Early in pregnancy, the author uses American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diagnosis of overt diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61853\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61853 \">table 4</a>). Neither ACOG criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78433\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78433 \">table 5</a>) nor International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups <span class=\"nowrap\">(IADPSG)/ADA</span> criteria for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus at 24 to 28 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61208 \">table 3</a>) have been validated in the first or early second trimester.</p><p>Of note, approximately one-quarter of women with A1C 5.7 to 6.4 percent ([39 to 46 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol]</span> suggestive of impaired glucose intolerance) in early pregnancy develop gestational diabetes mellitus when screened and tested later in pregnancy compared with &lt;10 percent of those with A1C &lt;5.7 percent (39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2592336311\"><span class=\"h2\">At 24 to 28 weeks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who have not been previously diagnosed with diabetes, we prefer a two-step testing approach at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, following the American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines (50-gram oral glucose challenge test followed by the 100-gram three-hour oral glucose tolerance test [GTT] in screen-positive women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although the one-step 75-gram two-hour oral GTT using the IADPSG thresholds identifies pregnancies at risk for higher infant birth weight, cord C-peptide level, and neonatal percent body fat &gt;90<sup>th</sup> percentile, it is uncertain whether treatment of glucose intolerance below current glucose thresholds endorsed by ACOG improve perinatal outcomes. Screening with a glucose challenge has the practical advantage that it can be performed at any time of day, without dietary preparation, while the one-step approach requires that all patients undergo an overnight fast prior to laboratory testing and must be done in the morning. Only a small percentage of women need to undergo the second test of the two-step approach, which involves an additional laboratory visit and collection of four additional blood draws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p>By the IADPSG estimate, 18 percent of all pregnant women would be diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus using the one-step approach since it omits the screening 50-gram glucose challenge, requires only a single elevated value, and has slightly lower thresholds for a positive test than the 100-gram three-hour oral GTT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61208 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80677 \">table 2</a>). ACOG and others recommend against adoption of the one-step approach and criteria because it would increase the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, leading to more frequent prenatal visits, more fetal and maternal surveillance, and more interventions, including induction of labor, without clear demonstration of improvements in the most clinically important health- and patient-centered outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>]. Two randomized trials of mild gestational diabetes mellitus (using various criteria for diagnosis) have shown a reduction of macrosomia, preeclampsia, and shoulder dystocia with treatment of mild gestational diabetes mellitus. However, neither of these studies used the IADPSG-proposed criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Although the increased diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus would offer challenges in use of resources and improving the efficiency of health care delivery for this condition, it is not clear that increased identification of patients with mild gestational diabetes mellitus would require the same intensity of glucose monitoring, fetal testing, and intervention as those with gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed by more stringent criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Increasing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus without proven benefit can also have untoward effects on women's perception of their overall health. One prospective survey showed that women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus were less likely to report their health status favorably and more likely to have lower health perceptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. On the other hand, in one randomized trial, a subgroup of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus assigned to the intervention arm had lower rates of depression and reported improved health-related quality of life at three months postpartum compared with women assigned to routine obstetrical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>While more research is necessary, several retrospective studies that compared pregnancy outcome with one-step versus two-step testing found that the one-step approach identified more women at increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/126-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">126-131</a>]. For example, in a prospective study in which the two-step approach was replaced by the one-step approach, the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus increased 3.5-fold, pregnancy outcomes improved significantly, and the change was cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. Another &quot;before-and-after&quot; study reported a 2.25-fold increase in prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, with a concomitant fall in rates of cesarean delivery, fetal macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycemia in the overall population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Available data are not all consistent, as one study reported that use of the one-step approach increased both the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (1.6-fold in a very high-prevalence population) and the cesarean delivery rate, but did not decrease the rate of large for gestational age or macrosomic neonates or improve maternal or neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Another smaller study reported a fourfold increase in gestational diabetes mellitus with non-statistical decreases in cesarean delivery and large for gestational age newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. These studies are limited by small sample size and lack of a head-to-head comparison of perinatal outcomes of women diagnosed with glucose intolerance based on the one-step versus two-step method. Further investigation is warranted as to whether treatment of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus using the IADPSG criteria improves perinatal outcomes.</p><p>In a Canadian trial, the cost of the test alone was lower with the two-step approach (CAN $89.03 for a one-hour 50-gram glucose screen plus three-hour 100-gram GTT when indicated versus CAN $108.38 when only a two-hour 75-gram GTT was performed); this study was unusual because the prevalence of diabetes was low and similar in both groups (3.7 and 3.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. A modeling study of the one-step paradigm for diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus found it to be cost-effective in the United States when postpartum interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes are initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. There is also some evidence that it is cost-effective in improving maternal and neonatal outcomes, even when postpartum interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes are not included in cost-effectiveness analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69781273\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
