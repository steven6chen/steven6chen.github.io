It happens to people when they are on a boat, in a car, on a carnival ride, or in some other situation in which something is moving them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18610612\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of motion sickness?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making more saliva than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warmth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18610627\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You might feel better if you keep your eyes on the outside world while you are in motion. For example, if you are in a car, sit in the front and look in the direction you are moving; if you are on a boat, stay on the deck and look to the horizon. This helps make what you see match the movement you are feeling, and so you are less likely to feel sick.</p><p>You should also avoid reading, watching a movie, or looking at things close to you inside the vehicle you are riding in.</p><p>Sometimes, lying on your back can ease motion sickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18610642\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you know you get motion sickness and you need to be on a boat or in a car, see your doctor or nurse. He or she can help you figure out how to manage your problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18610657\"><span class=\"h1\">How is motion sickness treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of medicines that can help prevent and treat motion sickness.
