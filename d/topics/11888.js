The two factors that are most important in determining a patient's prognosis and potential treatment options are the tumor mass and the patient's hepatic reserve. A patient with a solitary tumor &lt;5 cm in diameter and well-preserved hepatic function has an excellent long-term prognosis given the therapeutic options now available. In contrast, patients with multifocal disease and marginal hepatic function have a worse prognosis, and treatment options can be quite limited.</p><p>Treatment options are divided into surgical therapies (ie, resection and orthotopic liver transplantation [OLT]) and nonsurgical therapies (ie, radiofrequency ablation [RFA] and other thermal methods of tumor ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI], cryoablation, transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], radiation therapy [RT], radioembolization, and systemic therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic review will cover transarterial embolization, including radioembolization, and external beam RT. Other nonsurgical therapies (RFA, PEI, cryoablation, microwave and laser coagulation) are discussed elsewhere, as are resection, liver transplantation, and systemic therapy for HCC.

An alternative treatment algorithm is used by the Barcelona group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69566\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69566 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, attempts to generate algorithmic approaches to the treatment of HCC are difficult since new treatments and indications for various treatments are evolving rapidly. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches tend to vary based upon underlying liver function, available expertise, as well as variability in the criteria for hepatic resection and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With regard to patients who have a single HCC 5 cm or less in diameter and who are not candidates for surgical resection or OLT, the choice of nonsurgical treatment modality is empiric and influenced by local expertise, institutional practice, and location of the lesion. Few trials have directly compared any of the available therapies with one another, and there is little consensus as to when one modality should be chosen over another. Each of these modalities should be employed only in patients in whom liver function is relatively well preserved and in whom there is no extrahepatic tumor spread, vascular invasion, or main portal vein thrombus.</p><p>In general, hepatic transarterial embolization is reserved for treatment of an unresectable HCC that is either too large or multifocal for percutaneous ablation techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or stereotactic radiotherapy. Transarterial embolization may also be preferred if the location of the lesion makes percutaneous ablation impractical (eg, up against a major vessel, in the dome of the liver). Transarterial embolization is frequently used as a &quot;bridge&quot; to maintain liver transplant eligibility when waiting times for liver transplantation are long.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457341302\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wide variety of treatments for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are offered by different specialties: surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and interventional radiology. Accordingly, multidisciplinary evaluation and planning typically results in more thoroughly vetted recommendations and is less likely to result in a recommendation for a procedure for which a single provider has expertise but that may not represent the optimal therapy for an individual patient.</p><p>A majority of patients with HCC have underlying liver disease, which may be related to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis C virus (HCV). Furthermore, patients who undergo any of these forms of therapy are at high risk for recurrent disease and of progression to liver failure. It is important that patients with more-advanced liver disease have proper monitoring, assessment, and treatment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on longer term survival.</p><p>Comprehensive care of patients with cirrhosis includes antiviral therapy for HBV and HCV, immunization against hepatitis A and B (if indicated), regular surveillance for HCC with abdominal imaging, and endoscopic screening and surveillance for varices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1248650356\" class=\"local\">'Issues related to hepatitis B'</a> below.) </p><p>Prognostic scoring systems to assess the severity of underlying liver disease in patients undergoing treatment for HCC are discussed in detail elsewhere.

If there has been no recurrence of disease after a year, we then do the same imaging every six months. After two years with no evidence of disease recurrence, we revert back to standard HCC surveillance with ultrasound and AFP assay every six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma-and-recommendations-for-surveillance-in-adults-with-chronic-liver-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma and recommendations for surveillance in adults with chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>Nodular or thick areas of arterial enhancement along the margin of a treated HCC are consistent with residual tumor, especially when there is associated contrast washout. Issues related to assessment of tumor response in patients treated with locoregional ablation therapy for HCC are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-tumor-response-in-patients-receiving-systemic-and-nonsurgical-locoregional-treatment-of-hepatocellular-cancer#H610038069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of tumor response in patients receiving systemic and nonsurgical locoregional treatment of hepatocellular cancer&quot;, section on 'Follow-up imaging'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, all patients with underlying liver disease should be monitored and treated appropriately. It is also important that patients with more-advanced liver disease have proper monitoring for esophageal varices and assessment for treatment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on longer term survival. (See <a href=\"#H457341302\" class=\"local\">'Importance of multidisciplinary care'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248650293\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic arterial embolization is a reasonable option for patients with: an unresectable hepatocellular cancer (HCC) that is either too large or multifocal for percutaneous ablation techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA); relatively preserved liver function; and no extrahepatic tumor spread, vascular invasion, or tumor thrombosis involving the main portal vein. Patient selection is critical to the success and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The best candidates are patients with unresectable, encapsulated lesions without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, and preserved liver function (ie, Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 1</a>)).</p><p>Although the evidence from comparative trials is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], conventional TACE is the only method of transarterial treatment that has been shown to provide a survival advantage in randomized trials compared with supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. As a result, TACE, rather than bland embolization alone, is recommended in guidelines from an expert consensus group of the American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On the other hand, guidelines from both the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15589\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] recommend chemoembolization, bland embolization, or radioembolization in this setting, and neither group recommends any form of locoregional therapy over another. (See <a href=\"#H1248650419\" class=\"local\">'Radioembolization'</a> below.)</p><p>We do not routinely recommend TACE prior to a planned HCC resection. While it is commonly used as a bridging maneuver in patients awaiting liver transplantation, data proving benefit in the setting of partial hepatectomy are lacking, and moreover, some data suggest worse outcomes following TACE prior to planned resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Chemoembolization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance#H969401877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Prognosis, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, and posttreatment surveillance&quot;, section on 'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of the blood supply to an HCC is derived from the hepatic artery rather than the portal vein. This has led to the development of techniques designed to eliminate the tumor's blood supply by particle embolization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> directly infuse cytotoxic chemotherapy into the branch of the hepatic artery that feeds the tumor.</p><p>There is marked variability in the types of procedures that have been used for transarterial therapy: bland particle embolization, TACE without or with lipiodol, and transarterial chemotherapy alone or with lipiodol. Bland particle embolization, which relies solely on induction of tumor ischemia by disruption of the blood supply to the tumor, has been utilized successfully for the treatment of both unresectable and recurrent HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/4,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-11</a>]. Two meta-analyses have failed to show a significant survival difference between transarterial embolization and TACE, although there was a trend toward longer survival with TACE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The majority of published experience is with TACE, in which transarterial embolization is combined with the prior injection into the hepatic artery of chemotherapeutic agents, without or with lipiodol (which is sometimes called transarterial oily chemoembolization). This is the procedure that has been shown to improve survival in two randomized trials involving patients with unresectable HCC and as a result, is the most commonly used technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248650314\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TACE has been applied in the following settings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of unresectable HCC not suitable for local ablation either because of size, multiplicity, or location.

However, many tumors do not decrease in size even after successful treatment, forcing the use of surrogate markers of response (lack of contrast enhancement on computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], lipiodol deposition in targeted tumors, decline in alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) to determine the presence of tumor necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

In cases where there are multiple tumors in one lobe, a lobar chemoembolization may be needed. If there is disease involving both lobes, bilateral TACE must be performed sequentially.

During follow-up, residual tumor nests recover their blood supply and begin to regrow. This has prompted many centers to repeat the TACE procedure at regular intervals in an attempt to maximize benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The clinical relevance of this complication is unclear, although it has the potential to limit the ability to perform repeated procedures. Hepatic artery interruption by repeated TACE or arterial dissection also leads to the development of extrahepatic collateralization, which may create an alternative blood supply to the tumor and contribute to treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>TACE should be limited to the minimum number of procedures necessary to control the tumor. Unless we are using DEBs, we do not generally repeat the TACE procedure unless there is clear evidence of progressive tumor growth in the treated areas. The benefit of multiple repeated cycles of TACE must be weighed against the adverse effects of the procedure, particularly in those with cirrhosis and poor hepatic reserve.

Disease extent and the patient's hepatic reserve dictate the therapeutic options. (See <a href=\"#H361319942\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with HCC limited to the liver who are not candidates for surgical resection or liver transplantation, locoregional ablation therapies are preferable to systemic therapy for most patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nonsurgical methods of tumor ablation include radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and other forms of thermal ablation, transarterial embolization, including transarterial chemoembolization [TACE] and radioembolization, and external beam radiation therapy (RT; 3D conformal or stereotactic radiation). The choice of nonsurgical treatment modality is empiric and influenced by local expertise and institutional practice. Few trials have directly compared any of the available therapies with one another, and there is little consensus as to when one modality should be chosen over another. Patients with disease spread outside of the liver and those with major portal vein thrombosis are candidates for systemic therapy rather than liver-directed therapies, although patients with portal vein thrombus may benefit from radioembolization or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). (See <a href=\"#H2425297681\" class=\"local\">'Patients with portal vein thrombus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2425299089\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-radiofrequency-ablation-percutaneous-ethanol-injection-thermal-ablation-and-cryoablation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, thermal ablation, and cryoablation&quot;, section on 'Treatment algorithms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A majority of patients with HCC have underlying liver disease, which may be related to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis C virus (HCV). Furthermore, patients who undergo any of these forms of therapy are at high risk for recurrent disease and of progression to liver failure. It is important that all patients undergoing ablative therapy for HCC have proper monitoring and treatment of their underlying liver disease, which may have a major impact on longer-term survival. (See <a href=\"#H457341302\" class=\"local\">'Importance of multidisciplinary care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with large or multifocal primary unresectable HCCs that are not amenable to focal ablation, we suggest TACE rather than bland embolization alone, RT, or radioembolization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1248650321\" class=\"local\">'Primary treatment of unresectable or multifocal HCC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Where available, TACE using drug-eluting beads (DEBs) may be preferred over other techniques, although long-term experience with this modality is limited. (See <a href=\"#H252165505\" class=\"local\">'Drug-eluting beads'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patient selection is critical to the success of TACE. We restrict this approach to patients with large or multifocal HCCs that are not amenable to resection or local ablation, relatively well-preserved hepatic function (ie, Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis), a good performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 5</a>), and no vascular invasion, main portal vein thrombosis, extrahepatic disease spread, encephalopathy, or biliary obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Relative contraindications to TACE include a variety of other factors including, but not limited to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum bilirubin &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase &gt;425 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aspartate aminotransferase &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumor burden involving &gt;50 percent of the liver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiac or renal insufficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ascites, recent variceal bleed, or significant thrombocytopenia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If chemoembolization using DEBs is carried out, we generally repeat the procedure for each lesion, one month apart. Otherwise, if other techniques are used, we suggest not repeating the TACE procedure, unless there is clear evidence of tumor progression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). TACE should be limited to the minimum number of procedures necessary to control the tumor. In general, we wait at least one month in between procedures if both the right and left lobes require treatment. (See <a href=\"#H252165505\" class=\"local\">'Drug-eluting beads'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The place of radioembolization in the therapeutic armamentarium is unclear. We generally choose this over TACE for patients with advanced HCC who are candidates for local embolization therapy but who have macrovascular invasion such as a portal vein thrombosis. Although radioembolization may be safe in the setting of a portal vein thrombus, median survival is short in these patients, particularly if they have Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. Whether any form of locoregional therapy benefits these patients above and beyond what might be accomplished with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H441999107\" class=\"local\">'Unresectable primary HCC'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-advanced-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H477044332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Sorafenib'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The place of external beam RT among other treatment options for patients with unresectable HCC is currently evolving. Three-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT) or SBRT is a reasonable option for selected patients who are candidates for local treatment modalities and have no extrahepatic disease, limited tumor burden, and relatively good liver function. (See <a href=\"#H2425299089\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SBRT may be complementary to other existing ablative options in patients with tumor vascular thrombus.

We typically perform dynamic cross-sectional imaging and assay alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; if initially elevated) at four weeks, two to three months later, and then at three-month intervals for at least one year. If there has been no recurrence of disease after a year, we then do the same imaging every six months. (See <a href=\"#H2381976013\" class=\"local\">'Assessing response to locoregional therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After two years with no evidence of disease recurrence, we revert back to standard HCC surveillance with ultrasound and assay of serum AFP every six months.
