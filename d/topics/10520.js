These patients have symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion and often require repeated prolonged hospitalizations for intensive management. Patients with chronic HF with severe symptoms despite maximum guideline-directed medical therapy are classified by the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association as having stage D HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Specialized strategies for patients with refractory HFrEF include intravenous vasodilator and inotropic therapy, ultrafiltration, mechanical circulatory support, surgery including cardiac transplantation, and palliative care. </p><p>An overview of therapies used to treat refractory HFrEF is presented here.

While the use of vasopressin antagonists in patients hospitalized with HF may improve symptoms and increase serum sodium concentration, they have no effect on mortality or hospitalization risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Cautions include hepatotoxicity (with the United States Food and Drug Administration warning that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolvaptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolvaptan</a> should be <strong>not</strong> be used in any patient for longer than 30 days and should <strong>not</strong> be used at all in patients with liver disease due to risk of liver failure or death) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia, which can lead to irreversible neurologic injury. These issues are further discussed separately.

Monitoring in hospitalized patients with refractory HF generally includes frequent assessment of arterial blood pressure and pulse, pulse oximetry, and cardiac telemetry. Response to diuretic therapy is assessed by monitoring of fluid intake and output and daily measurement of patient weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84817942\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of pulmonary artery catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the available evidence (including the ESCAPE trial described below), the routine use of pulmonary artery catheter monitoring in HF patients is not recommended. However, the management of a subset of advanced HF patients may still be improved by invasive monitoring and tailored therapy. </p><p>Flow-directed pulmonary artery catheters (Swan-Ganz catheters) can be used for determination of central venous, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as well as for measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. All of these measures may be helpful in the management of patients with HF, particularly those with refractory HF and repeated hospital admissions. Although small uncontrolled studies have suggested that hemodynamic guidance may be of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], these findings were not supported in a randomized trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheterization-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ESCAPE trial included 433 patients with decompensated HF at 26 sites who were randomly assigned to receive therapy guided by clinical assessment and invasive monitoring or by clinical assessment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After six months of follow-up, there was no difference between the two groups in the primary end point of days alive out of the hospital. There was also no significant difference in mortality. Patients in both groups improved with therapy to reduce volume overload.</p><p>Concern has risen regarding a possible increase in mortality in patients who undergo pulmonary artery catheterization. An observational study evaluated the effect of this technique within the first 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit on patient survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A statistical tool, called a propensity score, was used to adjust for treatment selection bias. Patients who underwent right heart catheterization had increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1.24) compared with those who did not undergo the procedure. However, the ESCAPE trial did not support the concern that pulmonary artery catheterization, per se, leads to an increase in mortality. Due to the limitations of observational data and the challenges inherent in randomized trials of critically ill patients, the interpretation of these results has been debated and remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>We concur with the recommendation in the 2013 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association HF guideline that pulmonary artery catheter placement should be performed in patients with respiratory distress or impaired systemic perfusion when clinical assessment is inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2703823842\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful discussion of goals of care and patient preference is important to guide decision making in refractory HF, especially when considering cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support interventions. Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to care that focuses on communication, shared decision making, and advance care planning; it prioritizes relief from pain and other distressing symptoms; it integrates psychological and spiritual aspects of care; and it offers a support system to help families cope during illness and bereavement. Palliative care has a role across the stages of HF, starting early in the course of illness, intensifying in end-stage disease, and extending into caregiver bereavement.

In addition, the associated reduction in collecting tubule sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion can both enhance the diuresis and minimize the degree of potassium wasting. Thus, if not already being given, it is reasonable to initiate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy <strong>prior</strong> to the addition of a thiazide diuretic in patients with a low or low-normal serum potassium on loop diuretic therapy alone. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy should be continued following hospital discharge only in patients who can be carefully monitored for hyperkalemia. When given for diuresis or potassium-sparing effects, a higher dose (up to 100 mg daily) than the usual HF dose may be needed.

Dobutamine is a beta receptor agonist. As such, the inotropic response to dobutamine may be reduced in patients treated with a beta blocker. In general, beta blockers should be discontinued with dobutamine use. In settings in which continuation of beta blockers is preferred, we recommend use of milrinone rather than dobutamine. Most patients will experience an increase in heart rate and blood pressure with use of dobutamine, though response can vary. One approach is to start at an initial dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min,</span> titrating by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> every two hours until an optimal clinical and hemodynamic response is achieved.

Unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, it does not require use of the beta receptor to exert its effect. In addition to its inotropic properties, it is also a vasodilator for both the systemic and pulmonary circulation. As such, the most common side effect limiting its use is hypotension. Like all inotropes, milrinone can be arrhythmogenic. One approach is to start at an initial dose of 0.125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min,</span> titrating by 0.125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> every 6 to 12 hours until an optimal clinical and hemodynamic response is achieved. As the half-life of milrinone (2.3 hours) is much longer than dobutamine, it takes longer to reach a steady state after dosing changes, and titration should occur more slowly.

It is inserted easily and rapidly, is the least expensive of all the devices, and does not require constant monitoring by technical support personnel. However, it is limited in that it is capable of generating only modest hemodynamic support. As such, the IABP is best suited for short-term use (eg, when rapid improvement in the underlying pathology is expected), and evidence for the use of IABP to treat refractory HF is scant. IABPs are often utilized for preoperative optimization for one to three days prior to durable LVAD placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Percutaneous circulatory assist devices (eg, Tandem Heart, Impella) are continuous flow pumps that can provide greater hemodynamic support than an IABP. They can be placed by an experienced operator in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. The Impella is an axial flow pump that is placed across the aortic valve and pumps blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. The Tandem Heart is a percutaneous left atrial to aorta assist device with a venous catheter inserted into the left atrium by transseptal puncture and an arterial cannula inserted into the iliofemoral arterial system. Both types of percutaneous assist devices can be used in patients with cardiogenic shock as a bridge to surgery (such as LVAD or heart transplantation) or recovery and in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, though very little outcome evidence exists for their use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices#H12121202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;, section on 'Non-IABP percutaneous circulatory devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Mechanical support'</a>.)</p><p>Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) is a cardiopulmonary support system that, in addition to helping move blood forward, removes carbon dioxide from and adds oxygen to venous blood using an artificial membrane lung. ECMO systems can be placed via percutaneous (in the cardiac catheterization laboratory) or central (in the operating room) cannulation. In percutaneous (peripheral) cannulation, most often a cannula is inserted into the right atrium via the femoral vein (drainage), with an arterial cannula in the femoral artery (infusion). Central VA ECMO is usually deployed via a median sternotomy with the venous cannula in the right atrium and the arterial cannula in the ascending aorta. Alternate cannulation sites that allow patients to be ambulatory are used in rare circumstances. VA ECMO is most often utilized in patients who require both cardiac and pulmonary support in the setting of cardiogenic shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices#H843686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;, section on 'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation'</a>.) </p><p>Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices can be utilized in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation (bridge to transplantation) or as permanent mechanical assistance (destination therapy) in selected patients who are not eligible for cardiac transplantation.

In rare settings, biventricular support with either biventricular assist devices or a total artificial heart can be utilized in patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation. Durable LVADs are implanted in patients who have failed all other pharmacologic therapies for severe HF. An important consideration is that the device be implanted before there is irreversible end-organ damage. Among patients with refractory HF who are not eligible for transplantation, a long-term LVAD can improve survival compared with optimal medical therapy.
