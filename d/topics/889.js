In some institutions, supratentorial craniotomies without such indications are increasingly performed with patients awake, in order to reduce length of stay, and intensive care unit admissions, and to avoid the risks of general anesthesia. </p><p>The patient is not necessarily awake throughout the entire craniotomy, but is conscious and cooperative during the portions of the procedure that involve testing. The success of awake craniotomy depends on careful patient selection, and coordination between experienced anesthesia and surgical teams.</p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic management for AC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112616 \">table 1</a>). General concerns for anesthesia for craniotomy, and anesthesia for placement of deep brain stimulators, are discussed separately.

Eloquent cortex refers to those parts of the brain that control motor, sensory, or language function. AC may also be used to facilitate electrocorticography for seizure focus localization, to minimize interference from anesthetic medications. Awake craniotomy may be performed without these indications, in order to facilitate enhanced recovery and reduce resource utilization. In some centers, selected patients are discharged on the day of surgery after awake craniotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3071987307\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional cortical mapping of eloquent brain function</strong> &ndash; The primary goal of awake craniotomy for a brain lesion near eloquent cerebral cortex is to enable a tailored resection, to theoretically maximize the extent of the tumor resection and minimize the risk for neurological injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Awake craniotomy is often appropriate for mapping language and sensorimotor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; in addition to the baseline individual variability in the cortical regions associated with these functions, cerebral topography may be distorted by tumor infiltration, radiotherapy, or previous surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The literature on the outcomes of awake craniotomy for tumor consists mostly of prospective cohort studies and retrospective chart reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], with the exception of one small randomized study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>], though not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], studies have reported a lower incidence of new and permanent postoperative neurologic deficits, and higher gross total tumor resection, with awake craniotomy, compared with resection under general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrophysiological mapping and recording &ndash;</strong> Electrocorticography is an invasive electrophysiological technique for direct recording of cortical potentials from the surface of the brain, to localize seizure foci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112455 \">picture 1</a>). Cortical or subcortical signals are easily abolished by anesthetic agents. Thus awake craniotomy may be performed to minimize the pharmacologic interference with the recordings that would occur under general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The need for awake craniotomy for resection of epileptogenic foci has decreased with advancements in presurgical imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In some cases, awake craniotomy for these procedures may preserve language function and predict seizure free outcomes. Intraoperative electrocorticography can help guide the required extent and completeness of the resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Improving perioperative outcomes </strong>&ndash; Craniotomy may be performed awake to reduce the need for intensive care and the length of hospital stay, and in some cases, to reduce complications associated with general anesthesia. Examples of procedures that are commonly performed awake, without the need for functional mapping or electrocorticography, include stereotactic brain biopsy, ventriculostomy, and resection of small brain lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. In some centers, awake craniotomy is used routinely for resection of supratentorial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A number of studies have reported shorter length of stay and reduced or eliminated intensive care unit (ICU) stay for awake craniotomy, compared with general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>], though postoperative disposition varies among institutions. (See <a href=\"#H3071987307\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one prospective observational single institution study involving 200 patients who had awake craniotomy for tumor resection, the median length of hospital stay was three days, and the median time spent in the ICU was zero days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This study spanned seven years; for the last 50 patients, 10 percent spent time in the ICU, and the median length of hospital stay was one day.

The patient is monitored for language deficits such as speech arrest, expressive or receptive aphasia during cortical stimulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual mapping involves monitoring for abnormal visual phenomena (eg, visual hallucinations or phosphenes), or visual field cuts.</p><p/><p>The extent to which the anesthesiologist is involved in sensory and motor mapping depends on institutional practice and the extent of resection. For complex mapping of language and visual areas of the brain, neuropsychologists or speech language therapists are often involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2525813726\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocorticographic recordings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings are performed for intraoperative localization of the epileptogenic focus. Electrodes are placed on the surface of the brain over and adjacent to the suspected epileptogenic foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The quality of ECoG recording is affected by the medications that may be administered for anesthesia or sedation. In particular, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> infusion should be discontinued at least 20 minutes prior to ECoG recording. If necessary, the epileptogenic focus may be stimulated by administration of small doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methohexital</a> (10 to 50 mg), thiopental (25 to 50 mg), propofol (10 to 20 mg), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> (2 to 4 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392392530\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should have a preoperative history and focused physical examination before anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation for craniotomy in general is discussed separately.

A plan for elective or emergent airway management should be determined preoperatively. In addition, patients who are at risk for airway obstruction with sedation (eg, morbidly obese, patients with obstructive sleep apnea) should be identified.</p><p>Careful patient selection and preparation are critical to the success of an awake procedure, and should be coordinated between the surgeon and anesthesiologist. Patients who are identified as candidates for AC by the surgeon should be evaluated in advance of surgery, preferably in a preoperative anesthesia clinic. </p><p>Well-motivated and mature patients who are able to tolerate lying still for several hours, and can cooperate during testing, are the best candidates for awake craniotomy. In some centers, formal preoperative psychologic or psychiatric evaluation is performed to help guide patient selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Criteria for patient selection vary among surgeons and institutions. At the author&rsquo;s institution, the only absolute contraindications for AC are patient refusal and severe claustrophobia. Relative contraindications include conditions that increase the risk of sedation failure, prevent cooperation with necessary testing, or increase the risk of airway compromise, including the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anxiety disorders, emotional instability, claustrophobia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant dysphasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confusion or somnolence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alcohol or drug abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic pain disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low pain tolerance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Morbid obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anticipated difficult airway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uncontrolled coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dyspnea when lying flat</p><p/><p>AC is usually avoided when high blood loss (&gt;750 to 1000 mL) is anticipated, such as in patients with highly vascular tumors and tumors close to cerebral venous sinuses. </p><p>Preoperative medication management and laboratory evaluation prior to craniotomy are discussed separately.

The anesthesia clinician should develop rapport with the patient, and should discuss the rationale for awake surgery, the sequence of the procedure, expected degree of pain and discomfort, tasks required for testing, and the possibility of adverse events. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816778202\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is wide variation in the anesthetic management for awake craniotomy (AC). Numerous case series and reports of individual institutional practice have been published. General considerations, and our strategy for management of awake craniotomy, are discussed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112616 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H807975685\"><span class=\"h2\">Premedication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premedication for craniotomy should be individualized based on the patient&rsquo;s level of anxiety, baseline neurologic status, comorbidities, and the plan for anesthesia. We do not routinely administer premedication preoperatively, though we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> in the operating room at the start of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H1228132775\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Premedication'</a>.)</p><p>Benzodiazepines should be avoided for patients who undergo electrocorticography, since they suppress seizure foci and interfere with recording.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458380365\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors (ie, electrocardiogram [ECG], blood pressure [BP], pulse oximetry, oxygen analyzer, continuous end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO<sub>2</sub>] analyzer) may be sufficient for many ACs. The decision to place an intraarterial catheter, or to monitor for venous air embolism, should be based on patient factors and the surgical procedure. Arterial catheters are rarely placed at the author&rsquo;s institution, where the standard anesthetic technique is conscious sedation for AC. Intraarterial catheters are more commonly placed at other centers, particularly those that use an asleep-awake-asleep technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-craniotomy#H8564068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for craniotomy&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>A processed EEG monitor (eg, bispectral index [BIS], Entropy or SedLine) may facilitate regulation of the dose of anesthetic agents, to allow rapid awakening for intraoperative language testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Placement of the sensors for these monitors on the forehead may not be possible during some craniotomies (eg, frontal craniotomy).</p><p>We do not routinely place a Foley catheter for AC. We do place a Foley catheter when surgery is likely to be longer than four hours, and when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> will be administered intraoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H363795943\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient may be placed in the supine, semi sitting, or lateral position, depending on surgical requirements. The patient&rsquo;s head may be held in skull pins with a Mayfield apparatus, or in some cases, positioned on a gel donut.</p><p>Extreme flexion and rotation of the head should be avoided, to minimize airway obstruction or difficulty with airway management with an open cranium.</p><p>Every effort should be made to make the patient as comfortable as possible, for what may be a several hour (or more) procedure. Discomfort from prolonged positioning is a common complaint among patients who undergo AC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Measures to minimize position related discomfort include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operating table and all contact points should be well padded.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be kept at a comfortably warm temperature, using warm blankets or a forced air warming blanket.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A direct line of sight should be created between the patient and the anesthesia clinician, with space created around the patient&rsquo;s face under the drapes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operating room should be kept as quiet as possible, with a sign on the door alerting staff that the patient is awake.</p><p/><p>We use a microphone during AC to facilitate patient communications with the staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The microphone is particularly useful during language mapping, as it allow the surgeon to hear the patient&rsquo;s responses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642473745\"><span class=\"h2\">Local anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The scalp must be anesthetized for skull pinning, for the incision during ACs performed with conscious sedation, and to avoid pain on emergence for procedures performed with an asleep-awake anesthetic technique. Pin sites are usually anesthetized with local infiltration of 1 to 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> at the site. The scalp can be anesthetized with regional field block, using local anesthetic infiltration around the incision and at pin sites, or with a scalp block.</p><p>The nerve blocks required for a scalp block for AC depend on the location of the incision and craniotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106221 \">figure 1</a>); a full scalp block requires bilateral injection of six nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F105117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105117 \">figure 2</a>), and requires injection of approximately 40 mL of local anesthetic (LA) solution. A long acting LA (ie, 0.25% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, 0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>, or 0.25% levobupivacaine) should be administered, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> 1:200,000, to maximize block duration and minimize systemic absorption. The technique for scalp block is discussed separately.

The total allowable dose of LA should be discussed with the surgeon, and it is helpful to have a protocol in place for LA administration over the course of the procedure.

The scalp block may inadequately cover the incision, the patient may have pain from other structures, or the scalp block may wear off during prolonged surgery. In one study, scalp block was performed with a mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> prior to incision for AC with an asleep-awake-asleep anesthetic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nineteen percent of patients complained of moderate pain when awoken for testing, and another 17 percent had pain by the time they were reanesthetized. &#160;</p><p>Manipulation of the dura is intensely painful, especially with dissection in close proximity to meningeal vessels. Thus the surgeon may have to infiltrate the dura with local anesthetic when conscious sedation is used for AC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Local anesthetic infiltration into the temporalis muscle may also be required for pain during dissection for pterional craniotomy. In addition, local anesthetic infiltration of the scalp may be required for closure at the end of surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3404764\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most strategies for anesthesia for AC include either conscious sedation throughout, or general anesthesia with intraoperative awakening for brain mapping. General anesthesia may be used for both the beginning and the end of the procedure (ie, asleep-awake-asleep), or only for the beginning (ie, asleep-awake). No particular technique is demonstrably better than any other, and the choice of technique is based on clinician and institutional preference. At the author&rsquo;s institution, conscious sedation is the standard AC technique. A meta-analysis of 47 studies that compared asleep-awake-asleep with conscious sedation for AC reported no differences in intraoperative seizures, new neurologic dysfunction, or failure of AC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Importantly, the need for airway management is determined by the choice of anesthetic technique. (See <a href=\"#H2248451701\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3357447441\"><span class=\"h3\">Conscious sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When conscious sedation is used without general anesthesia, sedation is administered during the initial stimulating portions of the procedure, then stopped or reduced during cortical mapping, and resumed for resection and closure.

In one prospective study involving 50 patients who were randomly assigned to conscious sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, 93 percent of patients in both groups were completely satisfied with the experience when asked at 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1311821654\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Awake craniotomy (AC) is most commonly used to allow mapping for resection of brain tumors near eloquent regions of the cerebral cortex, and occasionally for epilepsy surgery. AC may also be performed in order to facilitate enhanced recovery and reduce resource utilization. (See <a href=\"#H4282885631\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful patient selection and preparation are critical to the success of AC. Well-motivated and mature patients who are able to tolerate lying still for several hours, and can cooperate during testing, are the best candidates for awake craniotomy. (See <a href=\"#H392392530\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative airway evaluation is particularly important in anticipation of AC, as access to the airway and options for airway management are limited. A plan for elective or emergent airway management should be determined preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H392392530\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scalp must be anesthetized with local anesthetic infiltration or scalp block for skull pinning, for the incision during ACs performed with conscious sedation, and to avoid pain on emergence for procedures performed with an asleep-awake anesthetic technique. (See <a href=\"#H642473745\" class=\"local\">'Local anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of the varied strategies for AC involve either conscious sedation throughout the procedure, or general anesthesia for the beginning and end, with the patient awake during mapping (asleep-awake-asleep). (See <a href=\"#H3404764\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">No particular technique is demonstrably better than another. Importantly, the need for airway management is determined by the choice of technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For conscious sedation, commonly used medications include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a>, administered by bolus, infusion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> target controlled infusion. Midazolam should be avoided for patients who undergo electrocorticography, and propofol should be turned off at least 20 minutes prior to electrocorticography. (See <a href=\"#H4248819705\" class=\"local\">'Choice of medications for conscious sedation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer to use conscious sedation for most patients who undergo AC. Our strategy includes infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a>, with intermittent boluses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1193504770\" class=\"local\">'Strategy for conscious sedation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For an asleep-awake-asleep technique, general anesthesia is induced, the airway is secured, and anesthesia is maintained until the dura is opened. The patient is then awakened, the airway device is removed, and cortical mapping is performed. General anesthesia is then induced again and maintained for the remainder of the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2208282016\" class=\"local\">'Asleep awake asleep'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2248451701\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Total intravenous anesthesia is commonly used for this technique, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> for induction followed by infusion of propofol, short acting opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> boluses or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> infusion), with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> infusion. (See <a href=\"#H3410955630\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic agents for general anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When we use an asleep-awake-asleep technique, we use total intravenous anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway. (See <a href=\"#H4075761813\" class=\"local\">'Strategy for asleep-awake-asleep technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative complications of awake craniotomy include seizures, respiratory complications, pain, nausea and vomiting, hemodynamic perturbations, brain edema, and failure of the awake procedure (ie, either conversion to general anesthesia, or failure to complete mapping). (See <a href=\"#H1915817428\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Seizures occur most commonly during stimulation for brain mapping. First line treatment for seizures should be irrigation of the brain with iced saline. If necessary, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> (10 to 20 mg IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (1 to 2 mg IV) should be administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate postoperative care is the same for AC as it is for craniotomy with general anesthesia. Disposition after AC varies among institutions; intensive care admission after AC is avoided for many patients, particularly when conscious sedation is used. (See <a href=\"#H3071987307\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-awake-craniotomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Manninen PH, Balki M, Lukitto K, Bernstein M.
