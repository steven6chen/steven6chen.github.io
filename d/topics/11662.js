It is usually passed on in families, but children can sometimes get it even if their parents do not have it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18518115\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the signs and symptoms of NF1?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal growths or tumors (called &quot;neurofibromas&quot;) that form on the skin and along nerves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blotches of light brown skin that look like giant freckles (called &quot;caf&eacute;-au-lait spots&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freckling of the skin in the armpits and in the crease where the legs meet the body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spots on the colored part of the eye that look like tiny freckles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the way bones form, which can cause:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bumps along the arms or legs that look like joints but aren't</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Deformed body parts (including the face)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A curved spine or backbone (called &quot;scoliosis&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bones that break easily</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short height for age</p><p/><p>NF1 can also cause tumors to form inside the brain, around the nerves that connect the brain to the eye, and in other parts of the body. Some of these tumors can become cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18518130\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take my child to see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child develops any of the signs or symptoms listed above, take him or her to see the doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18518145\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If the doctor or nurse suspects your child has NF1, he or she will do an exam and ask you questions. Doctors can diagnose NF1 based on the results of the exam.</p><p>There is a blood test to check for the genetic problem that causes NF1. But doctors can diagnose NF1 without that test, so it is not always needed. If your child does have the genetic test, keep in mind that a child can have the genetic problem that causes NF1 but have only mild symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18518160\"><span class=\"h1\">How is NF1 treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important part of treatment involves checking for changes that could mean NF1 is causing problems. Children with NF1 must see the doctor at least once a year and have certain tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87043 \">table 1</a>). If NF1 starts causing certain problems, those problems must be treated. For example, if a skin growth gets too big or starts causing pain, surgery can be done to remove the growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18518192\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child wants to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a chance your child would have children with the same problem. When your child grows up, he or she should talk to a doctor to find out what the risks might be.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18518207\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child will need medical care throughout his or her life. It's best if he or she is treated by a team of experts who have experience with NF1. As your child ages, he or she will probably develop more neurofibromas and other health problems caused by NF1. Many of these problems can be dealt with, but some are very serious.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
