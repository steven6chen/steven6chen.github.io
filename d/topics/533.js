Compared with population growth, these increases have been attributed mostly to improved diagnostic modalities resulting in early detection of cancer and to the development of more effective and less toxic treatments. This increase in survival rates highlights the importance of caring for cancer survivors.</p><p>While smoking rates have continuously decreased over several decades, the overall smoking prevalence in the US had remained nearly constant for several years with some palpable decline in the past few years to 15.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This amounts to 36 million Americans who smoke despite the widespread knowledge that smoking and tobacco use cause cancer as well as cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and several other deadly diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Unlike tobacco, the carcinogenic effects of alcohol have been scientifically established only within the last two decades. Though many alcohol users are informed about organ damage caused by alcohol and the dangers and the legal and social consequences of being intoxicated, far fewer recognize the significant cancer risk of heavy alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>There are limited data that speak to the benefits of stopping smoking and alcohol use that are specific to cancer survivors. However, it stands to reason that cancer survivors may attain at least similar health benefits with the adoption of healthy lifestyles, including moderate alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. This review discusses the data regarding these topics as they relate to cancer survivors who have completed cancer-directed treatment and are in remission. Further discussion on alcohol and tobacco is covered elsewhere.

In one survey, almost 20 percent of cancer survivors reported being current smokers, with a high rate of 43 percent of cancer survivors younger than 40 years reporting current smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The overall prevalence of current smoking among cancer survivors is approximately 23 percent during the first year after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although it appears to fall drastically with time to approximately 9 percent after nine years following a cancer diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Among survivors, cancer treatment itself seems to have a positive influence on lowering the rate of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Although a poor prognosis does not usually motivate patients to quit, a cancer site that is clearly attributable to smoking does, especially if patients have a favorable prognosis. In addition, the nature of the cancer treatment required affects the ability to smoke; for example, cancer patients who need to be hospitalized or undergo surgery will be forced to quit smoking, at least for a short time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18659094\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies show that despite a cancer diagnosis, survivors continue to consume alcohol.

A separate study that included over 280 patients with head and neck cancer reported that 45 percent of these patients continued to consume alcohol 12 months after diagnosis, with over 20 percent of those who continued to drink classified as problem drinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541369836\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact on outcomes after cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most data come from retrospective studies, smoking appears to have a deleterious impact on cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Studies have demonstrated the harmful effect of continued smoking on cancer treatment in cancers of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-24</a>], oropharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], and breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As examples, one study reported that cancer patients who were smokers had a significantly higher symptom burden than nonsmokers, both during and six months following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As another example, relapse rates in lung or head and neck cancer patients 12 months after surgery were markedly higher in patients who were still smoking the week before surgery (60 percent) versus those who were abstinent during the week before surgery (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Finally, in a separate study, prostate cancer patients who continued to smoke during treatment were at an increased risk for toxicity, recurrence, metastasis, and mortality compared with nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The effect of continuing to smoke for cancer survivors is similarly alarming:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one review that included 10 studies, people who continued to smoke after a diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer almost doubled their risk of dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study that included 611 patients with small cell lung cancer, the risk of all second cancers (mostly non-small cell cancers of the lung) was increased by 3.5 times in smokers (relative risk [RR] 3.5, 95% CI 2.8-4.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Compared with never-smokers, the risk of a second lung cancer among patients who received chest radiation was significantly increased (RR 13, 95% CI 9.4-17.0).<br/></p><p>In addition, several studies show that cancer survivors who were former <span class=\"nowrap\">smokers/recent</span> quitters or current smokers scored lower on quality of life indices and had worse health and social functioning than did survivors who had never smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/26,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35-37</a>].</p><p>Accumulating data also suggest that alcohol intake (especially moderate to heavy use) increases cancer-related mortality. This was shown in a 2013 meta-analysis that concluded all-cancer mortality was highest in participants who regularly consumed 50 or more grams of alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Curiously, this report also reported the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a J-shaped curve in regard to all-cancer mortality; patients who drank &lt;12.5 grams of alcohol per day had the lowest mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality associated with alcohol was predominantly in men. Men who consumed up to 12.8 grams of ethanol daily had the lowest mortality rate. However, those who drank &ge;28.7 grams per day had a statistically significant increase in their cancer mortality rate. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women, consumption of up to 9.1 grams of alcohol daily was associated with the lowest cancer mortality. The risk of mortality became significant at 17.4 grams per day and reached a peak at 43.6 grams daily. Interestingly, in the female study population, 75.9 grams or more of daily ethanol intake was associated with less all-cancer mortality, most likely owing to the fact that if a woman were to consume such large amounts, her chances of non-cancer mortality were increased significantly when compared with non-alcoholic women or men.</p><p/><p>A subsequent study showed that overall mortality from cancer and other diseases was five times higher in Italian alcoholics than in Italians who did not drink alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This study concluded that being female was a protective factor, as women outlived men at the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year follow-up analyses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541370872\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is imperative for clinicians working with cancer survivors to evaluate those survivors for smoking and alcohol use. Systematic screening for tobacco use has been recommended for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and in the United States (US), this effort accelerated in early 2013 as part of the &quot;meaningful use&quot; initiatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In the absence of a specific diagnostic evaluation tailored to cancer survivors, screening for use and abuse should take place as with patients without a history of cancer.

While there are no specific demographics, smoking and tobacco use among cancer survivors would be expected to be more frequent in certain populations than in others, as in the general population, including those with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low educational attainment &ndash; Up to 25 percent of those with less than a high school degree and 45 percent of those with only a GED are smokers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low socioeconomic status &ndash; Almost 30 percent of those under the federal poverty level are smokers.</p><p/><p>Several studies have reported a positive correlation between smoking <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive alcohol use with psychiatric disorders within the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/44-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-54</a>]. In an observational study of cancer patients, while higher levels of pre-quitting anxiety and fear of recurrence predicted smoking cessation, higher levels of depressive symptoms significantly predicted relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Whether similar figures are relevant among cancer survivors is not entirely clear, but this association within the general population has major implications, including the propensity to develop an addiction to substances and having more difficulty quitting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Additionally, the impact of psychiatric comorbidities would be expected to be similarly important among cancer survivors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48068094\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a lack of data on interventions specific to cancer survivors, particularly for issues related to stopping or decreasing alcohol use. However, for some patients, treatment of other conditions may aid in their ability to quit smoking and reduce alcohol intake. As an example, treating co-occurring psychiatric disorders has the potential to increase cancer patients' resilience, their ability to face cancer, and arguably, their ability to maintain abstinence after quitting tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] or further limiting (or stopping) alcohol intake. As reported in one study, patients with low depression scores and patients with early tumor stages were more confident about their ability to quit smoking than were those with higher depression scores and those with more advanced tumor stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>Only a few well-designed prospective studies on smoking cessation have focused on cancer patients, with approximately half concentrating on nurse-delivered interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A meta-analysis reported that providing a smoking cessation intervention to cancer patients in general did not improve overall cessation rates, although it was clear that heavy smokers and those in the perioperative period did benefit from this type of intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This mixed finding may be due to lack of homogeneity among the pooled studies, as the studies had different measures for smoking and abstinence and included different cancer sites and cancer patient populations (outpatients only or inpatients only). Nevertheless, smoking cessation medications are reported to be as effective in cancer patients and survivors as they are in patients without cancer or history of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Little is known about the naturalistic factors that impede smoking cessation efforts in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. An overview of smoking cessation management and the pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-smoking-cessation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment for alcohol use is similar to tobacco in that both require psychosocial support and pharmacological interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial treatment of alcohol use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541371723\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although stopping smoking is recommended unequivocally, whether there is a &quot;safe&quot; amount of alcohol one can consume is controversial. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Health Services suggest that a limit of two drinks per day (13.7 grams per drink) for men and one drink per day for women is &quot;sensible&quot; or &quot;low-risk&quot; drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>However, this recommendation is based on studies that evaluate the short-term effects of alcohol use (eg, social or psychological problems or hospital admissions) and may not account for all the risks and consequences of chronic, long-term exposure. Therefore, many critics have pointed to the limitations of such &quot;sensible drinking&quot; guidelines. It should also be noted that these guidelines do not apply to all subsets of a population. For example, pregnant women, children, older adults, or those who operate machinery cannot use the &quot;sensible drinking&quot; guidelines to determine whether their level of alcohol consumption is safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541372159\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF ALCOHOL ON SMOKING CESSATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are very limited data on the cancer-specific outcomes associated with tobacco cessation or the reduction of alcohol intake in patients who have been diagnosed with cancer. However, they would be expected to benefit from these interventions in ways similar to the general population (ie, those without a history of cancer), which may include a lower risk of a second cancer. This might include a lowered risk of a smoking-related malignancy, which as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, includes cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, esophagus, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, larynx, lung, uterine cervix, ovary (mucinous histology), urinary bladder, kidney, ureter, and myeloid leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Conversely, a data analysis of five cohort studies of survivors of first cancers found a 5 to 8 percent increase in five-year cumulative risks of second smoking-associated cancers, comparing current smoker at time of first cancer versus never-smoker, that is among current smoking survivors of stage I lung, bladder, kidney, and <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck</span> cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>Quitting smoking at the very least appears to have a positive impact on quality of life among cancer survivors. This was shown in a systematic review of medical databases for articles published since the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Quitting smoking after a diagnosis of cancer was associated with a better performance status compared with continued smokers. However, some data suggest that overall survival may also be impacted. One analysis aimed to estimate the effects of quitting smoking after a cancer diagnosis using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in the United States (US) and cancer registry data from New South Wales, Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In this model, individuals who continued to smoke eight years after a cancer diagnosis were estimated to have a lower survival compared with non-smokers in both the US (43 versus 54 percent, respectively) and Australian populations (37 versus 49 percent). Despite the lack of prospective data evaluating the outcomes for cancer survivors who quit smoking following treatment for their malignancy, these data suggest that they are likely to benefit as much as (if not more than) those who quit smoking and do not have a history of cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H2589684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Benefits of smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p>The data evaluating the impact of interventions to reduce or discontinue alcohol consumption in cancer survivors are even more limited, and no prospective studies have been done to inform the benefits of such an intervention. However, limiting alcohol consumption has other health benefits, which are important for patients after treatment for cancer, as in the general population. These benefits are reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H541370872\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a lack of data on interventions specific to cancer survivors, particularly for issues related to alcohol cessation. However, for some patients, treatment of other conditions may aid in their ability to quit smoking and reduce alcohol intake. As an example, treating co-occurring psychiatric disorders has the potential to increase cancer patients' resilience, their ability to face cancer, and arguably, their ability to maintain abstinence after quitting tobacco or further limiting (or stopping) alcohol intake. (See <a href=\"#H48068094\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are very limited data on the cancer-specific outcomes associated with smoking cessation or the reduction of alcohol intake in patients who have been diagnosed with cancer. However, they would be expected to benefit from these interventions as do the general population (ie, those without a history of cancer), including a lower risk of a second cancer. (See <a href=\"#H541372159\" class=\"local\">'Impact of alcohol on smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H991602197\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors would like to recognize Dr. Ellen Gritz, who contributed to previous versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-and-smoking-cessation-for-cancer-survivors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mokdad AH, Marks JS, Stroup DF, Gerberding JL.
