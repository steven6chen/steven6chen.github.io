Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective therapy for OSA, but adherence is suboptimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence, consequences, and identification of nonadherence will be reviewed here. Interventions that may improve adherence are also discussed. Initiation of CPAP therapy is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NONADHERENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3844105589\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus on the definition of nonadherent use to CPAP treatment. We suggest that less than four hours be used as a general metric, since several studies have shown that normalization of daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and neurocognitive function improve with four or more hours of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Improvements in cardiovascular disease conditions and diabetes have also been greater in those using CPAP for greater than four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Studies have used four hours as the cutoff point differentiating adherence and nonadherence to the treatment, and consequently insurers have also adopted this cutoff. However, outcome expectations should be individually defined to determine the appropriate target for nightly usage.</p><p>The expectation of nightly use is dependent upon patient goals. For example, one study showed that in those who have impaired levels on several salient outcomes, the duration of use to achieve a normal value depends on the metric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the goal is to improve self-reported sleepiness, four hours of use was sufficient to achieve a normal score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In evaluating fitness for duty in a commercial truck driver, six hours would be needed to achieve a normal level of objective alertness in the multiple sleep latency test, and 7.5 hours would be required to improve to normal daytime functioning on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Five hours of use improved neurobehavioral performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that 29 to 83 percent of patients are nonadherent, when nonadherence is defined as a mean of &le;4 hours of use per night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The mean duration of use is only three hours per night (on those nights when it is used) among patients who are nonadherent. In contrast, the mean duration of CPAP use is six hours per night among patients who use it every night as directed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall, the average duration of CPAP use is approximately five hours per night across numerous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies indicate that greater than six hours per night results in normal levels of objectively measured and self-reported daytime sleepiness, as well as significantly improved memory and daily functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/2,3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10</a>].</p><p>Patients generally make the decision to adhere to CPAP therapy early during the first week of therapy, usually by the second to fourth day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-13</a>]. Those who adhere generally increase their duration of nightly use gradually. As an example, one study demonstrated that patients who used CPAP for more than two years increased their duration of use approximately eight minutes per night during each year of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even one night without CPAP may mitigate the benefits of CPAP therapy, which include fewer apneas and hypopneas, reduced daytime sleepiness, and improvements in sleep architecture, daily activity, quality of life, hypertension, and neurobehavioral performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/9,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15-18</a>]. This was illustrated by a trial that included 41 patients with OSA who had been using CPAP successfully for at least one year without subjective daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. After four nights of not using CPAP, the frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturation events (defined as a decrease in the oxyhemoglobin saturation exceeding 4 percentage points of saturation) increased during sleep, indicating recurrence of OSA. The patients were then randomly assigned to a CPAP withdrawal group (ie, subtherapeutic CPAP) or a CPAP group (ie, therapeutic CPAP) for two weeks. CPAP withdrawal led to recurrence of abnormal respiratory events (mean AHI &gt;25 events per hour) within one night, increased morning and evening blood pressure within two weeks, and increased morning heart rate within two weeks. Subjective daytime sleepiness measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale also increased within two weeks, although the sleepiness score remained less than ten (ie, considered within normal range). CPAP withdrawal was not associated with deterioration of psychomotor performance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPAP use should be routinely determined using objective criteria and monitored sequentially over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Some older CPAP machines contain meters that record the duration that the machine is turned on. This approach is limited by its inability to differentiate the duration that the patient is receiving CPAP therapy from the duration that the machine is simply turned on and potentially not being used. These durations are estimated to differ by about 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most current CPAP machines can differentially record mask-on and machine-on time.</p><p>CPAP manufacturers provide several ways to obtain adherence data from the devices. Most machines have a digital display that shows data, typically for the prior 30 days. Additionally, a data card (usually a secure digital [SD] card) can be inserted into the CPAP machine, removed by the patient, and taken or mailed to the provider's office to be read by a card-reader device. Alternatively, the information can be transmitted by modem or wireless transmission with internet interactive software becoming increasingly common. Provider-specific reports can then be generated, including graphic displays. The reports may include total device use, mean device use, specific patterns of use (eg, how many nights per week CPAP was used for a certain duration), mask leaks, and an estimated apnea hypopnea index (AHI<sub>flow</sub>). Such advances in data collection and transmission should enable the provider to routinely monitor CPAP use and to intervene when use is suboptimal.</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that the definitions for apneas and hypopneas vary among different CPAP tracking system manufacturers, and data on mask leaks and residual <span class=\"nowrap\">apneas/hypopneas</span> are not always easy to interpret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Given this consideration, the goals of therapy are low levels for residual <span class=\"nowrap\">apneas/hypopneas</span> and mask leak, with intervention required for high number of residual events and level of mask leak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential predictors of <strong>adherence</strong> are described in this section; potential predictors of <strong>nonadherence</strong> are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F50144\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50144 \">table 1</a>). We emphasize the concept of potential predictors, since these factors have not consistently been proven to reliably predict which patients will adhere to CPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/8,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24-26</a>].</p><p>The following factors have been associated with better long-term adherence with CPAP therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence with CPAP during the first week of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased self-reported daytime sleepiness (ie, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score &gt;10) plus moderate to severe OSA (ie, an apnea hypopnea index &gt;15 events per hour of sleep) (weak relationship) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater severity of oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large nasal passages and low nasal resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPAP titration via attended polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain psychological traits, including lack of claustrophobic tendencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], presence of problem solving skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], optimism regarding the benefit of CPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], and self-efficacy (defined as a positive subjective assessment of one's motivation, volition, and confidence to engage in a healthy behavior) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/1,27,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27,35,36</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient made the decision to seek medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect of CPAP on the bed partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater severity of OSA (weak relationship) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/4,8,9,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9,24,27</a>]</p><p/><p>It is uncertain whether the routine application of heated humidification predicts adherence, since the evidence is conflicting.

Aspects of motivational interviewing include interaction with the patient utilizing questions to identify perceptions, behaviors, and volitions that are barriers to engaging in the treatment.

Four to six weeks later, the eszopiclone group used their CPAP on more nights (76 versus 60 percent of nights) and for a longer duration (4 versus 3 hours) than the placebo group. In an analysis that assumed that losses to follow up had no CPAP use, the results were similar but no longer statistically significant. The authors of the study reported industry support limited to provision of the drug only.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a second study, 134 patients with newly diagnosed OSA (median AHI 17 events per hour) undergoing initial split-night PSG were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zaleplon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zaleplon</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. After one month, complete data were only available for 83 patients (62 percent). In these patients, median daily CPAP use was the same in those treated with zaleplon (6.5 hours) compared with those treated with placebo (6.5 hours). Patients treated with zaleplon had shorter sleep latency than those treated with placebo (18 versus 26 minutes) but no difference in measures of daytime sleepiness. The authors of the study reported no industry involvement or support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extended dosing was tested in a trial that randomized 72 male CPAP-na&iuml;ve patients with OSA (mean AHI 42 events per hour) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>, placebo, or standard of care for the first 14 days of CPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. After one month, there was no difference in CPAP compliance among the three groups as measured by average nightly CPAP use (zolpidem, 4.4 hours; placebo, 4.2 hours; standard of care, 4.9 hours) or total days used. All groups showed significant improvement in daytime sleepiness. The authors of the study reported no industry involvement or support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a larger trial, 160 patients with newly diagnosed OSA (mean AHI 37 events per hour) were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eszopiclone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eszopiclone</a> (3 mg) or placebo during the initial 14 nights of CPAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. After six months of follow-up, the eszopiclone group used their CPAP device for more nights (64 versus 45 percent of nights) and for a longer duration (4 versus 3 hours) than the placebo group. The eszopiclone group was also less likely to discontinue CPAP therapy (42 versus 58 percent). The authors of this study reported grant support from the maker of eszopiclone.</p><p/><p>Until further data become available, we do not suggest use of a sedative-hypnotic at the time of CPAP initiation.

Impediments to adherence must first be identified and characterized, especially the role of patient perceptions. Interventions based on social cognitive therapy that target these impediments, such as motivational interviewing-based approaches and feedback using patient-centered software highlighting adherence, and telehealth, need to be developed and their effectiveness confirmed in clinical trials. In addition, better understanding the contribution of the bed partner cannot be overlooked. Additionally, the role of residual sleepiness in adherence should be addressed. Further trials are required to determine which patient populations benefit from telehealth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3735953378\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective therapy for OSA, but adherence is suboptimal. There is no consensus on the definition of nonadherent use to CPAP treatment. We suggest that four hours be used as a general metric, but outcome expectations should be individually defined to determine the appropriate target for nightly usage. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nonadherence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPAP use should be routinely monitored using objective criteria in the first few weeks of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Identification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of proven risk factors for poor adherence has hindered the development of interventions to prevent nonadherence. Until such risk factors are identified, management of the side effects of CPAP therapy and behavioral therapy seem to be the most reasonable approaches to improve adherence (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Interventions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A multidisciplinary approach to managing side effects related to CPAP therapy has been developed and is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F66488\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66488 \">algorithm 1</a>). This approach recognizes that most side effects can be corrected by simple interventions. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Side effect management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Behavioral therapy can improve adherence with CPAP. We suggest that all patients with OSA who are prescribed CPAP receive behavioral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The consequences of OSA and the beneficial effects of CPAP should be emphasized, especially by frequent contact and follow-up during the first week of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are conflicting data regarding use of sedative-hypnotics at the time of CPAP initiation. Until further data become available, we do not suggest use of a sedative-hypnotic at the time of CPAP initiation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is based on the larger effect sizes observed in studies using behavioral therapy and the greater risk of side effects from drug therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacological therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The pathophysiology of residual sleepiness in adherent (&gt;6 hours use) patients remains unclear. However, some studies have shown that treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a> improves alertness.
