This review will describe the abnormalities in steroid hormones that are present in this disorder, including the factors responsible for the increase in androgen production. The clinical manifestations of PCOS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANDROGEN METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a group, women with PCOS have serum concentrations of testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) that are significantly elevated compared with ovulatory, nonhirsute women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72842 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There is, however, significant individual variation, and some women with PCOS may have normal androgen levels when assayed in a single blood specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In women, androgens are produced by the adrenal glands and the ovaries, as well as by conversion of less potent to more potent androgens in the periphery. The source of the major androgens in PCOS is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60049 \">table 1</a>). In PCOS, androstenedione and testosterone are secreted primarily by the ovaries and to a lesser degree the adrenals. This pattern differs from that in normal premenopausal women who have approximately equal androstenedione and testosterone production from the ovaries and the adrenals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Testosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testosterone is the most potent circulating androgen. Its biologic activity is determined by the amount of binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), as only the free fraction is active, and by the rate of conversion of testosterone to the potent intracellular androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dihydrotestosterone'</a> below). Serum SHBG concentrations are controlled by androgens (decrease), estrogens (increase), and insulin (decrease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, hyperandrogenic women with PCOS tend to have low serum SHBG concentrations. This decrease tends to mask the degree of testosterone excess if only serum total testosterone concentration is measured. Thus, a higher proportion of women with PCOS have elevated serum free testosterone concentrations than have elevated serum total testosterone concentrations.</p><p>Body mass index (BMI) is positively correlated with serum total testosterone and inversely correlated with SHBG concentrations in women of all reproductive ages.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study of 1526 Scandinavian premenopausal women (mean age 31 years), increasing BMI was associated with increased serum testosterone and decreased serum SHBG concentrations in both ovulatory and oligoovulatory women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar associations were observed in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), of 2930 perimenopausal women (mean age 46 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and in a study of menopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Cigarette smoking is associated with increased serum testosterone concentrations in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. It is not known if discontinuing smoking is associated with a subsequent decrease in serum testosterone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Androstenedione</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androstenedione is the immediate precursor to testosterone. Androstenedione is converted to testosterone by the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17-ketosteroid reductase) enzyme, which is present in most tissues. In the ovary of ovulatory women, the theca cells secrete significant quantities of androstenedione, which enters the granulosa cells and is converted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> and estradiol. Luteinizing hormone (LH) directly stimulates thecal secretion of androstenedione. In PCOS, LH levels are elevated so the theca secretes increased quantities of androstenedione. In addition, thecal cells from women with PCOS are more sensitive to LH stimulation of androgen production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The androstenedione secreted into the circulation by the ovary and adrenal can be converted to the potent androgen, testosterone, by most peripheral tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of DHEAS derives from the adrenal glands, and there is little, if any, sulfotransferase (sulfokinase) activity in the periphery to convert DHEA to DHEAS. As a result, the serum concentration of DHEAS is a good marker of adrenal androgen hypersecretion. In addition, since DHEAS has a long serum half-life, with minimal pulsatile or diurnal variation, a single measurement of serum DHEAS correlates well with integrated measures of DHEAS secretion.</p><p>However, some adrenocortical carcinomas have no sulfotransferase activity, and some patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have normal DHEAS levels. Thus, normal serum DHEAS concentrations do not necessarily exclude a pathologic adrenal source of excess androgens.</p><p>Although DHEA and DHEAS are markers of adrenal androgen production, they have little if any intrinsic androgenic activity. Small amounts are converted to androstenedione and then to testosterone (and to estrogen) in both the adrenal glands and peripheral tissues, including hair follicles and external genitalia. Thus, the hirsutism and virilization that may occur in patients with adrenal hyperandrogenism are caused by androstenedione and testosterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-hyperandrogenism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal hyperandrogenism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dihydrotestosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testosterone binds to the intracellular androgen receptor with modest affinity. In androgen-responsive tissues, intracellular 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone to DHT. DHT binds to the androgen receptor with an affinity 10 times greater than testosterone. There are multiple subtypes of 5-alpha reductase. In a tissue such as the prostate, the type II isoenzyme predominates, while in the pilosebaceous unit, both the type I and II isoforms are present. Women with PCOS have increased 5-alpha reductase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], resulting in increased activation of the pilosebaceous unit (hair growth, sebum production) with only modest increases in bioavailable testosterone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Androstanediol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>3-alpha-androstanediol-glucuronide (3aA-G) is derived from the metabolism of the potent intracellular androgen DHT. It can therefore be used as a marker of peripheral androgen metabolism. Serum concentrations of 3aA-G are almost uniformly high in women with hirsutism. Except for research purposes, however, it is probably unnecessary to measure 3aA-G as the presence of hirsutism by definition indicates that androgen activity in the skin is increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTROGEN METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with PCOS have serum estradiol concentrations similar to the early follicular phase of ovulatory women and elevated serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52544 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The serum estrogens in women with PCOS come partly from the multiple small follicles in the polycystic ovaries and partly from aromatization of androgens to estrogens in fat cells.</p><p>The net effect is that PCOS is a normoestrogenic state, and estrogen replacement is not required, even in amenorrheic women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are oligo- or anovulatory and do not produce normal quantities of progesterone. Consequently, they are at an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and heavy menstrual bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROL OF ANDROGEN PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The control of androgen production in women is complex because the androgens are produced in multiple sites. In both the ovaries and adrenal glands, androgen secretion requires the activity of multiple steroidogenic enzymes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71558 \">figure 3</a>), including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholesterol synthesis &ndash; All gonadal steroid synthesis begins with synthesis of cholesterol and its transport to steroidogenic tissues in lipoproteins.

Theca cells synthesize mostly androstenedione and some testosterone, which diffuse across the basement membrane to the granulosa cells. The granulosa cells, in response to stimulation by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), produce aromatase, which converts the androgen precursors to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> and estradiol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76006 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In women with PCOS, ovarian androgen production may increase as a result of one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased volume of theca cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased LH stimulation of the theca cells.

In addition, theca cells from the ovaries of women with PCOS demonstrate increased CYP17 and 3-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro experiments with human theca cells have demonstrated a synergistic effect of LH and insulin to increase androgen secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Several studies in obese women with PCOS are compatible with a contributory role of insulin. As an example, reducing the degree of insulin resistance with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] or reducing insulin secretion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazoxide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] results in a fall in serum androgen concentrations.</p><p>The association of insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia in women with PCOS results in the &quot;insulin paradox&quot; since a resistant organ should not be able to hyperrespond. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this paradox:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high serum insulin concentrations may activate the homologous receptors for insulin-like growth factors-1 and -2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2).

This hypothesis has not yet been demonstrated in women with PCOS.</p><p/><p>Regardless of the mechanism, it appears that some women with PCOS have insulin resistance in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver but demonstrate insulin sensitivity in the ovary. A 1995 report described a woman with PCOS and severe insulin resistance (in terms of glucose metabolism) in whom ovarian insulin sensitivity was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3950723810\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AMH circulating levels are increased in women with PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/steroid-hormone-metabolism-in-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Testosterone bound to SHBG is believed to not be bioavailable to tissues. Free testosterone and testosterone weakly bound to albumin are thought to be available to stimulate androgen activity in target tissues such as the hair follicle. In PCOS, hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance reduce hepatic production of SHBG and decrease circulating SHBG levels. The decrease in SHBG results in a proportionate increase in free testosterone, increasing testosterone bioactivity, and, at the same time, decreasing total testosterone levels.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Zawadzki JK, Dunaif A.
