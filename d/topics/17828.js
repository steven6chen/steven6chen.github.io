Knowledge of subtle clinical features and laboratory abnormalities that accompany LEMS permits the early identification of the disorder. Early recognition of LEMS is particularly important because of its strong association with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Although LEMS can occur at any point in the course of SCLC, it may serve as a marker for early disease, and thus allow more effective treatment of this malignancy.</p><p>This topic will review treatment for LEMS. The clinical features and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

Suspicion for lung cancer is particularly high among patients with a history of smoking who are &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Population studies have consistently shown that approximately one-half of LEMS cases are associated with a malignancy, which is usually SCLC. In a clinical series that included 50 patients with LEMS, SCLC was present in 21 of 25 patients (84 percent) with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. From the perspective of patients who have SCLC, the incidence and prevalence of LEMS are estimated to be approximately 3 percent each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

In a cohort study of Dutch and English patients with LEMS, clinical factors within the first three months from LEMS onset that independently predicted the presence of SCLC were age &ge;50 years, history of smoking at diagnosis, weight loss &ge;5 percent, bulbar involvement, erectile dysfunction in men, and Karnofsky performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>) score &lt;70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

A DELTA-P score of 0 or 1 was associated with a SCLC probability of 0 and 3 percent, respectively.

If the response is inadequate, 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) can be added (at 10 to 25 mg three or four times daily) where available. If 3,4-DAP is not available, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a> can be added to pyridostigmine, but only as a last resort due to its potentially serious adverse effects. If used, guanidine can be started at 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, given in three to four divided doses, and gradually increased if needed. Doses less than 1000 mg per day are preferred for a majority of patients to reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Pyridostigmine is used in a wide dose range between 30 and 180 mg at dosing intervals between three and six hours, depending upon side effects and clinical response. Nausea, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea are adverse effects seen in approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients and can be major limiting factors, but they are dose-dependent, being uncommon at low doses and common at high doses. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have no major systemic toxicities, which makes them a good choice for a first line therapy.</p><p>The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are, unfortunately, only marginally effective in isolation for the treatment of LEMS. They have also been used as adjunct treatment in patients receiving 3,4-DAP in the hope that this combination, which is well tolerated, confers additional symptomatic benefit. However, the utility of this approach is uncertain and high-quality data are sparse. One randomized controlled crossover trial of nine patients with LEMS compared 3,4-DAP, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, the combination of both drugs, and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The mechanism of action is potassium channel blockade that significantly prolongs the presynaptic nerve terminal membrane depolarization, which enhances calcium entry and thereby improves the release of acetylcholine.</p><p>3,4-DAP is the best-tolerated aminopyridine due to its limited central nervous system (CNS) penetration, but it is not widely available. The effectiveness of 3,4-DAP compared with placebo for improving motor and autonomic symptoms in LEMS was demonstrated in five small randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19-23</a>].

The side effects of 3,4-DAP at typical therapeutic doses are usually mild, mainly perioral and extremity paresthesias. However, seizures have occurred at higher doses and the medication should be used with caution in any patient with severe asthma, a prolonged QT interval or in conjunction with any medication known to prolong the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>].</p><p>3,4-DAP may increase the risk of seizures, particularly at high doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and should be used cautiously at the lowest dose possible in patients with epilepsy. A maximum total 3,4-DAP dose of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> typically given as 20 mg four times daily, is recommended by some experts to minimize the risk of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

It is offered on a compassionate use basis for patients with LEMS from Jacobus Pharmaceutical in Princeton, New Jersey (phone 609-921-7447).

Some experts are reluctant to use oral immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine in patients with cancer because of concerns that such treatment may exacerbate the malignancy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Prednisone'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1861930555\" class=\"local\">'Other oral immunosuppressive agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Our preferred alternative regimen to IVIG is to start <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, or 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) simultaneously, followed later by an attempt to taper or discontinue prednisone in order to reduce long-term prednisone toxicity.

This category likely includes patients with renal insufficiency and a serum creatinine &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&gt;133 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L),</span> cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, cardiovascular disease, or advanced age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Prednisone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no large-scale treatment trials to guide medication selection, but many smaller studies and case reports have commented upon the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] or combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or plasmapheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. Oral prednisone for LEMS is typically started at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day or 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every other day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This dose is maintained until clinically significant improvement is evident, which may take several months. At that point, a slow tapering of the prednisone dose can begin. Glucocorticoid tapering should be individualized in patients with LEMS, based upon the clinical situation. A reasonable tapering regimen with either a daily or alternate-day glucocorticoid treatment program is to decrease the dose every two weeks by 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> until the dose is &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> or &le;30 mg every other day, at which point the dose reduction is slowed to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every two weeks. With doses &le;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> tapering is often further slowed to 2 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every two weeks.</p><p>Attention to symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency is important for patients who have been exposed to daily glucocorticoids for longer than three weeks, particularly those taking the dose equivalent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. However, adrenal testing is seldom needed.</p><p>The risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency due to glucocorticoid therapy and tapering is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Azathioprine is often given in divided doses to reduce gastrointestinal side effects, but it can be given as a single daily dose. The most common adverse effect with azathioprine is a reversible flu-like illness with fever, nausea, vomiting, and malaise. Less common serious adverse effects include infection, hepatotoxicity, and dose-related bone marrow suppression with leukopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and side effects of azathioprine when used in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> may be substituted in patients who do not tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The standard adult dose is 1000 mg twice a day on an empty stomach, but doses up to 1500 mg twice a day are occasionally used. Side effects are generally few with mycophenolate. The most common adverse side effects are gastrointestinal, mostly nausea or diarrhea. Leukopenia can occur, but rarely to the degree that warrants discontinuation. </p><p>Although efficacy has not been well documented, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or the combination of IVIG and an oral immunosuppressive agent would be reasonable in patients with LEMS that is refractory to the more established agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Hypertension and nephrotoxicity are the most common limiting adverse effects of cyclosporine. Other adverse effects include tremor, nausea, gingival hyperplasia, myalgias and flu-like symptoms, and hypertrichosis. The risk of malignancy, primarily squamous cell skin cancer and lymphoma, may be increased with long-term use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878355138\"><span class=\"h3\">Rituximab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In retrospective case reports, treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was associated with improvement in a few patients with LEMS who had previously been treated with multiple other immunosuppressive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

However, patients with LEMS do not respond as rapidly to plasma exchange as do those with MG. In addition, the benefit of plasma exchange is only short term, due to continued production of the offending antibodies, and repeated treatment is necessary. Nevertheless, combined therapy with plasma exchange and oral immunosuppressive agents remains a beneficial approach for some refractory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45</a>].</p><p>There are inadequate data to determine the best plasma exchange treatment protocol for LEMS. Five exchanges (3 to 5 L of plasma each) over 7 to 14 days is the typical course of treatment for MG, and this represents a reasonable protocol for patients with LEMS, given the pathogenic similarities between the two disorders. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence suggests that more than five exchanges may be necessary to achieve maximum improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The utility of plasma exchange is limited for many patients by several factors, including the need for vascular access, the limited availability of the procedure in many geographic areas, and the high cost of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3661787963\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of LEMS differs between paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic LEMS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2332397394\"><span class=\"h2\">Paraneoplastic LEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survival is usually shortened in paraneoplastic LEMS due to progression of the underlying neoplasm, which is typically small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The most important prognostic factor in patients with SCLC is the extent of disease (stage) at presentation, as reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer&quot;, section on 'SCLC'</a>.)</p><p>There is some evidence that the presence of LEMS is associated with longer survival in patients with SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,46-48</a>].
