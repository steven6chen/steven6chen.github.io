For reasons that are not well understood, proteinuria (protein in the urine) occurs in some people while standing or sitting, but not while lying down. This is called orthostatic proteinuria.</p><p>Orthostatic proteinuria is a harmless condition that can occur in young people. Generally, no further testing or treatment is necessary after diagnosis. More detailed information about orthostatic proteinuria is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthostatic-postural-proteinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthostatic (postural) proteinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will need to collect all of your urine for 24 hours. Pick a day when this would be convenient. Men may want to buy an inexpensive urinal for easy collection; women may buy an inexpensive urine hat, which fits over the toilet.</p><p>You will also need two jugs and a funnel, which will usually be provided by your doctor. Label the two jugs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daytime urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nighttime urine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perform the following steps on the day that you are going to collect the urine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When you first get up, urinate and throw away this urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the rest of the day, collect all of the urine each time you go to the bathroom. Put this urine into the daytime urine jug. You can do your normal daily activities, but strenuous exercise should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the evening, lie down two hours before you go to sleep. Just before sleeping, go to the bathroom for the last time and add this urine to the daytime jug. Lying down for two hours helps to avoid mixing urine made at night with urine made during the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you need to go to the bathroom during the night, be sure to collect this urine and put it in the nighttime urine jug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The next morning (approximately eight hours after going to sleep), collect the first morning urine and put in the nighttime urine jug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the two jugs to the laboratory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory will measure the urine protein from the daytime and from the nighttime to see if proteinuria is occurring all of the time or only during the day.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse's office will notify you when the results are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4422\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
