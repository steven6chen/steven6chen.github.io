It is also an important tool in the evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), both for correct placement of pH electrodes and as an essential part of preoperative evaluation prior to antireflux procedures.</p><p>High resolution manometry (HRM) with esophageal pressure topography (EPT) plotting combines improvements in pressure sensing technology with a greatly increased number of pressure sensors and an analysis paradigm that displays data as a topographic plot that morphs anatomy and physiology.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the critical features that distinguish HRM with EPT from conventional manometry, novel metrics for EPT, a classification scheme of motility disorders developed for EPT (Chicago Classification [CC]), and will detail the diagnostic criteria within this classification scheme. The indications for motility testing, technical aspects of conventional manometry, and the clinical manifestations and management of specific motility disorders are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;, section on 'Esophagus'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to conventional manometry where sensors are spaced at 3 to 5 cm intervals, in HRM sensors are typically spaced 1 cm apart along the length of the manometric assembly. Catheters with up to 36 sensors distributed longitudinally and radially in the esophagus allow for simultaneous pressure readings spanning both sphincters and the interposed esophagus.</p><p>Esophageal pressure topography (EPT) is a three-dimensional plotting format devised for depiction of HRM studies. EPT interpolates pressure values between sensors to create a pressure continuum. Pressure magnitude is converted into a color scale using cold colors to denote low pressures and hot colors to denote higher pressures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86104 \">figure 1</a>). In an EPT plot, time and location within the esophagus are continuous variables and pressure magnitude is indicated at each x-y coordinate by color. The result is a seamless isobaric contour (IBC) map spanning from above the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) to below the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). This also allows for the depiction of real-time luminal pressure gradients and spatial transition points of contraction amplitude or propagation velocity along the esophagus that correlate with anatomical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physiological landmarks.</p><p>Both EPT analysis and conventional manometry aim to characterize peristalsis and EGJ function. However, the types of measurements obtained differ substantially. Several novel metrics and nomenclature have been devised specifically to quantify esophageal function in EPT. (See <a href=\"#H22510787\" class=\"local\">'Analysis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22510878\" class=\"local\">'Classification of motility disorders by esophageal pressure topography (EPT)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510766\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technical aspects of performing HRM studies mirror those of conventional manometry in terms of preprocedure patient preparation and transnasal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;, section on 'Esophagus'</a>.)</p><p>In HRM, once the manometric catheter is positioned across the EGJ, no further repositioning is required. Simultaneous assessment of sphincters and body with a single series of swallows is possible with the catheter in a single, fixed position. This is in contrast to conventional manometry where pull-though maneuvers and repeated catheter repositioning are required to separately assess the sphincters and different esophageal regions.</p><p>The data acquisition period with HRM also tends to be shorter than with conventional manometry, possibly increasing study acceptability and tolerability among patients.</p><p>Similar to conventional manometry, HRM is not dependent on any specific hardware and can be accomplished with different pressure transduction technologies such as water-perfused systems, solid state strain gauge devices, or Tact-array technology. However, as performance characteristics of each pressure transduction technology are unique, HRM requires its own set of reference values developed for each specific system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26170539\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications to perform HRM are the same as those described for conventional manometry and include the evaluation of dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), noncardiac chest pain, or systemic diseases affecting smooth muscle or the autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Therefore, when available, HRM is the preferred manometric technique for the assessment of motility.

However, the types of measurements obtained differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The HRM metrics utilized in EPT to define esophageal motor function and the corresponding measures in conventional manometry are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86119 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22024797\"><span class=\"h3\">Pressure topography landmarks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPT plots have several stereotypic features reflective of unique features of esophageal anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology that are crucial to the accurate interpretation of these studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510801\"><span class=\"h4\">Anatomic sphincters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The upper and lower esophageal sphincters are usually easily visualized with EPT. Sphincter margins are characterized by an abrupt change in pressure along the luminal axis where a distinct high-pressure zone or pressure band can be identified. These high-pressure zones, together with sphincter relaxation with swallowing, allow for easy localization of the esophageal sphincters.</p><p>The EGJ is subject to substantial morphological variability in EPT plots largely due to potential laxity in the attachment between the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the crural diaphragm (CD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86107 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a completely normal EGJ (type I), the CD is directly superimposed on the LES, making it possible to identify the CD only on the basis of its inspiratory contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86107 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a type II EGJ, there is slight separation between the LES and CD, but there is no low pressure gap between the two (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86107 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a type III EGJ, there is complete separation between the LES and CD, permitting the independent assessment of either constituent.

The first contractile segment is continuous with the pharyngeal and UES contraction, while the fourth contractile segment is the LES. The second and third contractile segments, comprising most of the tubular esophagus, are not always distinct and sometimes merge as a seamless contraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510815\"><span class=\"h4\">Transition zone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A stereotypical morphologic feature of peristalsis is the major pressure trough between the first and second contractile segments, alternatively labeled the &quot;transition zone&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Physiological studies have concluded that this is the region of transition from central nervous system (CNS) control of peristalsis to enteric nervous system (myenteric plexus) control. Transition zone defects may be related to dysphagia in a small percentage of patients (&lt;4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510822\"><span class=\"h4\">Contractile deceleration point (CDP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conduction velocity, a defining feature of an esophageal contraction, is measured on EPT by the slope of the 30 mmHg IBC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86108 \">figure 3</a>). Conduction velocity is not constant along the length of the esophagus and is more rapid proximally than distally. Physiological studies have demonstrated that the transition from rapid to slow propagation correlates with the formation of the phrenic ampulla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86108 \">figure 3</a>), a transient structure composed of the effaced, elongated, and elevated LES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The contraction deceleration point (CDP) demarcates the proximal region in which the conduction (peristaltic) velocity is fast from the distal region where propagation is slow, reflecting the progression of ampullary emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The CDP location is determined on EPT plots by defining the intersection point between two tangent lines of the 30 mmHg isobaric contour: one extending distally from the transition zone and the other extending proximally from the EGJ when it reestablishes its normal postdeglutitive position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86108 \">figure 3</a>). An added criterion is that the CDP is localized within 3 cm of the proximal margin of the EGJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510829\"><span class=\"h3\">Novel EPT metrics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several novel metrics and nomenclature have been devised specifically to quantify esophageal function in esophageal pressure topography (EPT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86119 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510836\"><span class=\"h4\">Integrated relaxation pressure (IRP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IRP is a measure for assessing the adequacy of EGJ relaxation with swallowing.</p><p>Abnormal deglutitive LES relaxation is the most fundamental abnormality of esophageal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, using intraluminal manometry, LES pressure cannot be distinguished from other contributions to intraluminal pressure at the level of the EGJ, most notably, the CD. Additionally, outflow obstruction caused by stenosis or extrinsic compression can lead to elevated intrabolus pressure that is indistinguishable from impaired LES relaxation. Consequently, the metric developed to distinguish normal from impaired EGJ relaxation was termed the IRP.</p><p>IRP is defined as the average minimum EGJ pressure for four seconds of relaxation (contiguous or noncontiguous) within 10 seconds of swallowing (upper sphincter relaxation).</p><p>The IRP is a complex metric as it involves localizing the margins of the EGJ, demarcating the time window following deglutitive upper sphincter relaxation within which EGJ relaxation will occur, applying an e-sleeve measurement within that 10-second time box (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86112 \">figure 4</a>), and then determining the four seconds during which the e-sleeve value was least. IRP is the mean pressure during those four seconds.</p><p>The published upper limit of normal for the IRP is 15 mmHg which represents the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile in a series of 75 asymptomatic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, normal values are specific for specific manometric apparatus (sensor types and arrays). Additionally, the threshold value for defining a swallow as pathologic may require some degree of latitude based on the fact the concurrent contractile pattern may affect the intrabolus pressure generated at the EGJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Depending on these mitigating factors, the upper limit of normal for the IRP can be as low as 10 mmHg or as high as 20 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510850\"><span class=\"h4\">Distal latency (DL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal latency (DL) is a measure of peristaltic timing and is dependent on the integrity of deglutitive inhibition rather than peristaltic velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. DL is defined as the interval between UES relaxation and the CDP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86108 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22510822\" class=\"local\">'Contractile deceleration point (CDP)'</a> above.)</p><p>Based on the DL, contractions are defined as premature or of normal latency. In normal subjects, the median DL is 6.2 seconds with a minimal value of 4.6 seconds, thereby establishing 4.5 seconds as the lower limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In instances of increased intrabolus pressure, trapped between the distal esophageal contraction and the EGJ, the DL should be determined at an IBC pressure exceeding EGJ pressure so as not to mistake compartmentalized esophageal pressurization for a lumen-obliterating contraction. (See <a href=\"#H22510871\" class=\"local\">'Pressurization patterns'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510864\"><span class=\"h4\">Distal contractile integral (DCI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal contractile integral (DCI) is a summary measure of the vigor of the distal esophageal contraction. The DCI is essentially a composite of the mean distal contractile amplitude, length of the distal esophagus, and contractile duration.</p><p>The DCI is measured for the segment spanning from the proximal to distal pressure troughs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A box is constructed to delineate the contractile activity relegated to the second and third contractile segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86116 \">figure 5</a>). The DCI is then calculated by summing the pressure measurements at each enclosed coordinate. To exclude the effects of vascular artifacts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrabolus pressure in the DCI computation, the first 20 mmHg is discounted. Therefore, the DCI value is greater than zero only when foci of intra-esophageal pressure exceed 20 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2532558\"><span class=\"h4\">Contraction vigor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although an ineffective contraction (meaning a contraction that did not clear a swallowed bolus from the esophagus) was originally defined in conventional manometry on the basis of low-amplitude peristalsis, this criterion was not used to define weak peristalsis in the first versions of the Chicago Classification (CC). Rather, contractions were categorized as &quot;weak&quot; because of small or large breaks in the 20-mmHg isobaric contour. Consequently, when correlating conventional line-tracing analysis with pressure topography analysis, one study found breaks in the 20 mmHg isobaric contour to be nonspecific for ineffective peristalsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. To clarify the distinction between contractile vigor and the contraction pattern, CC version 3.0 (CC-3) separates these concepts and bases the evaluation of contractile vigor entirely on the DCI, using cutoff values of 100 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm for failed peristalsis and 450 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm for weak peristalsis. The value for weak peristalsis was derived directly from the study while the threshold for failed peristalsis represented a convenient compromise between proposed values ranging from 50 to 150 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm. Both failed and weak peristaltic contractions are ineffective. At the other extreme of contractile vigor, it was accepted to keep the cutoff for hypercontractility at 8000 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm but to eliminate the &quot;hypertensive&quot; designation for contractions with DCI between 5000 and 8000 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm because it has no apparent clinical significance.</p><p>Contraction vigor based on DCI values are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failed peristalsis &ndash; DCI &lt;100 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak peristalsis &ndash; DCI &gt;100 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm, but &lt;450 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ineffective &ndash; Failed or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal &ndash; DCI &gt;450 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm but &lt;8000 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercontractile &ndash;DCI &gt;8000 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm</p><p/><p>With respect to hypercontractility, there are instances in which this phenomenon involves the LES as well as the second and third contractile segments, and others in which it seemingly only involves the LES (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98362\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98362 \">figure 6</a>). Excluding the LES from the measurement domain in such cases might then fail to detect the abnormality; hence, in the CC-3 it was decided to incorporate the LES into the DCI measurement domain in these instances and to use the existing cutoff value (8000 mmHg) to define hypercontractility. It was reasoned that the degree to which the LES pressure normally exceeds 20 mmHg is sufficiently slight such that its &quot;normal&quot; contribution to the DCI would be trivial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26171204\"><span class=\"h4\">Contraction pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irregularities in the contraction pattern characterized by breaks in the 20 mmHg isobaric contour <strong>but not ineffective</strong><em> </em>define &quot;fragmented peristalsis.&quot; However, since small breaks (&lt;3 cm) in the 20 mmHg isobaric contour are frequently encountered in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], putting them within the realm of normal, it requires large breaks (&gt;5 cm) in the 20-mmHg isobaric contour to meet this definition. Larger breaks are significantly more common in patients with dysphagia than in controls (14 versus 4 percent ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Hence, fragmented contractions are defined as contractions with a large break in the 20 mmHg isobaric contour, but normal or elevated DCI (&gt;450 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Similarly, a premature contraction must have both a DL &lt;4.5 seconds and a DCI &gt;450 mmHg&middot;s&middot;cm to qualify; otherwise it would be considered failed and fall under the category of &quot;ineffective contractions.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510871\"><span class=\"h4\">Pressurization patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distinction between an esophageal contraction and pressurization is that while a contraction signifies a lumen-obliterating squeeze of the circular muscle clamping down on the pressure recording device, pressurization is recorded within an open lumen; for example, between the closed upper and lower sphincters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In EPT, pressurization is evident by straight, vertical bands of increased pressure &quot;blocked&quot; at either end by a greater, obstructing pressure.</p><p>When pressurization involves the entire esophagus, it is termed as &quot;panesophageal pressurization&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86117 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This pattern is pathognomonic for type II achalasia. (See <a href=\"#H22510922\" class=\"local\">'Achalasia'</a> below.). A more limited region of pressurization, termed &quot;compartmentalized pressurization,&quot; can occur between an esophageal contraction and the EGJ in the setting of hiatus hernia, a CD contraction, after fundoplication surgery, or after bariatric surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86117 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Proximal compartmentalized pressurization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86117 \">figure 7</a>) can also occur in the setting of isolated, nonperistaltic distal esophageal contractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22510878\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF MOTILITY DISORDERS BY ESOPHAGEAL PRESSURE TOPOGRAPHY (EPT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Chicago Classification (CC, now in version 3.0 [CC-3]) of esophageal motility is an algorithmic scheme for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders from clinical esophageal pressure topography (EPT) studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-manometry/abstract/8,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30,31</a>]. A key feature of the CC is the hierarchical categorization of esophageal motility disorders into conditions never seen in normal individuals and those that are defined on the basis of being statistically outside of the norm (expected in approximately 5 percent of a &quot;normal&quot; population) but not necessarily indicative of pathology.
