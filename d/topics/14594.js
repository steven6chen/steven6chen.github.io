Patients with these conditions typically have substantial impairments in personal, social and occupational functioning. </p><p>Assertive community treatment (ACT) and supported employment are psychosocial interventions developed to address functional deficits of patients with severe mental illness. ACT is a high intensity, integrated, community-based model for delivering clinical and other social services to individuals with severe mental illness. Supported employment programs provide support to individuals with severe mental illness to find and maintain a job in the competitive job market. Although their availability varies, these interventions are used to augment pharmacotherapy for severe mental disorders.</p><p>This topic addresses psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness. Psychosocial interventions specific to individual disorders are discussed separately, as are pharmacologic treatments for these disorders.

Certain personality disorders and other psychiatric disorders are sometimes included within the category of severe mental illness. Variation in the disorders included under the term is seen when the designation is used to determine eligibility for mental health care and other social services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Definitions of severe mental illness typically exclude substance use disorders (as primary disorders), dementia, and intellectual developmental disorder (formerly mental retardation in DSM-IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Even with the help of case managers coordinating services for them (eg, scheduling appointments), many patients lack the social and cognitive competence to follow-through, contributing to gaps in treatment and other services, and increasing patients&rsquo; risk of relapse. The goal of assertive community treatment (ACT) programs is to prevent relapse and hospitalization by providing comprehensive, integrated community services. ACT is not typically a psychotherapeutic intervention implemented by an independent clinician, but a set of services usually embedded in a public mental health program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988583\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend ACT for individuals with severe mental illness who have a recent history of repeated hospitalization or homelessness. ACT should also be considered for individuals with severe mental illness who are at risk for hospitalization or homelessness as evidenced by a combination of the factors below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe illness (persistently high symptoms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor insight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor compliance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Co-morbid substance abuse </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited family and other social support</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988590\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACT is a team-based program that provides clinical and care management services to patients in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patient behaviors targeted by ACT programs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining a safe residence in the community</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compliance with antipsychotic and other prescribed medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal utilization of (or need for) emergency psychiatric and medical services</p><p/><p>To achieve these goals, the ACT model has incorporated numerous specialized features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multidisciplinary team that includes case managers, a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, and occupational therapist, as well as access to a pharmacist, primary care physician, and legal advocate as necessary. Team members meet weekly to discuss patients under their care. ACT teams are based on the principle of shared responsibility for each patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Team members provide services directly to the patient. Outreach and, if necessary, clinical services are provided in the community. As an example, if the patient does not show up at the clinic for a scheduled medication appointment, a team member would visit the patient where he or she lives. Services are available, as needed, 24 hours per day, seven days a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The case manager functions as the patient&rsquo;s principal resource. To increase effectiveness, the ACT model specifies a ratio of case managers to patients of 1:12 and continuity of care with the same case manager to the extent feasible. Frequent interactions between the patient and the ACT team are emphasized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The case manager&rsquo;s role varies across patients and their needs over time, but may include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bringing medications to the home</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Taking the patient to appointments</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Providing skills training in the community (eg, learning to ride the bus) (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-schizophrenia#H13622373\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia&quot;, section on 'Social skills training'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients are not typically enrolled in ACT programs for a specific length of time. Continued participation is based on the patient&rsquo;s status. Once he or she demonstrates consistent treatment adherence, the level of care can be gradually decreased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988597\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of six randomized trials for homeless patients with serious mental illness found ACT led to a 37 percent greater reduction in homelessness and a 26 percent greater improvement in psychiatric symptoms compared to standard case management treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review of randomized trials for patients with severe mental illness and a history of repeated hospitalization found that ACT led to a reduction in the number of days hospitalized relative to those receiving standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Individuals assigned to ACT used fewer emergency services and more outpatient services, including financial and housing assistance, relative to individuals receiving standard care. ACT appears to be most effective for patients with high rates of hospitalization.</p><p>Most studies of ACT have failed to find improvement in competitive employment, social functioning, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Tested as a multi-modal intervention, it is not known which elements of ACT are responsible for the reductions in relapse and hospitalization. </p><p>Since ACT was first defined, a series of similar programs (sometimes collectively referred to as Intensive Case Management) have been developed with differing emphases among the component parts. ACT is by far the best studied model among these programs. &#160;Comparative trials of these programs are lacking. However, programs with greater fidelity to the ACT model have achieved lower rates of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988831\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of individuals with severe mental illness, less than 20 percent have been estimated to be competitively employed (ie, to have jobs in the competitive job market) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Traditional approaches to vocational rehabilitation in this population have emphasized sheltered employment, such as a job in an entity (eg, a store or a factory) owned by a rehabilitation agency. More recent approaches such as supported employment have emphasized improving patients&rsquo; abilities to find and maintain employment in the competitive job market.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988838\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with severe mental disorders want to work.

The work coach helps the patient find a store with job openings and assists him with the application. Obtaining support from the store manager, the work coach provides daily on-site training until the patient learns the skills to complete all necessary tasks. Within days, the patient starts working independently with on-site support initially several days per week. Over time, the work coach&rsquo;s role is reduced to contact once or twice per month. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1988859\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials found supported employment to be more effective than pre-vocational training (a more traditional rehabilitative approach) in enabling individuals with severe mental illness to achieve competitive employment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At 18 months, more individuals who received supported employment were employed than individuals who received pre-vocational training (34 versus 12 percent), with a need to treat 4.5 patients to yield one with benefit. Individuals in the supported employment group earned more and worked more hours per month compared to the pre-vocational training group.</p><p>Supported employment programs that incorporate most or all of the key components described above were found to be more effective than those with fewer of the components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Supported employment has not been found to increase stress, exacerbate symptoms, or result in other negative clinical outcomes. Individual components of the supported employment model have not been found to improve employment outcomes, with the exception of integration of vocational services and mental health services, which is associated with increased employment rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-severe-mental-illness/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
