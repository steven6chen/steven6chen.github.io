However, in clinical practice, the vast majority of women who undergo genetic testing do not have a mutation in either one of these genes.</p><p>Genetic analysis is performed at various commercial laboratories nationally and internationally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since 2013, when the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated key patents on <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> held by a commercial company, more testing options have become available. In addition to <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> tests, next-generation sequencing (NGS) multigene panels are also available to evaluate a wider array of potential mutations that might predispose to breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancer.</p><p>For patients who meet criteria for genetic testing (and those who desire genetic testing), expertise is required to ensure that the test will be adequately interpreted and that the results will aid in diagnosis or influence management of the patient or family members at risk for hereditary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The complexity involved in pre- and post-test risk assessment underscores the importance of genetic counseling both before and after testing.</p><p>This topic reviews the genetic testing and the interpretation of genetic tests for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome suspected as being associated with mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3090108380\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR GENETIC RISK EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While unaffected women often present with concerns about their hereditary cancer risk, whenever possible, it is ideal to initiate genetic testing in a family member who is most likely to test positive for a mutation, which is usually a woman affected by early breast cancer or ovarian cancer (any age). Most hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (HBOC) are due to highly penetrant germline <em>BRCA</em> mutations, which are inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Data regarding clinical characteristics associated with BRCA mutations are discussed elsewhere (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks#H745070007\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and associated cancer risks&quot;, section on 'Clinical characteristics associated with BRCA mutations'</a>.)</p><p>Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors provide detailed criteria for identifying candidates for genetic counseling and possible testing for HBOC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. NCCN guidelines are updated at least annually based on evidence-based reviews of published studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107534 \">table 1</a>).

Given the complexity of genetic testing options and their interpretation, pre-and post-test genetic counseling is critical.</p><p>Although psychosocial concerns may deter some high-risk individuals from genetic testing, studies have demonstrated no evidence of major risks for psychological dysfunction in those who pursue testing, including those who test positive for a <em>BRCA</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Therefore, high-risk patients should be encouraged to proceed with testing, particularly if their or their relatives' medical management is likely to be altered by a positive result. High-risk individuals who decline genetic testing should be offered referral to (or ongoing) genetic counseling, access to information regarding genetic testing, and psychological support if they are anxious or distressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Even if they ultimately do not proceed with testing, these individuals should be assessed by their primary care providers for signs of psychological distress, and should receive individualized guidelines for cancer surveillance and risk reduction based on their personal and family history.</p><p>Further information about genetic counseling is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21695000\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-test counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of pre-test counseling is to provide an individual with a genetic risk assessment based on their personal and family history, and to discuss the options for and implications of genetic testing. Mathematical models may be used to provide patients with estimates of cancer risks and the likelihood of testing positive for a gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

It also provides them with information needed to understand the potential impact the test results may have for themselves and their relatives. Particularly with the advent of next-generation multigene panel testing, appropriate pre-test genetic counseling is critical. &#160; </p><p>Pre-test counseling generally occurs in-person; however, telephone counseling and various adjuncts for counseling (including electronic-based <span class=\"nowrap\">educational/decision</span> aids) may be used as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Specifically, two large randomized studies of telephone versus in-person pre- and post-test <em>BRCA</em> genetic counseling showed that the two methods of service delivery are equally safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although telephone genetic counseling expands access to this service, the uptake of genetic testing has been found to be somewhat lower in women who undergo telephone counseling; however, the reasons for this are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Moreover, it is important to assess individuals for distress or anxiety, as certain individuals may be better served by in-person pre- and post-test counseling whenever possible.</p><p>The following are components of pre-test counseling:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21695234\"><span class=\"h3\">Pedigree evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important component of pre-test counseling is a detailed review of the patient's past medical history and family history, which should include information on maternal and paternal relatives, preferably covering at least three generations. This process is key to determining not only which individuals should undergo genetic counseling, but also is instrumental in ordering the right test and counseling the patient about the rationale for testing and the likelihood of obtaining a positive result. In rare instances, the pedigree will reveal the presence of a rare hereditary cancer syndrome for which specific genetic testing may be indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks#H1039353363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and associated cancer risks&quot;, section on 'Cancer risks in BRCA mutation carriers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954842383\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk assessment models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to ascertain the likelihood an individual will test positive for a cancer susceptibility gene mutation, a number of mathematical models have been developed. In addition to assessing pre-test mutation carrier probability, these quantitative models also estimate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. Most of these models assume correctly that the majority of hereditary <span class=\"nowrap\">breast/ovarian</span> cancer cases are attributable to <em>BRCA</em> mutations, and none provide probabilities about the chance of testing positive for a moderate-risk gene mutation. Because mathematical models may underestimate the likelihood that an individual will test positive for a cancer susceptibility gene mutation and are somewhat cumbersome to utilize in a traditional clinic setting, we often recommend using National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) qualitative criteria to identify appropriate candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the mathematical models may be very helpful in the following scenarios to provide:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast (and possibly ovarian) cancer risks for women who are low-risk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who decline genetic testing.

Moreover, several commercial labs cap patient out-of-pocket costs (minus a deductible) if testing is covered by insurance. A letter of medical necessity may be required to document the potential impact of a positive test result on surveillance or surgical recommendations for an individual. For patients without insurance, financial assistance programs exist through many labs, but the out-of-pocket costs can still be prohibitive. In these cases, testing a family member first may prove useful. If a mutation is identified, testing relatives for the single mutation is a few hundred as opposed to a few thousand dollars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic discrimination &ndash;</strong> One of the primary sources of concern about potential harm in patients undergoing genetic testing stems from their fear of genetic discrimination, which can be a common reason for declining genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Fortunately, within the United States, federal and state laws provide many protections against genetic discrimination, which is reassuring to many concerned patients. These protections are provided primarily through the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination (GINA) Act and the Affordable Care Act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There are loopholes in these laws, however, about which patients should be aware. Additional information on genetic discrimination and legal protection is discussed elsewhere.

The interpretation and medical implications of the test result is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevalence-of-brca1-and-brca2-mutations-and-associated-cancer-risks#H1039353363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and associated cancer risks&quot;, section on 'Cancer risks in BRCA mutation carriers'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>An important component of post-test counseling is to inform patients and their family members of the implications of the test result, identify at-risk individuals based upon the pedigree structure, and encourage sharing of this information with relatives. In addition, patients should be provided with information for their relatives (eg, copies of test result and information on how to find a genetic counselor). Finally, they should stipulate when, if ever, they would disclose results without patient consent.</p><p>Clinicians should document that patients are informed about who in their family is at risk for hereditary cancer and what the potential implications are. In addition, providers should be aware that a patient may refuse to voluntarily disclose results, which may raise professional conflicts between two competing ethical obligations: the duty to protect patient privacy and autonomy versus the duty to disclose for the purpose of preventing future harm. Until such time as clear legal obligations are defined, clinicians should consult with medical geneticists, genetic counselors, lawyers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bioethicists in the event that patients do not provide consent to share information. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H4404316\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Disclosure to family members'</a>.)</p><p>In some families, such disclosure may result in discord among relatives, while in other cases, relatives may be quite receptive to the information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Nevertheless, studies of family disclosure have found that most individuals, carriers and non-carriers, do share their test results with at-risk relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].

The <em>BRCA</em> genes are large, and hundreds of different mutations have been identified. As a result, complete analysis of the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes to exclude both known (ie, relatively common) and novel (or rare) mutations is often desired, and this testing is expensive (ranging from 1500 to 4000 dollars in the United States). The standard of care in laboratory assessment for mutations in these genes involves comprehensive sequencing and testing for rare gene rearrangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/19,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,36</a>]. If patients have a relative who has tested positive for a deleterious mutation, targeted (single-site) mutational analysis can be performed, which is much less expensive compared with comprehensive testing.</p><p>Because of the high background frequency of founder mutations, relatives of an individual with a founder mutation are usually tested not just for the familial mutation, but also for the other founder mutations as well.

These LR are large gene deletions or duplications, which comprise at least 6 percent of all deleterious <em>BRCA1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>BRCA2</em></span> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Prior to 2006, testing for these LRs was infrequent. The scope of this problem is illustrated by one analysis of 48,466 individuals from diverse risk and ethnic groups, which found that 23.8 percent of individuals with personal and family histories of cancer conferring high pre-test mutation carrier probabilities harbored LR mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The largest studies reporting on the outcomes of multigene testing indicate that among women tested in clinical settings, about 5 to 10 percent have a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation, and about 4 to 7 percent have a harmful mutation in another gene associated with high to moderate risks of breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancer, or a mutation in a newer gene that may also be associated with increased risks for these cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].

After limited testing does not reveal a mutation, (eg, in <em>BRCA1 </em>and <em>BRCA2</em>), some labs also offer the option of &quot;reflexing&quot; to a high-risk or extended multigene panel test. This approach to testing can be cost-effective for those who choose to pursue it, but the overall yield is low. There are many factors we consider when choosing the extent of testing we offer a patient, as well as which lab to use, including cost, turnaround time, reliability of the lab, and ease of test ordering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Although the mutations evaluated by multigene panels are uncommon and even rare, individuals must be prepared for the possibility that a high-penetrance mutation may be identified even in the absence of a classic presentation of the associated syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

Some deleterious mutations are unique to individual families, whereas others have been reported in several different families.</p><p>The cancer risks and management of individuals found to carry a deleterious mutation is discussed elsewhere.

For women with a true negative <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em></span> test result, the risks of breast and ovarian cancer are usually similar to general population risks, provided that, if there is a mutation within the family, there is no significant family history of cancer on the noncarrier side of the family and no other major risk factors for these cancers (eg, atypical hyperplasia). It is not unusual for patients who test negative for a known familial mutation to feel a degree of &quot;survivor guilt&quot; for being spared what other relatives have to endure. However, overall, studies suggest that women who test negative for a familial mutation experience significant declines in distress (ie, depression, anxiety, cancer worry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>A true negative result in a woman from a family with a known <em>BRCA</em> mutation has significant implications, since these individuals can usually be reassured that their cancer risks are much lower than they would be if they had inherited the mutation. Although controversial, some studies have suggested that the risk of developing breast cancer may still be elevated as compared with the general population risk, owing to other shared genetic, environmental, or reproductive risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. However, because these data are inconsistent, women are generally counseled that their risk is the same as the general population. The risk estimates, however, may be modified based upon other risk factors, such as suggestive family history of the noncarrier parent and traditional reproductive risk factors. None of the quantitative risk models such as Tyrer-Cuzick or the National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT, Gail model 2) have been validated for use in such instances.</p><p>While interpretation of a negative test result for families that harbor a high-penetrance gene is well defined, it is less clear how to interpret negative test results in families with a moderate-risk gene such as <em>CHEK2</em>, or newly identified mutations in rare genes such as <em>RAD50. </em>In these families, it is often not possible to know whether the mutation identified segregates with the cancers in the family or whether other gene mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be contributing to increased cancer risks. Thus, in families with these types of gene mutations, genetic testing in at-risk individuals may not provide a definitive answer about cancer risk or management. Whether further testing is indicated depends on the situation and the individual's risk, as well as which test was done.

For patients who were tested only for <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em></span> mutations in the past, additional genetic counseling and testing may be advisable. Genetic counseling can help patients consider the potential benefits of different testing options, as well as their potential limitations and financial costs.

For example, many individuals of Ashkenazi (Central or Eastern European) Jewish descent undergo testing only for the three recurring founder mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>. When they test negative, possible explanations for this type of result include the presence of a mutation that was not assessed or a mutation in another gene. Or, in a Jewish breast cancer patient for example, her result could mean she is a phenocopy (ie, developed sporadic cancer in an otherwise hereditary cancer family). (See <a href=\"#H373721129\" class=\"local\">'Phenocopy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although between 7 and 13 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals carry a non-founder <em>BRCA</em> mutation, it is more likely that high-risk individuals in particular will test positive for a high to moderate-risk gene on a panel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the frequency of mutations in other genes associated with hereditary breast cancer for Ashkenazi Jews has not been established. To determine if additional genetic testing is indicated, individuals should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Options include comprehensive <em>BRCA</em> analysis and next-generation panel testing. We tend to recommend the latter. However, because of the high frequency of founder mutations in Ashkenazi Jews, it is still possible that a <em>BRCA</em> mutation is present in a family even after the first person tested in the family (ie, the proband) tests negative. Thus, in some such families, we may recommend <em>BRCA</em> founder mutation testing to an unaffected relative before proceeding with panel testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multigene panel testing negative &ndash;</strong> In the clinical setting of a suspected inherited susceptibility to breast or ovarian cancer and no deleterious mutation is identified by either comprehensive <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em></span> or multigene panel testing, a mutation may still exist in an unknown susceptibility gene that could possibly be detected with whole-exome or genome sequencing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in clinical practice, we rarely recommend testing beyond multigene panels due the limited yield of such testing.

The online version of the Gail model ascertains <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em></span> test results but does not factor them into the calculations. Although the Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick models consider nongenetic risk factors such as age at menarche, first term birth, and biopsy history (and other factors in Tyrer-Cuzick, such as height and weight, age at menopause, etc), of the two, only Tyrer-Cuzick considers a family history of breast and ovarian cancer beyond first-degree relatives. Although breast density has been incorporated into some versions of the Gail model (ie, breast cancer surveillance consortium risk calculator) to predict five-year breast cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/26,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,64</a>], these risks have not been well validated. Breast density, particularly in younger women, should be considered when assessing overall risk and in designing management strategies for high-risk women.</p><p>All models make assumptions about the genetic etiology of breast cancer. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BRCAPRO assumes that <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em></span> mutations account for all hereditary breast and ovarian cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. In the highest-risk families (eg, with multiple cases of ovarian cancer and early breast cancer), the model may generate high residual risks for carrying a <em>BRCA</em> mutation, and thus high risks for primary or contralateral breast cancer and ovarian cancer even with a negative result. However, many of these individuals will likely pursue multigene panel testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tyrer-Cuzick considers the contributions of other low-penetrance genes to breast cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, within the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab) familial breast cancer resource of 822 high-risk families, high risks predicted by the Tyrer-Cuzick model correlated closely with breast cancer risks in <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em>-positive</span> families, but were less evident in families in whom no such mutation was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p>In our practice, we often use the BRCAPRO and Tyrer-Cuzick models to provide a range of breast cancer risks. Because of the assumptions underlying the BRCAPRO model, after an uninformative <em>BRCA</em> test, the model often predicts average to slightly elevated breast cancer risks. On the other hand, although the Tyrer-Cuzick model is well-validated, in our experience, the predicted risks are often much higher than other quantitative models, as has been reported elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]; thus, these estimates need to be interpreted on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954844387\"><span class=\"h3\">Personal history of breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All breast cancer survivors have an elevated risk of developing a second primary contralateral (CBC) or ipsilateral (IBC) breast cancer.

This is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective, multicenter study that included 6235 affected women from high-risk families found that the rate of CBC after 25 years of follow-up for <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em>-negative</span> (n = 4501), <em>BRCA1</em>-positive (n = 1154), and <em>BRCA2</em>-positive (n = 575) was 17.2 percent (95% CI 14.5-19.9), 44.1 percent (95% CI 37.6-50.6), and 33.5 percent (95% CI 22.4-44.7), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In addition, CBC risks in <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em>-negative</span> women were highly influenced by age at diagnosis. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women diagnosed under age 40 years, the 10 and 25-year cumulative risks of CBC were 10.6 percent (95% CI 6.8-14.4) and 28.4 percent (95% CI 20.5-36.3), respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, for women diagnosed at age 50 or older, the 10-year risk was 5.5 percent (95% CI 4.3-6.7) and the 25-year risk was 12.9 percent (95% CI 8.9-17.0).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon a population-based case-control study that included <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA</em>2-negative</span> women (n = 594 with CBC and n = 1119 controls with unilateral breast cancer), patients diagnosed before age 45 with a first-degree relative diagnosed at a similarly young age had a relative risk (RR) of 2.5 for CBC (95% CI 1.1-5.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

This is comparable to <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2 </em>carriers, whose risk was 18.4 percent (95% CI 16.0-21.3). Of note, at least 30 percent of the women in this study used adjuvant endocrine therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>), which may have impacted the subsequent incidence of CBC reported.</p><p/><p>The cumulative risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>] may provide useful information for counseling about CBC risk in <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em>-negative</span> women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 55. While models such as BRCAPRO and BOADICEA can generate estimates of CBC risk in <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em>-negative</span> women, these tools have not been validated for CBC risk assessment. Nevertheless, we do run the BRCAPRO model and compare it with the data above to give patients a sense about their level of risk for a CBC. Of note, BRCAPRO was recently recalibrated to factor in histories of CBC in predicting <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRCA1/BRCA2</em></span> mutation carrier probability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Although unselected women with a prior history of breast cancer had a reported slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], most of that risk can be attributed to hereditary factors, namely <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2 </em>mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. When <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> mutations have been excluded in families with breast cancer but no family member has ovarian cancer, and in which there is no suspicion of other syndromes, such as Lynch syndrome, there does not appear to be an increased risk of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/56,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,77,78</a>].

Based upon a prospective study that included 8005 women (without personal history of ovarian cancer or oophorectomy) from 895 families, the risk of ovarian cancer for women who tested negative for a <em>BRCA1 </em>or <em>BRCA2 </em>mutation (n = 1613) was equivalent to population levels (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.45-1.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>When women have tested negative for mutations in multiple other genes that may be associated with breast cancer and elevated risks of ovarian cancer (such as the Lynch syndrome genes, <em>TP53</em>, <em>BRIP1</em>, <em>RAD51C</em>, and <em>RAD51D</em>), there is even less concern about ovarian cancer risks in the absence of a family history of ovarian cancer.

However, in clinical practice, the vast majority of women who undergo genetic testing do not have a mutation in either one of these genes. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whenever possible, all patients who are candidates for genetic testing should be referred to a credentialed genetics provider, such as a board-certified genetic counselor. Given the complexity of genetic testing options and their interpretation, pre-and post-test genetic counseling is critical. (See <a href=\"#H13934518\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who meet criteria for genetic testing (and those who desire genetic testing), expertise is required to ensure that the test will be adequately interpreted and to determine if the results will aid in diagnosis or influence management of the patient or family members at risk for hereditary cancer. It is important to counsel all patients about the testing options, costs, and possible <span class=\"nowrap\">advantages/disadvantages</span> to additional testing. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Options for genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women of a specific ancestry, testing may be limited to assessment of founder or recurring mutations, particularly for those of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, since the vast majority of Ashkenazi Jews with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation will have one of three founder mutations. (See <a href=\"#H373719289\" class=\"local\">'BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who previously underwent <em>BRCA</em> testing without analysis for large genomic rearrangements (LR) should be counseled regarding the chance that they may harbor one of these mutations. (See <a href=\"#H373719295\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of large genomic rearrangements in BRCA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We offer many patients whose histories are consistent with hereditary <span class=\"nowrap\">breast/ovarian</span> cancer the option of pursuing panel testing as first-line testing, particularly when there are other cancer types in the family, one or more rare syndromes in the differential, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the results would influence medical management. (See <a href=\"#H373719418\" class=\"local\">'Next-generation panel testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> or other gene alteration is identified but its clinical significance is unclear, this is termed a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). In this instance, it is unclear if the variant is an undefined deleterious mutation, a benign polymorphism (ie, normal change in the gene), or variant with an intermediate risk of cancer. Such a result is also considered to be uninformative.
