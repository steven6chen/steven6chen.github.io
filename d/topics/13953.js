Most women with postpartum depression start having symptoms within a month after giving birth. But it can be up to 12 months before a woman starts having symptoms.</p><p>Depression can make you feel sad, down, hopeless, or cranky most of the day, almost every day. Another common sign of depression is no longer enjoying or caring about things you used to like to do.</p><p>After having a baby, many women get a mild type of postpartum depression called postpartum blues. Within 2 or 3 days after giving birth, women with postpartum blues might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be moody, irritable, or anxious</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble concentrating or sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have crying spells</p><p/><p>In women with postpartum blues, these symptoms are not severe and usually go away within 2 weeks. But in women with postpartum depression, the symptoms are more severe and last longer.</p><p>Women who have a history of depression are more likely to get postpartum depression than women who have never been depressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515624\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of postpartum depression?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be hard to tell if a woman has postpartum depression, since some of the symptoms might also be caused by the<strong> </strong>stress of taking care of a newborn. For example, it's normal for new mothers to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired or lack energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have changes in their appetite, weight, and desire to have sex</p><p/><p>But women with postpartum depression might not be able to sleep even when their babies sleep. Or they might have so little energy that they cannot get out of bed for hours.</p><p>They might also feel:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxious, irritable, and angry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guilty or overwhelmed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unable to care for their baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Like a failure as a mother</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515640\"><span class=\"h1\">If you want to hurt or kill yourself, see someone right away!</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you ever feel like you might want to hurt yourself or your baby, do one of these things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call your doctor or nurse and tell them it is urgent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Go to the emergency room at your local hospital</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255; <a href=\"http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/&amp;token=Or7v6ARWAbZn5SccEnrdvHwhSdzQ5/zYISwtFHqat7NV22+e2BoqmPi4HRy5AOzPaimq849SRlcl8bAuvaNl5A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16996\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515655\"><span class=\"h1\">How is postpartum depression treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments for depression can also be used to treat postpartum depression. The two main treatments for depression are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines to relieve depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking with a therapist (such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, or social worker)</p><p/><p>Women who are breastfeeding might need to avoid certain medicines. When a nursing mother takes medicine, small amounts of the medicine can be found in her breast milk. This might be unhealthy for the baby. But not treating depression can also be harmful for both the mother and her baby, and there are many medicines for depression that do not seem to harm the baby. Your doctor can help you decide if you need medicine and the best one to take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515670\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have postpartum depression once are likely to get it again. If you had postpartum depression before and took a medicine that helped you feel better, your doctor might recommend that you take that medicine again after you give birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515685\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
