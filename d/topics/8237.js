When a person's blood pressure gets very high, it can lead to problems in one or more of the following organs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes &ndash; Problems can include bleeding in the back of the eye, or swelling of the nerve that runs from the eye to the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain &ndash; Problems can include swelling or bleeding in the brain, or a stroke. A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidneys &ndash; Very high blood pressure can lead to kidney failure, which is when the kidneys stop working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart &ndash; Heart problems can include a heart attack, heart failure, or damage to a major blood vessel.</p><p/><p>When your doctor or nurse tells you your blood pressure, he or she says 2 numbers. For example, your doctor might say that your blood pressure is &quot;140 over 90.&quot; When people have a high blood pressure emergency, their blood pressure is usually &quot;180 over 120&quot; or higher.</p><p>Other terms doctors might use for a high blood pressure emergency are &quot;hypertensive emergency&quot; or &quot;malignant hypertension.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes, a person's blood pressure is much higher than normal, but it hasn't damaged any organs. Doctors call this &quot;hypertensive urgency.&quot; Hypertensive urgency is not usually treated the same as a high blood pressure emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28990110\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a high blood pressure emergency?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the organ or organs affected. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision or other vision changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out or seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can make people move or behave strangely.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or numbness on one side of the body, or in one arm or leg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty talking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the upper back or between the shoulders </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine that is brown or bloody</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the lower back or on the side of the body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28990125\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of the symptoms listed above, especially if you know that you have high blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28990140\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and check your blood pressure. He or she might use a special light to look in the back of your eyes.</p><p>Your doctor will also do tests to check how serious your condition is. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan or other imaging test of your brain &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan or other imaging test of your chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ECG (also called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28990155\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a high blood pressure emergency treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high blood pressure emergency is treated in the hospital. Your doctor will give you medicines to lower your blood pressure quickly. These medicines usually go into your vein through a tube called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>Your doctor will also treat any problems caused by your very high blood pressure, if they can be treated.</p><p>People who have a high blood pressure emergency usually need long-term treatment to keep their blood pressure under control. This usually includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following a low-salt diet that includes a lot of fruits and vegetables</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight (if you are overweight)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting regular exercise</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28990170\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-kidney-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute kidney injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-diet-and-weight-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure, diet, and weight (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
