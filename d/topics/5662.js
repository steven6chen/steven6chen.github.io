Mutations in the alpha-1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (<em>SCN1A</em>) gene are identified in 70 to 80 percent of patients with DS.</p><p>Drug resistance is a well-recognized feature of seizures in this syndrome, and antiseizure drug therapies have overall limited efficacy. Nonetheless, every effort should be made to avoid seizure triggers and to control seizures and status epilepticus as best as possible. Pharmacologic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment, and ketogenic diet and neuromodulation are viable options in selected patients.</p><p>The goals of treatment are to reduce both the length and number of seizures and prevent status epilepticus, limit adverse effects of antiseizure drugs to promote better neurocognitive development, and improve quality of life. The treatment recommendations below are generally consistent with those of a North American consensus panel on the diagnosis and management of DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The management and prognosis of DS will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of DS are reviewed separately.

We advise parents to try to avoid increases in body temperature by minimizing hot baths or excessive physical activity on warm days. &#160; </p><p>Oral or rectal antipyretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>) and prophylactic benzodiazepines may be used in the setting of fever, although prospective studies on the efficacy of prophylactic therapies for preventing seizures in patients with DS are lacking. A North American consensus panel on the diagnosis and management of DS reached strong consensus on use of antipyretics with both illness and vaccination and benzodiazepines with illness, but acknowledged limited evidence to support the practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Randomized trials of antipyretic therapy in otherwise healthy children with a history of febrile seizures have not shown any benefit compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

However, there is no compelling evidence that vaccines should be withheld or modified in patients with DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prophylactic antipyretics are commonly used at the time of vaccination and for 24 hours afterwards, although specific data on the effectiveness of this approach are lacking. </p><p>Observational data in children with DS indicate that vaccinations before or after disease onset do not affect clinical or intellectual outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. As in healthy children, the risk of post-vaccination seizure likely varies according to the type of vaccine and the age of the child and may be highest in association with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Among these, stiripentol as an add-on therapy is the only drug to be evaluated in randomized trials, but its availability is restricted or limited in many countries, including the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2186080545\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with DS require two or more drugs to achieve reasonable seizure control, and choice of drugs should be individualized based on considerations of efficacy as well as side effects, tolerability, and access.

There have been no prospective studies of valproate in patients with DS.</p><p>In a retrospective survey of 99 children with DS in Japan, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a> was the most commonly used drug and was deemed to have excellent or moderate efficacy for the prevention of status epilepticus in 8 and 45 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It was felt to have no effect in the remaining patients. A similar survey study in Europe that included 274 patients with DS found that valproate was used by 86 percent of patients, most commonly in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobazam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clobazam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stiripentol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stiripentol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Valproate</a> is typically initiated at a dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> in two or three divided doses and increased to a target or maintenance dose of 25 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> depending on achieved blood levels, efficacy, and side effects.</p><p>Potential side effects include nausea and vomiting, weight gain, sedation, hair loss, pancreatitis, hyperammonemia, and blood dyscrasias. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Valproate</a> has multiple potential interactions with concomitant antiseizure drugs and other medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53463 \">table 1</a>).

Nevertheless, when used in combination with other therapies, clobazam does seem to help control seizures in these patients and is the second most commonly used drug, after valproate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>].</p><p>When used with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stiripentol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stiripentol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobazam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clobazam</a> levels typically increase by twofold, and most patients on both drugs require a reduction in clobazam dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dravet-syndrome-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Because of this interaction, we typically measure clobazam levels before stiripentol is initiated and monitor monthly levels until stable doses are achieved, then every six months thereafter.</p><p>Possible side effects include sedation, ataxia, behavioral disinhibition, and hypersalivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 \">table 3</a>).

Although patients with DS are at increased risk for post-vaccination febrile seizures, evidence suggests that immunizations before or after disease onset do not affect clinical and intellectual outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H329654583\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine-associated seizures'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly used antiseizure drugs in patients with DS are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobazam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clobazam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">topiramate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stiripentol-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stiripentol</a> (where available), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levetiracetam</a>, and bromides. Among these, we suggest valproate and clobazam as first-line therapies in most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). As in other patients with epilepsy, antiseizure drug therapy is approached in a stepwise manner, maximizing one drug before adding a second, with close monitoring for clinical response and toxicity.
