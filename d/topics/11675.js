Most gait disorders in elderly people are multifactorial and have both neurologic and non-neurologic components. Furthermore, gait disturbances in the elderly are a risk factor for future cardiovascular disease and dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the physiologic and clinical aspects of age-related gait disorders, with an emphasis on neurologic causes.</p><p>Falling in the elderly is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF GAIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Walking is easy; we do it all the time. It may be a purely automatic movement, or we can take control and consciously direct our gait. The underlying mechanisms are complex, and only if we understand the physiology can we make sense of the pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Intimately associated with the propulsive movement that we call gait is the control of balance and posture, both at rest and with movement. The center of gravity must be kept within the vertical projections of a narrow base. In humans, two-thirds of the total body weight is centered in the upper body, which makes for inherent instability. The limits of stability have been defined as an inverted cone with the apex at the feet and the base defining a perimeter at the head. Sway outside of the perimeter results in instability. The dimensions of the base of the cone are roughly 12.5 degrees in the anteroposterior diameter and 16 degrees laterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Walking is a complex behavior that requires not only control of starting and stopping locomotion, but also ongoing adjustments of speed, stride length, cadence, direction, and posture in response to dynamic internal and external cues. Human gait can be objectively measured using direct or indirect kinematic, spatial, or temporal measures via video-analysis, footfall studies, or wearable devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The control of gait and posture is multifactorial, and a defect at any level of control can result in a gait disorder. The task of the clinician is to define the pathophysiology at a bedside level and then, if possible, to suggest a treatment mode. The task of the investigator is to define the various circuits and networks that are part of normal walking or are dysfunctional.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal centers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Walking is &quot;hard wired&quot; into the system. Animals after delivery can get to their feet and walk, if somewhat unsteadily. Newborn infants exhibit the phenomenon of automatic stepping, a rhythmic, locomotor-like behavior, which can be elicited directly after birth when the baby is held under the arms and the feet touch a surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In cats subjected to thoracic spinal transection, patterns of muscle activation that resemble actual locomotion in intact animals can be induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The lower spinal cord neurons and circuitry that produce this movement are called central pattern generators. The exact circuitry is unknown, but it involves a complex network of neurons distributed through multiple lumbar spinal segments. The central pattern generator produces a rhythmic alteration in activation of hind limb muscles, which can be analyzed in terms of a swing phase when the foot is off the ground and a stance phase when the foot is planted and the leg extended.</p><p>When the pelvis is propped up and the animal supported on a treadmill and chemically primed with catecholamines, the spinal cat adapts to belt speed and will change from the alternating walking gait to a trot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This adaptation requires sensory input from the feet to the spinal circuits coordinating locomotion. Feedback from load receptors and proprioceptive receptors facilitate the reflex. Rhythmic activation and inhibition alternates between extensors and flexors, prompting the suggestion that the central pattern generator is divided into two halves, one for extensors and one for flexors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The spinal central pattern generator is not autonomous in the intact nervous system but is under control of higher centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Higher centers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for higher center control of gait in animals has been derived from both ablation and brainstem sectioning experiments, and from stimulation experiments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the brainstem, locomotor regions contain neurons that produce locomotion when chemically or electrically activated. The mesencephalon, medial medullary reticular formation, and the pontomedullary locomotor strip are so designated, and, in turn, are influenced in a phase-dependent manner by vestibular, reticular, and rubral input. Electrical stimulation experiments demonstrate that the locus ceruleus, raphe nuclei, and cuneiform nucleus also modulate electrical activity in muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In the treadmill cat preparation, vestibulospinal neurons are rhythmically and incrementally recruited, and help control rhythm, power, and phase of locomotor movement.</p><p>Cerebellar outflow contributes to the adjustment and timing of limb movements. During walking, the discharge of most Purkinje cells, the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, is modulated in the rhythm of stepping. Rhythmic modulation of rubrospinal, reticulospinal, and vestibulospinal neurons is mostly abolished after cerebellar ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], so it is suggested that rhythmic afferent signals to the cerebellum via the spinocerebellar pathways influence cerebellar neurons, which, in turn, entrain activity of descending brainstem tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Three distinct types of systems appear to be involved in the control of locomotion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The motor system produces propulsive movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The postural system maintains appropriate body orientation and balance during ongoing locomotion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goal-directed aspects of locomotive behavior bring the organism to the designated goal of the locomotor episode</p><p/><p>The behavioral context of locomotion is exploratory (mediated by the basal ganglia), appetitive (lateral hypothalamus), and defensive (medial hypothalamus and central gray). The caudate is an input nucleus to the basal ganglia; if the caudate is ablated, cats exhibit a compulsory approach syndrome and walking is stimulus bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Finally, the whole system is under the watchful control of the cortex, which receives proprioceptive information from the lower limbs. Different populations of motor cortical cells regulate the activities of muscles that act around different joints active at different times in the swing phase of the step cycle. A gait center in the frontal lobe is proposed because patients with frontal pathology have gait disorders. The influence of the cortex on gait may be silent, or it can take control of the process on a volitional basis.</p><p>Elderly people with gait disorders may find it difficult to multitask while walking, perhaps because of poor functional reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, the &quot;Dual Task Paradigm&quot; may show cessation of talking while walking. Slow gait and decreased executive dysfunction may be due to age-dependent microvascular damage to neuronal networks (ie, &quot;brain failure&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>It becomes evident that the control of walking is a highly complex and integrated activity. With multiple control points, multiple areas of vulnerability to disruption of normal gait are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Knowledge of the basic physiology is a good starting point in gait disorder analysis.</p><p>More sophisticated analysis of gait by posturography and studies of gait variability are largely research tools, but can help with rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND IMPACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data are limited, neurologic evaluation and gait assessment of a population-based cohort of 488 older (ages 60 to 97 years) community-dwelling subjects from Italy found that the overall prevalence of impaired gait was 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among subjects age 80 and older, the prevalence was 62 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one study of patients hospitalized with neurologic disorders, 60 percent had a gait disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a nursing home population, 50 percent of people had a gait disorder, and falls were frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The impact of gait disorders ranges from serious (reduced mobility and diminished quality of life) to devastating (falls, major fractures, head trauma, and reduced survival) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. As many as 30 percent of people age 65 and older fall each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and 17 percent of falls in the elderly can be attributed to balance or gait disorders, or to leg weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The death rate for injuries in which falls are a contributing factor is more than 100 per 100,000 population after age 85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a pooled analysis of nine cohort studies with individual patient data from over 34,000 adults ages 65 years and older, gait speed was associated with survival, with a hazard ratio per 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> faster gait speed of 0.88 (95% CI 0.87-0.90) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>To define the frequency of the various causes of gait disorders, we initially surveyed 50 consecutive elderly patients with gait problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and a later report added another 70 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The breakdown of causes for these 120 patients was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory deficits, 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelopathy, 17 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple infarcts, 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown cause, 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parkinsonism, 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar degeneration, 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrocephalus, 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscellaneous, 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychogenic, 3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Toxic/metabolic,</span> 2.5 percent</p><p/><p>In the population-based study of 488 community-dwelling older subjects from Italy, neurologic, non-neurologic, and combined gait disorders were present in 24, 17, and 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among subjects classified as having neurologic gait disorders, the most common involved multiple neurologic causes, often labeled a &quot;multifactorial gait disorder,&quot; followed by peripheral sensory neuropathy and parkinsonism as the most frequent of the single neurologic causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts at classification of gait disorders often adhere to a syndromic view. Alternatively, the classification can be based upon the cause, as defined by careful neurologic examination.</p><p>By syndrome, one could label gait disorders as hemiparetic, paraparetic, sensory, steppage, petit pas, apraxic, propulsive, retropulsive, ataxic, waddling, dystonic, choreic, antalgic, vertiginous, and psychogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We prefer a diagnosis based upon the causative pathophysiology, as revealed by the physical examination, and confirmed if necessary by laboratory studies.</p><p>The first checkpoint in the evaluation and diagnosis of gait disorders is to distinguish neurologic causes from non-neurologic causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike most other neurologic syndromes, the history is relatively unhelpful in the majority of patients with gait disorders. Patients complain of &quot;weakness,&quot; &quot;dizziness,&quot; or just plain &quot;I can't walk.&quot;</p><p>It is important to inquire about bladder dysfunction in patients with a gait disorder, since the pattern of urinary symptoms may be a clue to the anatomic localization and etiology of the gait disorder. In general, when central nervous system dysfunction affects the bladder, it results in detrusor hyperactivity that leads to symptoms of urgency and urge incontinence. Patients with frontal lobe impairment may be indifferent to or unconcerned about the incontinence. Patients with thoracic cord lesions may have dyssynergia, in which the detrusor contracts on a closed sphincter resulting in poor initiation of micturition.</p><p>The diagnosis comes from a complete and detailed neurologic examination designed to answer the question: What elementary function is interfering with normal walking? The best approach is to round up the culprits that follow and eliminate them one by one (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82835 \">table 1</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness and spasticity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deafferentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapyramidal disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellar ataxia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vestibular dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontal lobe dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic myoclonus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychogenic gait disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusional states</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic gait disorder of the elderly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weakness may be upper motor neuron (UMN) in origin (implying dysfunction of the cord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> higher central motor pathways), lower motor neuron (LMN) in origin (secondary to pathology in the spinal motor neurons or peripheral nervous system), or myopathic in origin (secondary to muscle disease).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In UMN weakness, the typical distribution particularly involves hip flexion, foot and toe dorsiflexion, leg flexion at the knee (hamstrings), and thigh abduction. The other muscles in the legs may be slightly weak, but never to the same extent as the &quot;UMN&quot; muscles. A myelopathy is likely if UMN weakness is bilateral; the pathology is likely higher up if UMN weakness is unilateral.<br/><br/>Bladder dysfunction in the UMN syndrome of cord dysfunction is usually that of frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence (ie, a small capacity, spastic, and overactive bladder). Hesitancy and retention suggest bladder dyssynergia, and this is usually secondary to a thoracic cord lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In LMN weakness, neurogenic dysfunction might affect any particular muscle group if a root is involved, or a specific muscle if a nerve is involved. Predominant quadriceps weakness is always LMN in origin; the knee fails to lock and this causes falls. Toe flexion and foot plantar flexion weakness usually suggest a LMN cause. It may be difficult to separate a LMN foot drop (ie, foot extensor weakness) from an UMN lesion; wasting of extensor digitorum brevis, weakness of foot inversion, and sparing of iliopsoas argues for LMN pathology.<br/><br/>In acute bilateral cauda equina lesions, urinary retention may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In myopathic weakness, the proximal muscles are typically involved, and the Trendelenburg test is positive: when bearing weight on one lower limb, the pelvis tilts down on the contralateral side because of weakness of gluteus medius.</p><p/><p>Clinical features of gait problems vary according to the origin of weakness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UMN gait: When walking, the toes do not adequately clear the ground because the hip flexors are weak, and the toes scuff with each step. The strategy of circumduction at the hip helps with toe clearance. Inspection of the patient's shoes may show wearing of the soles at the tips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LMN gait: In a patient with LMN foot drop, the gait is high stepping because the hip flexors are strong and compensate for the weakness to allow foot clearance. There may be an audible slap as the foot hits the ground.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myopathic gait: In myopathy, because of limb girdle weakness, the gait is waddling and there is abnormal pelvic tilt with each step.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Spasticity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spasticity in the lower limbs is one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. It may be present in the absence of weakness and usually signals a myelopathy. With the patient on the examination table, the examiner first rotates the volitionally relaxed leg. If the foot moves en bloc with the leg, increased tone is present. The examiner then suddenly jerks the leg up at the popliteal fossa. The normal response is for the knee to flex and the heel to move proximally, scraping on the sheet. If the leg jerks upwards before relaxing, spasticity is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gait: The spastic gait is narrow-based; the toes turn in and scrape on the floor with each step, producing a scuffing sound and wearing of the tips of the soles.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Deafferentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proprioception is the first line of defense in responding to unexpected external perturbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Severe loss of position sense in the feet can be as disabling as severe weakness. Patients with milder deficits may be clumsy and bump into things. They are always worse in the dark when the &quot;crutch&quot; of vision is lost. The Romberg test is positive.</p><p>The site of pathology will usually be posterior column dysfunction in the spinal cord. A common cause is cervical spondylotic myelopathy, but a serum B12 level and syphilis serology should always be checked. Imaging for cord compression is mandatory. Occasionally, a very severe sensory neuronopathy can present in this way; the likely candidate in such cases is diabetes (diabetic pseudotabes), but paraneoplastic dorsal ganglionic neuropathy may present like this. A cortical lesion can occasionally interfere with proprioception. Medial medullary and thalamic infarctions are rare causes of proprioceptive loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gait: Classically, the gait associated with disturbed proprioception is described as high stepping and stamping. The stamping is thought to be an attempt to increase sensory feedback. In practice, the patients often come down hard on their heels and then slap the sole of the foot on the floor, with the same objective. The gait may be slightly wide-based. Stride length is normal or a little reduced, and the gait deteriorates markedly in the dark.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrapyramidal disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Movement disorders due to dysfunction in the basal ganglia may be hyperkinetic as in chorea or athetosis, or hypokinetic as in Parkinson disease (PD) or other disorders characterized by parkinsonism, such as multiple system atrophy. Hyperkinetic disorders do not usually interfere with gait unless very advanced. In contrast, PD is a significant cause of gait dysfunction, posture, and balance problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The cardinal signs of PD are akinesia, plastic hypertonia, and tremor. James Parkinson (1817) described the gait as follows: &quot;The propensity to lean forwards becomes invincible, and the patient is thereby forced to step on the toes and fore part of the feet, whilst the upper part of the body is thrown so far forward as to render it difficult to avoid falling on the face. In some cases, when this state of the malady is attained, the patient can no longer exercise himself by walking in his usual manner, but is thrown on the toes and fore part of the feet; being, at the same time, irresistibly impelled to take much quicker and shorter steps, and thereby to adopt unwillingly a running pace&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>PD is usually regarded as being idiopathic, but it may be secondary to genetic deficits. The pathogenesis and clinical features of PD are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to PD, parkinsonism may be caused by other neurodegenerative diseases (multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration), toxic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], or small vessel cerebrovascular disease. &quot;Lower-half parkinsonism&quot; is the term applied to the clinical situation where the legs exhibit the signs of a parkinsonian gait while the arms are unaffected (ie, no gait initiation, arms pumping rapidly); its presence is a clue to a vascular etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Neuropathologic evidence suggests that mild parkinsonian signs in old age are associated with the presence of macroscopic infarcts, microscopic infarcts, and arteriolosclerosis (ie, small vessel disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. After the influenza epidemic of 1917, postencephalitic parkinsonism was common and characterized by oculogyric crises, blepharospasm, and tics.</p><p>The gait disorder in PD responds to levodopa, at least in the early stages of the disease. Failure to respond is a clue to the diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, parkinsonism secondary to cerebrovascular disease, or a <span class=\"nowrap\">metabolic/genetic</span> disorder of the basal ganglia.

There is a stooped posture, and poor or no arm swing when walking. Flexion at the elbows becomes prominent; the hands are pronated and the fingers flexed at the metacarpophalangeal joints, a sign known as the &quot;striatal hand.&quot; When tremor is a major feature, the arm is usually extended at the elbow with a flexion extension <span class=\"nowrap\">finger/hand</span> tremor. The center of gravity is thrown forwards and the patient takes increasingly faster, short (petit pas) steps that give the appearance of hurrying or &quot;festinating.&quot; There may be difficulty initiating gait, and a few preliminary steps on the spot are taken before take-off (start hesitation). When stepping through a doorway or when initiating a sudden turn, walking may stop altogether (freezing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. When standing, the patient is easily displaced backwards and may take a few backwards steps (retropulsion). When asked to turn rapidly, turning is accomplished by making a number of small steps, rather than by pivoting on the foot as in an &quot;army about face.&quot;</p><p/><p>As the disease progresses, there is a significant risk of falling, and the rate of falling can be as high as 70 percent in one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In patients with freezing of gait, radiotracer imaging demonstrates deficits in orbitofrontal and parietal regions of the brain, mainly on the right side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Since the parietal lobe is a major sensory area, this may explain the effect of cuing as a modality to help initiate walking. Functional MRI studies suggest that freezing emerges when altered cortical control of gait is combined with a limited ability of the mesencephalic locomotor region to react to that alteration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebellar ataxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cerebellum can be regarded as an information processing center for learned and programmed movement, and for control of balance by feedback mechanisms. The cerebellum may act as a &quot;central clock&quot; that assists in the timely launching of movements with respect to previous movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The patient with cerebellar ataxia has difficulty changing voluntary force levels abruptly. Acceleration and braking are impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This leads to overshoot in point-to-point movements (dysmetria). In multijoint movements, there is a breakdown of normal coordination of joint rotations, with trajectory abnormalities (dyssynergia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The rhythm of repetitive, alternating single movements, such as finger tapping, breaks down (dysrhythmia). Dysfunction in the vermis or paleocerebellum results in truncal and gait ataxia.</p><p>The causes of cerebellar ataxia are legion and the workup for these patients is extensive. Some of the more common causes are metabolic abnormalities, such as hypothyroidism, that can be treated with variable results.</p><p>Other causes of cerebellar ataxia are resistant to treatment. Some possibilities include vitamin E deficiency (or that of its transporter protein), gliadin antibody syndrome (gluten allergy), trauma, anoxia, alcoholism, cerebrovascular disease, demyelination, mass lesions, paraneoplastic degeneration, and infections such as chicken pox in childhood. To these must be added mitochondrial abnormalities and genetically determined cerebellar degenerations or spinocerebellar ataxias, for which the list of abnormal genes continues to grow steadily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

It receives the &quot;body in space&quot; signals, and the somatosensory system measures joint angles or &quot;support in space&quot; signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In bilateral vestibular dysfunction, there is loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, leading to oscillopsia with head movement, and to unsteadiness when visual and somatosensory input is diminished, as in walking in the dark or on uneven ground.</p><p>In unilateral vestibular dysfunction, there is rotary vertigo and a feeling of body tilt. Nystagmus is prominent and there is a subjective sense of self-motion in the direction of the fast phase. There is then a compensatory reaction which results in objective postural destabilization, gait deviation, and falling to the side opposite to the fast phase of nystagmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The observation that patients are &quot;better off running than walking&quot; in the presence of vestibulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] suggests that locomotion is largely independent of the actual control of the vestibular system, especially active linear path integration. An automatic spinal program of locomotion may trigger the inhibition of descending vestibulospinal activity.</p><p>A practical problem in the dizzy patient is to distinguish central from peripheral vertigo. Other brainstem signs on examination are hard evidence for a central cause. Rotary, upbeat, and direction-changing nystagmus also support a central origin. One should also consider nonvestibulopathic dizziness as a cause of gait and postural instability. Postural hypotension is easily diagnosed at the bedside, but further study may be necessary to demonstrate a cardiac arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dizziness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dizziness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, psychogenic problems result in the subjective complaint of postural and gait instability (phobic postural vertigo). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Functional gait disorder'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gait: In vestibular dysfunction, there is deviation on walking to the side of the affected ear. The gait varies from an occasional stumble to frank veering. The legs are slightly spread, and stride length is slightly reduced. Stamping on the spot with eyes closed demonstrates the veering (Unterberger test). The presence of nystagmus firms up the diagnosis of vestibular gait disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Frontal lobe dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In higher-level gait disorders, basic motor and sensory functions are intact, and the problem may be regarded as a failure of motor programming. The cognitive screen may be abnormal and demonstrate loss of executive skills. The primary motor cortex, the premotor area, and the supplementary motor area are involved in the initiation, guidance, and internal cueing of gait.</p><p>Nutt and colleagues classified frontal gait disorders as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cautious gait, a consequence of compensatory adjustments in response to real or perceived disequilibrium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated gait ignition failure, characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining locomotion, and caused by lesions in the frontal lobe, white matter connections, or basal ganglia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontal disequilibrium, characterized by inappropriate or counterproductive postural and locomotion responses, and caused by lesions in the frontal lobe and white matter connections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontal gait disorder, characterized by variable base (narrow to wide), short shuffling steps, disequilibrium, and start and turn hesitation, and caused by lesion in the frontal lobe and white matter</p><p/><p>It should be noted that the clinical appearance of what looks like a classical frontal gait disorder is very similar to the gait of Parkinson disease, but the latter has other confirmatory signs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Loss of fibers interconnecting bilateral cortical regions is important, especially those involving the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in cognitive control of motor performance. This may be a direct effect of small vessel disease (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and neurodegenerative diseases are other causes. Occasionally, a space-taking frontal lobe tumor will present in this fashion. Magnetic resonance tensor imaging studies demonstrate abnormalities in areas of white matter that may appear normal on conventional MRI. Loss of white matter integrity in major anterior projection fibers (thalamic radiations, corticofugal motor tracts) and adjacent association fibers (corpus callosum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, short association fibers) show the greatest covariance with poorer gait. White matter lesions probably contribute to age-related gait decline by disconnecting motor networks served by these tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-gait-disorders-of-elderly-people/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence is suggestive of NPH, and a gait disorder is usually the first sign to appear in patients with NPH. On brain imaging with CT or MRI, the characteristic feature of NPH is enlargement of the ventricular system out of proportion to the degree of cortical atrophy. This is in contrast to &quot;hydrocephalus ex vacuo,&quot; in which the cerebral ventricles are enlarged more or less in proportion to the amount of cortical atrophy. The distinction may be difficult to establish, and over the years many diagnostic tests for NPH have been suggested, only to be abandoned because of insensitivity or poor specificity. NPH is discussed in detail separately.

There may be excessive slowness and stiffness, or maintenance of postural control on a narrow base with flailing arms and excessive trunk sway. Astasia-abasia, an inability to stand (astasia) or walk (abasia) in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities, was the term applied by investigators in the mid- to late 19<sup>th</sup> century to describe certain patients with a frankly functional gait. Other descriptive terms include gaits that resemble walking on ice, walking a sticky surface, walking through water (bringing to mind excessive slowness), tightrope walking, habitual limping, and bizarre, robotic, knock-kneed, trepidant, anxious, and cautious gaits.

When walking, the patient with UMN weakness does not adequately clear the ground with the toe because the hip flexors are weak. The strategy of circumduction at the hip helps clearance. Patients with LMN weakness typically have a foot drop and the gait is high stepping because the hip flexors are strong and compensate for the weakness to allow foot clearance. With myopathy, the gait is waddling and there is abnormal pelvic tilt with each step because of limb girdle weakness.

While hyperkinetic disorders do not usually interfere with gait unless very advanced, Parkinson disease is a significant cause of gait dysfunction. The parkinsonian gait is narrow based with reduced stride length, and the feet barely clear the floor. There is poor or no arm swing when walking and the posture is stooped.
