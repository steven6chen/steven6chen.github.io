Although it is often highly aggressive, the disease course of ATL is variable and in some cases it is quite indolent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other distinct T cell neoplasms include mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, T cell prolymphocytic leukemia, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma, and precursor T cell lymphoblastic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span>. These disorders are not caused by HTLV-1.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies suggest that HTLV-I is primarily transmitted by breastfeeding, although spread via blood transfusion, sharing of needles, and sexual intercourse also occurs. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-virology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human T-lymphotropic virus type I: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, pathology, and diagnosis of ATL will be discussed here; the treatment of ATL is discussed separately.

Incidence varies by population according to the prevalence of HTLV-I infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Infection with HTLV-1 is endemic in several islands in southern Japan, the Caribbean basin (eg, Jamaica and Trinidad), western Africa, Peru, northeast Iran, and the southeastern portion of the United States; most affected patients live in or originate from these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].</p><p>In the United States as a whole, the incidence of ATL is approximately 0.05 cases per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. ATL is more common in Black Americans and <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders than White Americans and there is a slight male predominance overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The median age at diagnosis is in the sixth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. However, median age at diagnosis can vary with geographic location. As an example, a study of 126 patients with ATL from Jamaica reported a median age of 43 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Since ATL is associated with HTLV-I infection, patients with ATL are also at risk for HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, also known as tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV-I-associated myelopathy is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human T-lymphotropic virus type I: Disease associations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is uniformly associated with HTLV-I infection of CD4-positive T cells, the cell of origin for the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; this infection is thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ATL. In xenograft models, the tumor-initiating cell appears to be an HTLV-I infected CD4-positive memory T cell with stem cell-like properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All of the malignant cells in a particular tumor share the same HTLV-I pro-viral genomic integration site. Since pro-viral integration appears to occur in a more or less random fashion, the clonal nature of pro-viral integration in tumors indicates that viral infection and integration must occur prior to malignant transformation and clonal expansion. It is unclear whether the particular insertion location affects the phenotype of the cell (eg, by dysregulating nearby genes). </p><p>It is estimated that there are 5 to 10 million HTLV-1 carriers worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The long-term risk of developing ATL following infection with HTLV-I in endemic areas has been estimated to be 4 to 5 percent, usually after a latency period of several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Exposure to the virus early in life increases the risk of eventual development of ATL. A shorter latency period has been noted in infected patients receiving treatment with immunosuppressive agents for other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The low incidence of ATL in HTLV-I infected individuals and the long latency period between HTLV-I infection and ATL development indicate that infection with HTLV-I alone is insufficient for malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. Additional etiologic factors have not yet been identified.</p><p>The exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to tumor development is unknown. However, the tax oncoprotein (the gene product of the viral gene <em>tax</em> [transactivating gene of the X region]) induces cellular proliferation, promotes cellular survival, and impairs DNA damage repair mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Tax protein activates gene expression by acting on host transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB); tax protein results in migration of NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it activates genes responsible for cellular proliferation. In addition, tumor survival is promoted by the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] and by the inactivation of the tumor suppressor TP53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Mutations in <em>RHOA</em>, which encodes a GTP-binding protein, and <em>TET2</em>, an epigenetic regulator, are found in a subset of ATL cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. <em>RHOA</em> and <em>TET2</em> mutations are also seen in other subtypes of peripheral T cell tumors (eg, angioimmunoblastic lymphoma), but their functional contributions to ATL and other T cell malignancies remain to be ascertained. Whole exome sequencing of 81 cases of ATL identified 50 genes that were recurrently mutated, including 13 genes that were mutated in more than 10 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The most frequently mutated genes included <em>PLCG1 </em>(36 percent), <em>PRKCB </em>(33 percent), <em>CARD11 </em>(24 percent), <em>VAV1 </em>(18 percent), and <em>IRF4 </em>(14 percent), all of which are involved in signaling downstream of the T cell receptor and lead to activation of NF-kB. This same study noted that ATL cells often acquire copy number variants, some involving regions containing the genes cited above. Other frequently affected genes include <em>TP53</em>, which is mutated in 10 to 50 percent of ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]; and <em>RB1</em>, which is usually unmutated but may be suppressed through other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Finally, ATL is one of a number of cancers in which structural aberrations have been reported to lead to overexpression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], possibly pointing to an important role for immuno-evasion in its development and progression.</p><p>As described below, ATL is frequently associated with hypercalcemia, which can be severe. The hypercalcemia seen in ATL is paraneoplastic in origin, and thought to arise from cytokines liberated from the malignant cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypercalcemia-of-malignancy-mechanisms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypercalcemia of malignancy: Mechanisms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following mechanisms have been proposed as causes of hypercalcemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitutive production of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH-RP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor necrosis factor-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] or interleukin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased expression of <em>RANKL </em>(receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]</p><p/><p>These factors may also contribute to the genesis of the lytic bone lesions, increased bone turnover, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, and the &quot;super scan&quot; of the skeleton seen on radionuclide imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) include evidence of generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, immunosuppression, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, and skin lesions.

Identification of at least 5 percent tumor cells by cytology and immunophenotype in the peripheral blood with confirmation of HTLV-1 infection is often sufficient to make the diagnosis in patients with acute, chronic, or smoldering type ATL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Patients with lymphomatous lesions should undergo an excisional biopsy of an involved lymph node for histopathologic examination. Testing for clonal pro-viral integration is not routinely performed, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by tests for HTLV-1 specific antibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for the presence of pro-virus in peripheral blood cells.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations &ndash; There are no pathognomonic clinical features that clearly distinguish ATL from other disorders. As previously described, a number of clinical variants have been defined. Common features include generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, immunosuppression, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, and skin lesions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HTLV-1 infection &ndash; Practically all patients with ATL have serologic antibodies to HTLV-I. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most frequently used screening test, using antigens prepared from whole virus lysate or by recombinant technology. Western blotting (WB) is normally used for confirmatory testing. WB also distinguishes between infection with HTLV-I and the less pathogenic HTLV-II.<br/><br/>PCR-based testing to detect proviral DNA in tumor cells should be performed in the rare instance where serology is negative but suspicion for ATL is high. This test will also differentiate HTLV-I from HTLV-II infection. Southern blotting can be used to identify the presence of clonal HTLV provirus within tumor cells, but is not available in most clinical centers. Details on the diagnosis of HTLV-I infection are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-t-lymphotropic-virus-type-i-disease-associations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human T-lymphotropic virus type I: Disease associations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histology &ndash; As described above, the tumor cell morphology is quite variable.

An alternative is to use conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for T cell receptor gene rearrangements, which can be used to determine if a clonal T cell population is emerging.

Both of these disorders can have cutaneous manifestations with malignant T cells circulating in the peripheral blood and skin biopsy findings that are practically identical morphologically. They can also have a similar immunophenotype, as both may be CD4+, CD7-, and CD25+, though CD25 positivity usually is more variable in CTCL and confined to a minor subset of cells. The key distinguishing feature is the presence of HTLV-I in the malignant cells of ATL.

Immunophenotype can help distinguish this disorder from ATL. As with ATL, T-PLL is CD4+. However, unlike ATL, T-PLL is CD7+ and CD25-. HTLV-I is not incorporated into the genome of the malignant cell, and more than 80 percent of tumors have genetic abnormalities, usually an inversion of chromosome 14 that fuses the TCL1 gene to the T cell receptor (TCR) <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/delta</span> locus and leads to the overexpression of TCL1 protein.

The morphology of the malignant cells is varied but one common feature is the prominent arborizing high endothelial venules not typically found in ATL. Immunophenotyping typically demonstrates CD4 positivity and decreased intensity of CD7; however, the cell of origin of AITL is a follicular T cell, and the tumor cell of AITL bears certain immunophenotypic features of follicular T cells, such as expression of PD-1, CXCL13, CD10, and BCL6, that are absent for ATL.

Incidence varies by population according to the prevalence of HTLV-I infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term risk of developing ATL following infection with HTLV-I in endemic areas has been estimated to be 4 to 5 percent, usually after a latency period of several decades. The exact mechanism by which HTLV-I contributes to tumor development is unknown. However, the viral tax oncoprotein (encoded by the viral <em>tax</em> gene) is associated with increased cellular proliferation and survival, and impaired DNA damage repair mechanisms (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of ATL include evidence of generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, immunosuppression, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, and skin lesions. The frequency of these differs among patient groups and has been the basis upon which clinical variants have been defined. There are four basic clinical variants of ATL: acute (60 percent of cases), lymphomatous (20 percent of cases), chronic (10 percent of cases) and smoldering (10 percent of cases). In addition, ATL can progress from a chronic or smoldering variant to an aggressive disease resembling the acute variant. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most characteristic morphologic changes seen in the peripheral blood of ATL patients are cells with bizarre hyperlobulated nuclei (&quot;clover leaf&quot; or &quot;flower cells&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82314 \">picture 1</a>). Bone marrow infiltrates are usually patchy. Involved lymph nodes typically display diffuse architectural effacement. Skin infiltrates can be similar to those seen in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Morphology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cell of origin in ATL is an HTLV-I infected (CD4+) T cell that may reside in a long-lived pool of memory T cells with stem-like cells properties. In the majority of cases, the tumor cells also express other T cell associated antigens (CD2 and CD5), lack CD7, and express the IL-2 receptor, CD25. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no distinct molecular or karyotypic abnormality in ATL. The T cell receptor genes are clonally rearranged, and all cases demonstrate clonally integrated HTLV-I. The more clinically aggressive ATL variants have the most complex chromosomal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ATL is based upon a combination of specific clinical features, the morphology and immunophenotype of the malignant cells, and the presence of HTLV-I infection.
