The most important factors contributing to cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are progressive tumor growth, treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic response modifiers, molecularly targeted therapy (particularly the small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) or radiation therapy (RT), anemia, pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, and poor nutrition. CRF is particularly prevalent with multimodality or dose-intense treatment protocols, and in patients with metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CRF profoundly affects quality of life (QOL) of both patients and their families, including physical, psychosocial, and <span class=\"nowrap\">economic/occupational</span> aspects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Fatigue is routinely identified by patients as one of the most distressing symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment, yet historically it has been consistently underreported and overlooked as a potentially remediable cause of treatment-related morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contemporary oncologic treatment, however, screening for and treatment of CRF has become a major focus of supportive care. Guidelines from expert groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2813\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>, recommend screening for CRF at the initial visit, after completion of primary therapy, as clinically indicated (and at least annually) during the period of cancer survivorship, at the time that advanced disease is diagnosed, and at all chemotherapy visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Patients who have completed primary treatment and are undergoing posttreatment surveillance should continue to be monitored because fatigue may persist beyond the time of active treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment#H433791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers#H418032179\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for late or long-term effects of cancer and its treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Here we will review the management of CRF in patients receiving active cancer treatment and in cancer survivors who have completed treatment. The prevalence of fatigue in patients with cancer, screening and assessment for fatigue in this population, and an overview of fatigue in palliative care patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-overview-of-fatigue-weakness-and-asthenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Overview of fatigue, weakness, and asthenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953061916\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some basic principles apply to patients with fatigue during active cancer therapy and cancer survivors who have persistent fatigue after the completion of therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients undergoing active cancer treatment, as well as cancer survivors and their families, should be offered specific information about fatigue during and following treatment (eg, information about the difference between normal and cancer-related fatigue [CRF], persistence of fatigue beyond treatment, and causes and contributory factors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with CRF, further diagnostic evaluation may be warranted for those with moderate to severe fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potentially treatable causes of fatigue should be sought for and treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F98133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98133 \">table 1</a>). These include comorbidities (eg, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">alcohol/substance</span> abuse, endocrine dysfunction [eg, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency], cardiac, pulmonary, or renal dysfunction), medications, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, pain, nutritional issues (changes in <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/caloric</span> intake), and <span class=\"nowrap\">deconditioning/loss</span> of muscle mass. The clinical team must decide whether referral to an appropriately trained professional (eg, cardiologist, endocrinologist, mental health professional, internist) is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H254671514\" class=\"local\">'Control of contributory factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that may contribute to fatigue should be managed appropriately (eg, pain, dyspnea, nausea, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and anorexia). (See <a href=\"#H606308092\" class=\"local\">'Control of physical symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with cancer-related pain who are receiving opioids, opioid analgesics should be titrated or the <span class=\"nowrap\">schedule/agent</span> modified so as to alleviate pain without causing significant fatigue. If needed, a trial of psychostimulants may help to reverse opioid-related sedation. (See <a href=\"#H594452048\" class=\"local\">'Patients receiving opioids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for CRF are discussed in the sections below. Specific recommendations for managing CRF in patients receiving active treatment, cancer survivors, and in terminal patients receiving palliative care are summarized below. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594451919\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of CRF involves specific treatment for potentially reversible causes (ie, treating anemia or metabolic or endocrine abnormalities, as well as managing pain, insomnia, depression, or anxiety) and symptomatic measures when no obvious etiology or reversible cause can be identified. Nonspecific symptom-based treatment measures include education, counseling, and pharmacologic (eg, psychostimulants and other wakefulness agents) as well as nonpharmacologic (eg, exercise, yoga, acupuncture) measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H254671514\"><span class=\"h2\">Control of contributory factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If any of the factors known to be associated with fatigue is identified (eg, anemia, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, sleep disorder, opioid-related sedation), these should be addressed as the initial approach to fatigue. Optimizing management of physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, and dyspnea can help to alleviate fatigue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Main contributory factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606308092\"><span class=\"h3\">Control of physical symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical symptoms such as nausea, dyspnea, and pain may be associated with fatigue, particularly in patients with advanced cancer. Optimizing management of these physical symptoms may significantly alleviate fatigue. The benefits of systematic monitoring and treatment of physical symptoms in fatigued patients was shown in a randomized trial in which 152 fatigued patients (fatigue score &ge;4 on a numerical rating scale of 0 to 10) with advanced cancer were randomly assigned to protocolized, patient-tailored treatment or usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The intervention group consisted of four meetings over a 10-week period with a nurse specialist who coordinated a complex intervention aimed at identifying and treating symptoms of pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, cough, and dry mouth. There were modest but significant improvements over time in favor of the nurse-led intervention for the primary outcome (general fatigue, as assessed by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory [MFI]) as well as for secondary outcomes such as level of reduced activity, symptom burden, interference of fatigue with daily life, anxiety, and intensity of fatigue as measured by the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Anemic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia is the most common reversible cause of CRF, particularly among patients receiving chemotherapy. Correction of anemia has been associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life (QOL) and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Optimal management of symptomatic anemia requires an accurate diagnosis to identify potentially remediable causes (eg, ongoing blood loss, hemolysis, iron, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency). If a potentially treatable cause cannot be identified, treatment options include red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, or for patients with chemotherapy-related myelosuppression, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-complications-of-malignancy-anemia-and-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic complications of malignancy: Anemia and bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10231168\"><span class=\"h4\">Transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusions of packed red blood cells can improve fatigue due to anemia, although higher-quality studies are needed to determine which patients are most likely to respond, which are not, and the duration of any response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, for those patients requiring repeated transfusions, there are potential harms, including blood-borne infection, acute transfusion reaction, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, subtle immune modulation, and iron overload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78476\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78476 \">table 2</a>). Various topics related to RBC transfusion, including indications and transfusion thresholds, and complications are discussed in detail in other topics.

However, treatment with RBC transfusions is an appropriate alternative for patients whose clinical condition indicates the need for immediate correction of the hemoglobin level and for those in whom reducing the frequency of transfusion is not an important consideration.</p><p>ESAs have been extensively evaluated in cancer patients. While numerous randomized trials demonstrate that ESAs decrease the frequency of RBC transfusion in patients receiving chemotherapy, their impact on fatigue has been more difficult to demonstrate. A meta-analysis assessed fatigue and anemia-related symptoms, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy fatigue (FACT-F) subscale and the FACT-anemia (FACT-An) subscale in 37 placebo-controlled randomized trials of ESAs in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The FACT-F subscale contains 13 fatigue-related items while the FACT-An subscale includes the 13 fatigue-related items plus seven anemia-related questions (eg, dizziness, headache, chest pain, trouble walking). ESAs had a positive effect on anemia-related symptoms; the mean difference in FACT-An for all cancer patients was 4.09, while for those receiving chemotherapy, it was 4.5; both values were above the threshold (&ge;4) for a clinically important difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the mean difference in the FACT-F measurement for all cancer patients treated with ESAs versus placebo (2.41, 95% CI 1.39-3.43) and for those undergoing chemotherapy (2.81, 95% CI 1.73-3.90) was below the threshold (&ge;3) for a clinically important difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-in-the-treatment-of-anemia-in-patients-with-cancer#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'ESAs: efficacy, side effects, and clinical use'</a>.)</p><p>However, use of ESAs has become controversial, particularly in patients with anemia unrelated to chemotherapy and in those receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with the intent of cure, because of concerns about thromboembolic side effects, higher mortality rates, and the possibility of adverse cancer outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-in-the-treatment-of-anemia-in-patients-with-cancer#H264001313\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Thromboembolic risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-in-the-treatment-of-anemia-in-patients-with-cancer#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Effect on disease control and survival'</a>.)</p><p>These adverse outcomes have not been confirmed when ESAs are dosed appropriately to a target hemoglobin &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> the level supported by American Society of Clinical Oncology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ASCO)/American</span> Society of Hematology (ASH) and <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2813\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The use of ESAs in patients with hematologic neoplasms is more complex. Although thromboembolic events and adverse cancer outcomes have not been reported, there is less evidence to support benefit from ESAs, and responsiveness of the bone marrow may be compromised in these settings.

Stress reduction and especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may help. Patients who do not respond to these measures may require medications to help them sleep.</p><p>Sleep disturbance is common in patients with cancer, but sleep problems are seldom identified or addressed in practice. Sleep disturbance associated with fatigue is often difficult to treat and manage. It may be influenced by numerous factors including daytime naps, depression, anxiety, medication, sleep interruption because of nocturia or hot flashes, and evening food <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beverage intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50224 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Furthermore, few studies have evaluated sleep interventions to manage fatigue, and the results are conflicting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a pilot study of 25 women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, stimulus control (ie, having a consistent time to lie down and get up, avoiding caffeine and stimulating activity in the evening) and sleep restriction (ie, avoiding long or late-afternoon naps, limiting time in bed to the normal hours of sleep only) significantly improved fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Compared with the control group, both intervention groups had significantly better sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime functioning. Effect on QOL was not reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, benefit from a sleep intervention could not be shown in a trial in which 219 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I to III breast cancer were randomly assigned to an individualized sleep therapy plan (stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation therapy, and sleep hygiene, which was reinforced and revised at regular intervals) or a control group (who received only information about nutrition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although the behavioral therapy intervention significantly improved global sleep quality at early time points, this did not translate into a significant impact on either objective sleep or fatigue outcomes.</p><p/><p>Stress reduction and especially CBT may help in patients with insomnia and sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Other suggestions for improving sleep patterns include taking a warm bath or drinking a glass of warm milk prior to bedtime, avoiding caffeinated beverages following dinner, emptying the bladder just before going to bed, and scheduling naps earlier in the day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50224 \">table 3</a>). However, frequent napping during the day can interfere with a restful, &quot;restorative&quot; night's rest.</p><p>Some patients who do not respond to these measures require medications to help them sleep. Commonly used agents include benzodiazepines, antihistamines, and other nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65653 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83292\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83292 \">table 5</a>).

Patients should be offered advice on general strategies that can help to manage fatigue and guidance on self-monitoring of fatigue levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Specific suggestions to conserve energy during activities of daily living are outlined in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73183 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53415 \">table 7</a>); however, these are not recommended for cancer survivors, in whom regular physical activity is encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple small randomized trials and a meta-analysis of 77 trials indicate that a variety of nonpharmacologic psychoeducation interventions are effective for improving CRF in patients receiving active cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/22-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-29</a>], and its benefits have been shown to persist for at least two years after intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, not all data have been consistent. A meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials (Cochrane review) enrolling patients undergoing cancer treatment with palliative intent for incurable cancer suggested no benefit from nonpharmacologic strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Variations in methodologies of included studies, as well as patients enrolled, may account for differences in results of this meta-analysis and previous studies. For example, the Cochrane meta-analysis included only patients receiving treatment for incurable cancer. It is conceivable that such patients would not benefit from these interventions, whereas patients being treated with curative intent and long-term survivors may be more likely to derive some benefit.</p><p>Furthermore, whether all patients require formal CBT by a psychologist or psychiatrist in order to benefit from psychosocial interventions is unclear, and to the extent that fatigue has a physiologic basis, cognitive-behavioral interventions may not be effective in all patients. In a randomized study that included 115 patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for advanced cancer, a structured multidisciplinary program that included cognitive, emotional, physical, social, and spiritual interventions did not prevent the development of fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], even though it was associated with an improvement in QOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses demonstrate that <span class=\"nowrap\">cognitive/behavioral</span> interventions can also reduce fatigue in posttreatment survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/30,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34-37</a>], and the benefits seem to be maintained with long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Type of intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An example of a simple program of cognitive-behavioral intervention with specific adaptive strategies for management of symptoms such as fatigue is available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54322 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The intervention group also experienced a significantly greater decrease in HADS score and significantly greater increase in global QOL, but the differences were also small and of unclear clinical meaningfulness.</p><p>Further study of educational interventions in a variety of cancer patients (those under current treatment with differing interventions, those without evidence of malignancy and on no treatment, etc) and in different geographical and cultural environments is necessary to determine the impact of any educational intervention on CRF in these different settings.</p><p>Although a variety of cognitive-behavioral and psychosocial interventions can be beneficial, discovering which patients benefit from what type of psychosocial intervention is an unresolved issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. There are no randomized trials comparing different approaches, and as noted above, it is not clear that all patients require referral to a psychologist for formal CBT. The challenge to the practitioner is to match the characteristics of individual patients with the most helpful and cost-effective interventions. If possible, patients should be referred to psychosocial service providers specializing in cancer and trained to deliver empirically-based interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless contraindicated (eg, by the presence of extensive lytic bone metastases, extreme thrombocytopenia, fever or active infection, or safety issues),<strong> </strong>we recommend an individualized program of moderate aerobic exercise for most patients with CRF, both during active treatment and for those who have completed treatment. Guidelines from ASCO for management of adult cancer survivors with fatigue recommend 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (eg, fast walking, cycling, or swimming) per week, with an additional two to three strength training (eg, weight lifting) sessions weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Walking programs are generally safe for most cancer survivors; patients can begin this type of program after consulting with their doctors, without any formal exercise testing (eg, a stress test) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Patients at higher risk of injury (ie, those with neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or other long-term effects of cancer therapy) should be referred to a physical therapist or exercise specialist. Breast cancer survivors with lymphedema should also consider meeting with an exercise specialist before initiating upper-body strength training exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, because inactivity can induce muscular wasting, prolonged rest can lead to further loss of physical strength and endurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Although many fatigued patients have difficulty believing that exercise will improve their symptoms, physical exercise training programs can increase functional capacity, leading to reduced effort in performing usual activities and a decreased sense of fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-64</a>].</p><p>Research on the effects of exercise on CRF includes studies of patients receiving active treatment and those who have completed treatment.

The type of exercise is variable, with some studies evaluating walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/3,63,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,63,66,67</a>], bicycling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>], resistance training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>], deep water aquatic exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], or a combined approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-79</a>], and still others where the patient was allowed to choose the type of exercise he or she preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/61,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,80</a>]. The recommended exercise programs vary in length from six weeks to six months.</p><p>Regardless of these limitations, all trials have demonstrated significant benefits (less fatigue and emotional distress, decreased sleep disturbance, improved functional capacity, and better QOL) for moderate exercise in patients with cancer. A Cochrane review of fatigue data from 56 randomized trials of patients with CRF concluded that exercise was significantly more effective than the control intervention regardless of whether it was delivered during or after adjuvant therapy, and that fatigue was significantly reduced by aerobic exercise but not resistance training or other alternative forms of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Improved levels of aerobic physical activity may be facilitated by the use of printed materials, a step pedometer, or a combination of these approaches, rather than a simple recommendation to perform increased activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Specific exercise programs should be preceded by a careful evaluation of comorbidities and exercise contraindications (such as extensive lytic bone metastases, extreme thrombocytopenia). The prescribed exercise program should be individualized and take into consideration the patient's age, gender, type of cancer and treatment, and the patient's physical fitness level. The initial intensity and duration of exercise should be low and slowly increased, as the patient's medical condition allows. Pool activities are an especially good form of physiotherapy.</p><p>However, neutropenic patients must avoid environments where the risk of exposure to infectious agents is high (eg, public swimming pools).</p><p>Barriers to exercise include physical and disease-related limitations, lack of <span class=\"nowrap\">time/interest/motivation/facilities,</span> and lack of encouragement from family and friends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In the largest of these trials, 302 patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer who had completed chemotherapy between one month and five years previously, and who were experiencing at least moderate fatigue (score &ge;5 on a scale of 0 to 10) were randomly assigned to usual care with and without acupuncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cancer-related-fatigue-treatment/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The usual care group received a booklet with information about fatigue and its management, while the acupuncture group received both the booklet and a once weekly treatment by an acupuncturist (needling three pairs of acupoints) for six weeks. The primary outcome was general fatigue at six weeks, as measured by the MFI. Acupuncture was of significant benefit, with an estimated difference in the week 6 general fatigue score (acupuncture minus control) of -3.11 (95% CI -3.97 to -2.25), given equal baseline scores.

Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: methylphenidate (5 mg orally every two hours up to 20 mg daily up to 14 days) plus a nursing telephone intervention (four to six phone calls by a nurse trained in palliative care over a 14-day period focusing on symptom assessment, medication review, psychosocial support, and education), placebo plus the intervention, methylphenidate with a control telephone intervention (nontherapeutic calls conducted by a nonprofessional providing neither support nor education), or placebo plus a control telephone intervention. At the end of 14 days, median scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale improved from baseline in all groups, and there were no significant differences among the groups, leading the authors to conclude that methylphenidate and nursing telephone intervention, either alone or combined, were not superior to placebo in improving CRF.

An antidepressant, analgesic, stimulant, or anxiolytic medication was recommended to 27, 25, 22, and 17 percent, respectively. With specific treatment aimed at the cause of the fatigue, 59 percent achieved targeted fatigue reductions, including 47 of 69 patients whose severe fatigue decreased to nonsevere fatigue at the first follow-up visit (67 percent success rate) and 49 percent (28 of 57) of moderately-fatigued patients who had a reduction to mild fatigue. Of the 74 successfully treated patients, 62 percent (n = 46) reported success by the first follow-up visit and 22 percent (n = 16) by the second visit. Overall, the Cancer-Related Fatigue Clinic improved fatigue for a majority of returning patients within two follow-up visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The most important factors contributing to CRF are treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic response modifiers, molecularly targeted therapy (particularly the small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the therapeutic monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>) or radiation therapy (RT), anemia, pain (and its treatment), emotional distress, sleep disturbance, poor nutrition, and other comorbidities. Although most common during active cancer therapy, CRF may affect patients long after cancer treatment has been completed.

Screening should be performed and documented using a quantitative or semiquantitative scale. A simple visual analog scale rating fatigue (VAS, &quot;How would you rate your fatigue on a scale of 0 to 10?&quot; with 0 representing no fatigue and 10 the worst imaginable fatigue) can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with mild fatigue (VAS score 1 to 3 on a scale of 1 to 10) that does not interfere with activities of daily living (ADLs) can be reassured and counseled as to coping strategies that conserve energy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73183\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73183 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53415 \">table 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fatigue that is moderate to severe (4 or higher on the VAS) or interferes with ADLs requires a comprehensive fatigue evaluation with a complete history, review of systems, physical examination, diagnostic studies, and objective assessment of associated symptoms.

The underlying causes of anemia should be identified and treated if possible. If a potentially reversible cause of the anemia cannot be identified, treatment options include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. A table illustrating the risks and benefits of ESAs versus transfusion is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78476\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78476 \">table 2</a>).

Treatment with RBC transfusions is an appropriate alternative for patients whose clinical condition indicates the need for immediate correction of the hemoglobin level and for those in whom reducing the frequency of transfusion is not an important consideration.
