This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FMF. The epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, and management of FMF and an overview of periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial Mediterranean fever: Epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterized by sporadic, and in most cases, recurrent attacks of fever and serosal inflammation as manifested by abdominal and chest pain. Most patients with FMF experience their first attack in early childhood. The initial attack occurs before the ages of 10 and 20 years in 65 and 90 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in rare cases the initial attack can occur in individuals older than 50 years of age.</p><p>The onset of fever and pain (due to serositis at one or more sites) is usually abrupt, peaking soon after onset. Some patients have a stereotypic prodrome before their attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Episodes last for one to three days and then resolve spontaneously. Patients are asymptomatic between attacks. The frequency of attacks is highly variable, even in a given patient. The intervals between episodes are irregular, ranging from one week to several months or years. Usually, FMF patients cannot describe a consistent triggering event. Nevertheless, vigorous exercise, exposure to cold, emotional stress, fatigue, surgery, and menstruation have been associated with an attack in some patients. During pregnancy, the course of FMF may worsen in about a third of the patients, improve in another third of patients, and remain unchanged in the rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3080624837\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is one of the most constant characteristics of FMF and is present in almost all cases during attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the majority of FMF patients, the temperature rises from 38&deg; to 40&deg;C, although mild attacks may be accompanied by a subfebrile temperature (37.5&deg; to 38&deg;C). Typically, the duration of the fever is brief, lasting between 12 hours and three days. Fever may be the first and only symptom of FMF, especially in toddlers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In FMF patients who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, an acute attack may occur without fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In populations where FMF is common, 95 percent of the patients with FMF have episodic abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Abdominal pain and tenderness may initially be localized and then progress to become more generalized. Since the cause of the abdominal pain is inflammation of the peritoneum, signs of peritonitis such as guarding, rebound tenderness, rigidity, and an adynamic ileus are often present. These findings can be mistaken for an acute surgical abdomen leading to diagnosis delay and sometimes even to futile operations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain#H1313593171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;, section on 'Urgent/emergent evaluation and/or surgical abdomen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painful FMF attacks are localized to the chest in 33 to 88 percent of patients, depending on the patient&rsquo;s ethnic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Chest pain may be due to inflammation of the pleura or referred pain from subdiaphragmatic inflammation. Pleural inflammation typically manifests as unilateral chest pain that is worse with inspiration or coughing. Patients often have a small, transient pleural effusion. Episodes usually resolve within three days, but may last up to one week. Concomitant pericarditis can also be observed in patients with pleuritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among non-Ashkenazi Jews with FMF, approximately 75 percent experience sudden attacks of articular pain, which may be precipitated by minor trauma or effort such as prolonged walking. The joint attacks are usually monoarticular, involving one of the large joints (knee, ankle, hip). In rare cases, patients present with a migratory polyarthritis. Gradual resolution of the signs and symptoms occur after peaking in 24 to 48 hours. The synovial fluid analysis is typically sterile, with a nucleated white cell count ranging from 200 to &gt;100,000 white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The synovitis usually resolves completely without leading to joint destruction. However, severely protracted cases can result in permanent deformity, functional limitation, osteoporosis around the affected joint, and aseptic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The arthritis may occasionally last for weeks to months, or evolve into a more chronic form of arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Erysipelas-like skin lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An erysipelas-like skin lesion is reported in 12 to 40 percent of FMF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The lesion is typically 10 to 35 cm<sup>2</sup> in area, tender, raised, and erythematous and occurs on the lower leg, ankle, or foot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F111977\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111977 \">picture 1</a>). Lesions may be transiently warm without associated pain or tenderness. Erysipelas-like skin lesions may be the presenting feature of FMF in children and may be misdiagnosed as an infectious erysipelas or cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Children with myalgia and erysipelas-like skin lesions during attacks are at increased risk for subclinical inflammation during attack-free intervals, as evidenced by elevation of acute phase reactants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recovery is spontaneous and does not require antibiotics.

It usually affects the lower limbs (thighs and calves) in children with the disease. It does not have an episodic characteristic and is not controlled by treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>. It resolves with rest or treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever#H2698807684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;, section on 'Exertional myalgia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute pericarditis</strong> &ndash; Symptomatic acute pericarditis occurs in less than one percent of patients with FMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one study, the frequency of pericarditis was found to be 11-fold higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, even in FMF, acute pericarditis is still a rare event. Clinical features of pericarditis include chest pain (sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward), pericardial friction rub, and widespread ST segment elevation on electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute scrotum</strong> &ndash; In children with FMF, acute scrotum is characterized by mostly unilateral gradual swelling of the scrotum. Operative findings show normal testes and epididymis and a thick and hyperemic tunica vaginalis. Acute scrotum should be differentiated from testicular torsion and does not require surgical intervention. Acute scrotal swelling and tenderness due to orchitis is a rare manifestation of FMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>].

Febrile myalgias usually involve the lower extremities but, in some cases, may be more diffuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with febrile myalgia have an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate but a normal serum creatine kinase level and a normal electromyogram (EMG). Protracted febrile myalgia is associated with severe course of FMF and homozygosity for M694V mutation. Although the etiology is not clear, febrile myalgia is considered to be a vasculitic manifestation of FMF. However, in none of muscle biopsies taken from these patients could frank vasculitis be shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever#H79502648\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;, section on 'Management of specific features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Headache and aseptic meningitis</strong> &ndash; Headache may accompany acute FMF attacks and are usually mild. A more severe type of headache in the form of recurrent aseptic meningitis has also been reported, but it is still unclear whether this clinical feature is part of FMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, the possibility that diseases such as IgAV (HSP) or polyarteritis nodosa, which occur in FMF patients, are actually rare manifestations of FMF has also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In most of these cases the patients are homozygous for M694V mutation in the <em>MEFV</em> gene.

Common laboratory findings include leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils as well as elevated acute phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid protein, and fibrinogen. Serum homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) concentrations are often increased in individuals with FMF during attack-free periods. The presence of otherwise unexplained proteinuria in between attacks is suggestive of renal amyloidosis. However, FMF patients with proteinuria who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> should be evaluated for causes other than amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary (AA) amyloidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive secondary (AA) amyloidosis is a major cause of mortality in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Rarely, patients can present with renal amyloidosis as the first and only manifestation of FMF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with renal amyloidosis can present with asymptomatic proteinuria or clinically apparent nephrotic syndrome and gradually develop progressive nephropathy with end-stage renal disease. End-stage renal disease develops 2 to 13 years after the onset of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Amyloid deposition can also occur in the spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract and subsequently in the heart, thyroid, and testes. Patients with gastrointestinal tract amyloidosis usually present with diarrhea and malabsorption. The clinical manifestations of amyloidosis are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-amyloidosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal amyloidosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is poor correlation between the severity or frequency of attacks of FMF and the extent of amyloidosis in individual patients. It is unclear whether the deposition of amyloid is due solely to the by-products of recurrent systemic inflammation or whether there is a contribution from the underlying genetic defect. The incidence of AA amyloidosis has markedly decreased with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. AA amyloidosis is common in untreated individuals and has a higher incidence in Sephardic Jews as compared with Ashkenazi Jews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Other significant risk factors have been identified, including the country of origin (with higher risk for patients from the eastern Mediterranean) and a positive family history of AA amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Analysis of the phenotypic expressions of the two most frequent mutations of the <em>MEFV</em> gene, V726A and M694V, suggested that amyloidosis and severe arthritis are much more frequently observed with the latter defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Other modifier proteins have also been implicated. Patients without amyloidosis are more likely to have beta and gamma alleles of type 1 serum amyloid A protein, suggesting that these alleles may be protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Carrying the alpha allele is associated with a three- to fourfold higher risk for developing amyloidosis.

FMF has been described primarily in North African Jews, Armenians, Turks, North Africans, Arabs, Greeks, and Italians. However, the disease is not restricted to these groups. In the United States, for example, FMF is frequently encountered in Ashkenazi Jews. Because cases of FMF have been diagnosed in a wide variety of other populations, ancestry should not be used to rule out the diagnosis if other clinical characteristics are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

FMF is usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The detection of two pathogenic mutations in the <em>MEFV </em>gene in an individual confirms the diagnosis. However, approximately 33 percent of patients who meet clinical criteria for FMF have only one identifiable mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,36</a>].

However, each of the periodic fever syndromes is also accompanied by a constellation of clinical features that differ from those of FMF. The other periodic fever syndromes include periodic fevers with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA); tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 associated period syndrome (TRAPS); hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS); and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). PFAPA, as the name suggests, differs from FMF in that patients present with aphthous ulcerations, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. The febrile attacks in patients with TRAPS are typically accompanied by conjunctivitis and periorbital edema in addition to focal migratory myalgias, rash, abdominal pain, and occasionally monoarthritis. The attacks of TRAPS usually last from 7 to 21 days. Patients with HIDS generally have pharyngitis, painful cervical lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, and vomiting or diarrhea in the setting of elevated levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) D. Moreover, the attack duration in HIDS is usually between three to seven days. CAPS represent a family of syndromes in which urticarial rashes and sometimes neurological involvement accompany episodic fevers. The attack duration in CAPS is usually shorter, lasting one to two days.

Patients with these conditions present with features including high-spiking fevers, rash, serositis, and lymphadenopathy. Arthritis is often evident at onset but may sometimes present weeks or months later. Unlike FMF, patients with these conditions usually have a specific daily fever pattern that does not resolve after several days.

However, these vasculitides can be distinguished from FMF by the presence of multiorgan system involvement with findings such as cutaneous small vessel vasculitis and glomerulonephritis.

Unlike FMF, patients with SLE have antinuclear antibodies (ANA) along with possible hypocomplementemia, glomerulonephritis, and cytopenias. RA can generally be distinguished from FMF by the pattern of a symmetric polyarthritis of the small joints of the hands and feet, and sometimes by the presence of a positive rheumatoid factor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody.

Organisms that can cause subacute or chronic infections are the ones most likely to imitate FMF. Relapsing fever, caused by spirochetes of the <em>Borrelia</em> genus, is an arthropod-borne infection that causes recurrent episodes of fever (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-relapsing-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of relapsing fever&quot;</a>). Human parvovirus B19 can also cause flu-like symptoms and arthralgias or arthritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a>).

However, monoclonal expansion of B and T cells (as assessed by immunophenotyping), monocytosis, or macrocytosis can distinguish these malignancies from FMF. Patients with lymphoma also typically have additional findings such as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or increased lactate dehydrogenase levels.

Genetic disorders that are associated with recurrent bouts of abdominal pain include acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary angioedema, and genetically conferred hypertriglyceridemia. Unlike FMF, these conditions do not usually present with episodic fevers and arthritis. The approach to the patient with abdominal pain is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent bouts of fever and serosal inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent attacks are characterized by abrupt onset of fever and severe pain due to serositis at one or more sites. Serositis may result in abdominal, chest, or joint pain. Episodes last for one to three days and then resolve spontaneously. In between attacks, patients are asymptomatic. Most patients with FMF experience their first attack in early childhood. The initial attack occurs before the ages of 10 and 20 years in 65 and 90 percent of cases, respectively. Other manifestations include an erysipelas-like skin lesion. Rare manifestations include acute pericarditis, acute scrotum, and febrile myalgia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute attacks of FMF are accompanied by elevation in many of the serum markers of systemic inflammation. Common laboratory findings include leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, as well as elevated acute phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid protein, and fibrinogen. In FMF patients not treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, the presence of proteinuria is suggestive of renal amyloidosis. However, in those treated with colchicine, a thorough investigation is warranted in order to evaluate for causes other than amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of FMF include secondary (AA) amyloidosis, small bowel obstruction, and infertility. The most frequent site of amyloid deposition is the kidney, although amyloid deposition can also occur in the spleen, liver, and gastrointestinal tract and subsequently in the heart, thyroid, and testes. Renal amyloidosis can be the first and only manifestation of FMF. Patients with renal amyloidosis can present with asymptomatic proteinuria or clinically apparent nephrotic syndrome and gradually develop progressive nephropathy with end-stage renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Long-term complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of FMF should be suspected in individuals with recurrent febrile episodes accompanied by peritonitis, synovitis or pleuritis, recurrent erysipelas-like erythema, repeated laparotomies for an acute abdomen with no identifiable underlying pathology, a first-degree relative with FMF, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> membership in an at-risk ethnic group. The diagnosis of FMF is made based on clinical symptoms and supported by ethnic origin and family history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67666 \">table 1</a>). Genetic testing is used to support, but not exclude, the diagnosis of FMF. In individuals who meet clinical criteria for FMF but in whom genetic testing is not diagnostic (only one or no pathogenic <em>MEFV</em> mutation), the diagnosis of FMF is supported by a six-month trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> therapy, which results in a relief of attacks and recurrence after cessation of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of FMF varies with the patient's predominant clinical features and includes other periodic fever syndromes, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult Still's disease, systemic vasculitides involving the abdomen (eg, polyarteritis nodosa, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, a variety of infections, and malignancy.
