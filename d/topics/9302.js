This technology offers a minimally invasive and potentially cost effective alternative for management of several common obstetrical and gynecological problems. It is most commonly used for managing fibroids and postpartum hemorrhage. However, these procedures have not been evaluated against other treatment modalities in large randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSCATHETER EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous transcatheter embolization (PTE) procedures are typically performed under fluoroscopic guidance in the radiology suite. Intravenous conscious sedation and narcotics, local anesthetics, nonopioid analgesics, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents are administered for management of anxiety and pain. Many radiologists give intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infection, although randomized controlled clinical trials have never validated the use of antibiotics in this setting for reduction of postoperative morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Antibiotic prophylaxis for gynecologic procedures is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 1</a>) and discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H67153299\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical site infection prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The Seldinger technique is used to introduce a catheter into the femoral artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62884 \">figure 1A</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The catheter is then advanced into the hypogastric or uterine artery, depending upon the indication for the procedure. After subselective catheterization, diagnostic angiography of the artery is obtained to confirm proper position, look for extravasation suggestive of acute bleeding, and evaluate for abnormal vascularity associated with chronic bleeding. Transcatheter embolization of one or more arteries can then be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62884%7EOBGYN%2F74642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62884 graphicRef74642 \">figure 1A-B</a>).</p><p>Tiny particles or microspheres (polyvinyl alcohol particles, 500 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 700 to 900 microns in size or tris-acryl gelatin microspheres, 500 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 700 to 900 microns in size) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57559\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57559 \">picture 1</a>) are used to embolize hypervascular lesions, such as leiomyomas or adenomyosis, associated with multiple large feeding vessels. However, particulate embolic agents should be avoided when iliac or uterine or ovarian arteriovenous <span class=\"nowrap\">malformation/fistula</span> are targeted because inadvertent pulmonary embolization may result. Gelfoam, coils, and glue are more effective than microspheres for embolization of large arteries associated with acute obstetrical hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, or some fistula.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">UTERINE FIBROIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is based upon the hypothesis that reduction of myometrial arterial blood flow will result in infarction of fibroids and control symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is an option for symptomatic premenopausal women who wish to retain their uterus, escape side effects associated with prolonged medical therapy, and avoid surgical treatment (eg, hysterectomy, myomectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. UFE is rarely indicated in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other relative contraindications to UFE include current use of GnRH analogs, submucosal fibroids, and, possibly, plans for future pregnancy. The procedure is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-treatment-with-uterine-artery-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Treatment with uterine artery embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ADENOMYOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomyosis refers to the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature (uterine adenomyomatosis). Approximately 50 percent of affected women have co-existent fibroids and the symptoms of the two conditions often overlap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As a result, uterine artery embolizations (UAE) have been performed in many women with both fibroids and adenomyosis without a clear understanding of what proportion of the patient's symptoms were related to one condition or the other. Nevertheless, UAE has generally led to relief of symptoms (eg, bleeding, pain) in these patients and follow-up imaging has documented morphologic regression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53441%7EOBGYN%2F66196\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53441 graphicRef66196 \">image 1A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These observations led to investigation of UAE for treatment of symptomatic adenomyosis in women without coexistent fibroids. Over 90 percent of patients had resolution or significant reduction of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia over short-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. However, limited data suggest these benefits may not be durable: the frequency of recurrent adenomyosis after UAE (up to 44 percent) was greater than the reported frequency of recurrent fibroids after UFE (10 to 15 percent).</p><p>One study indicated that UAE for adenomyosis is effective in the management of symptomatic adenomyosis without coexisting fibroids and has an acceptable long-term success rate (57.4 percent) with mean follow-up of 4.9 years on 54 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. UAE should be considered an alternative to surgical option for patients with symptomatic adenomyosis. There was immediate treatment failure (7.4 percent), and relapses (35.2 percent) and 9.2 percent of patients underwent hysterectomy because of symptom recurrence.</p><p>UAE for management of adenomyosis related symptoms is a nonsurgical option for patients who did not respond to other therapies and want to avoid hysterectomy, the only definitive therapy. While the preliminary experiences presented in literature appear encouraging, larger prospective studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this procedure for patients with adenomyosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the uterus is a rare cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but it can result in severe hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Uterine artery embolization is the most common treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women#H3057969\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;, section on 'Arteriovenous malformation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PELVIC CONGESTION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 15 percent of premenopausal women have pelvic varicosities and venous stasis, as demonstrated by pelvic venography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73402\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73402 \">image 2</a>), but few experience symptoms. Pelvic congestion syndrome is the term used to describe the subset of these women who have pain and other symptoms in the uterus, ovaries, and vulva that cannot be attributed to any other cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gynecologic examinations are frequently normal in these women. Routine imaging studies may miss ovarian varicosities since the studies are performed in supine position when the veins are flaccid. Ovarian venography may be considered to confirm the suspected diagnosis since it can be performed in the upright or semi-upright position with a tilting table.</p><p>Venography involves catheterization of the right and left ovarian veins via a percutaneous femoral or jugular approach. Ovarian venograms in patients with pelvic congestion syndrome usually demonstrate abnormally dilated ovarian veins (&gt;10 mm in diameter), reflux causing congestion of the ovarian venous plexus, uterine venous engorgement, and filling of pelvic veins across the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>After these diagnostic studies, a therapeutic procedure may be done by embolizing the ovarian vein with coils or a sclerosing agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52370%7EOBGYN%2F66177\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52370 graphicRef66177 \">image 3A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FALLOPIAN TUBE RECANALIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubal abnormalities account for a significant proportion of female infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a>.) Selective salpingography is a diagnostic procedure in which a catheter is placed in the tubal ostium and contrast media is injected directly into the fallopian tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This technique helps to differentiate spasm from true obstruction and to clarify discordant findings from other tests. If persistent proximal tubal occlusion is documented, fallopian tube recanalization may be attempted using a microcatheter and guidewire system to recanalize the occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68677%7EOBGYN%2F63310%7EOBGYN%2F76139\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68677 graphicRef63310 graphicRef76139 \">image 4A-C</a>).</p><p>There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating this technique. In observational studies, pregnancy rates after the procedure are difficult to compare because of the multifactorial causes of infertility, but are reported to range from 9 to 56 percent (average 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. The optimum treatment for woman with tubal occlusion is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Procedures for improving tubal patency'</a>.)</p><p>Complications of fallopian tube recanalization are uncommon and include tubal perforation (2 percent), ectopic pregnancy (3 to 9 percent) percent, pelvic infection (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-27</a>].</p><p>Ovarian exposure to radiation is approximately 1 rad (10 mGy), a dose that is considered within acceptable limits for women of reproductive age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The procedure is performed in the follicular phase of the ovulatory cycle to try to ensure that the woman is not pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although selective salpingography and tubal catheterization under fluoroscopic guidance has been endorsed by professional societies such as the American Fertility Society in 1993 and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1998, it is still only offered by a few tertiary reproductive medicine units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The reasons for this might be due to concern about the technical difficulty of the procedure and the consequences of irradiation of ovaries in premenopausal women, as well as being a method relevant only to infertile women with proximal tubal blockage, a relatively infrequent presentation.</p><p>A wider role for selective salpingography and tubal catheterization in the management of infertility has been advocated since the technique is relatively simple, requires only modest equipment, and appears to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Its use may reduce the utilization of more expensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Falloposcopic tuboplasty has been reported as an alternative to fluoroscopic fallopian tube recanalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMOR-RELATED BLEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding from gynecologic malignancies is initially managed by conservative measures, such as vaginal packing, transfusion, or <span class=\"nowrap\">radiation/chemotherapy</span>. If these conservative treatments fail or bleeding worsens with rapid deterioration of the patient's condition, transcatheter embolization should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. PTE has been used in management of intractable internal or external bleeding caused by both gynecologic malignancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69084%7EOBGYN%2F80352\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69084 graphicRef80352 \">image 5A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55631%7EOBGYN%2F68325%7EOBGYN%2F79711\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55631 graphicRef68325 graphicRef79711 \">image 6A-C</a>) and tumors metastatic to the vulvovaginal area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59211%7EOBGYN%2F69719%7EOBGYN%2F79523\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59211 graphicRef69719 graphicRef79523 \">image 7A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Early angiographic intervention can reduce the need for an immediate or subsequent surgical procedure and allow conservative management followed by disease-specific therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Several small series have reported successful cessation of malignancy-associated bleeding after embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In one series, immediate cessation of pelvic bleeding occurred in 17 cervical cancer patients; however, repeat embolization was necessary in seven patients (41 percent) due to recurrent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The risk of recurrent bleeding can be reduced by superselective embolization of the artery feeding the tumor and use of permanent particulate embolic agents, such as polyvinyl alcohol particles or tris-acryl gelatin microspheres.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">UTERINE HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resuscitation and stabilization are the initial focus of intervention in patients who are hemorrhaging from the uterus. After these initial procedures, PTE techniques offer a safe and effective alternative to surgery for controlling acute uterine hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Most such cases involve postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], but the discussion below also applies to gynecological causes of acute uterine hemorrhage. In addition, PTE has been used in managing vulvovaginal hematomas refractory to conventional first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. Preoperative placement of balloon catheters has also been used to prevent or reduce intraoperative hemorrhage in women with suspected placenta accreta undergoing cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although many patients will stop bleeding spontaneously or with conservative treatment, consultation with an interventional radiologist should be obtained early in the patient's course. This facilitates decision making about the possible need for and timing of a procedure. Furthermore, the physician needs to consider that if embolization is unsuccessful, uterine artery ligation can be attempted subsequently. In contrast, embolization after a failed uterine artery ligation may be more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], although not impossible. In one study, arterial embolization was successful in 10 of 11 cases of failed surgical ligation therapy for postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Thus, uterine arterial embolization should be considered an option even after failed surgical ligation due to <span class=\"nowrap\">incomplete/ineffective</span> occlusion.</p><p>Decision making and mobilization of personnel and appropriate equipment take time and, in some cases, a significant delay is likely before the uterine vessels can be occluded. Laparotomy should be performed if the woman is not stable enough to wait for the embolization procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Once the angiographic procedure is anticipated, we suggest the following preprocedure laboratory tests: complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, and platelet count. If coagulopathy is present, we prefer that it be corrected before the procedure, although some radiologists will go ahead while the coagulopathy is being treated since the hemorrhage is generally the cause of the coagulopathy. We consider coagulopathy a relative contraindication to elective interventional procedures; however, under emergency situations, it can be performed as a life saving measure even with coagulopathy.</p><p>The technique of embolization is basically the same as with other embolization procedures (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transcatheter embolization procedure'</a> above). Diagnostic angiography is initially performed to look for a bleeding site or abnormal vascular findings, such as extravasation, abnormal arteriovenous communication, pseudoaneurysm, spasm, or truncation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67041%7EOBGYN%2F78839\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67041 graphicRef78839 \">image 8A-B</a>). Gelfoam is the preferred agent for embolization of the uterine or hypogastric arteries since the duration of occlusion is temporary (two to six weeks), but sufficient to reduce hemorrhage. Slow development of collateral arterial flow occurs a few hours after embolization and serves to prevent ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/35,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,46</a>].</p><p>The patient's physician should monitor her status in the angiography suite at the time of the procedure and be ready to proceed to surgical intervention if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. Frequent communication about the patient's status between the interventional radiologist and the physician is recommended. A prolonged embolization procedure should be avoided if there appears to be little chance of therapeutic success because the patient's condition may deteriorate and increase the risk of surgical intervention.</p><p>If the time permits, angiographic occlusion balloon catheters can be placed to temporarily occlude the hypogastric or common iliac arteries (or even in the aorta) while en route to the operating room or during the surgery. Prolonged (48 hours) balloon catheter occlusion of the hypogastric arteries alone, without embolization, also was reported to successfully control hemorrhage in two hemodynamically unstable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>A literature review of UAE for treatment of pelvic hemorrhage unrelated to malignancy reported a 97 percent success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another review described a 95 percent success rate in controlling bleeding related to postpartum hemorrhage; the failure rate was low (5 percent of cases required hysterectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A large series of 100 cases performed at a single center mostly by one radiologist reported 89 percent success for control of postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Serious complications are unusual and the procedure-related morbidity of 3 to 6 percent is much less than with laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders/abstract/43,44,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,48</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Uterine hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's physician should monitor her status in the angiography suite at the time of an embolization procedure and be ready to proceed to surgical intervention if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. A prolonged embolization procedure should be avoided if there appears to be little chance of therapeutic success because the patient's condition may deteriorate and increase the risk of surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Uterine hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparotomy should be performed if the woman is not stable enough to wait for the embolization procedure or for completion of a difficult procedure. If the time permits, angiographic occlusion balloon catheters can be placed to temporarily occlude the hypogastric or common iliac arteries (or even in the aorta) while en route to the operating room or during the surgery.
