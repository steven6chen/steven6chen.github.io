It helps the blood carry oxygen. Heme also has other important roles in the body.</p><p>There are about 8 different kinds of porphyrias. Most of these are caused by abnormal genes that are passed on in families, but it is possible be the first person in a family to have porphyria. The most common porphyria is called &quot;porphyria cutanea tarda,&quot; or &quot;PCT.&quot; It can be caused by abnormal genes or by some chemicals, alcohol, or liver infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632285699\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of porphyrias?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the porphyrias causes different symptoms. In general, they can be divided into 2 main types, &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;cutaneous,&quot; which are described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute porphyrias</strong> &ndash; Acute porphyrias cause &quot;attacks&quot; that last a few days to 2 weeks. These attacks can cause:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Belly pain (this is the most common symptom)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Constipation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizures (convulsions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weakness, numbness, tingling, or problems with sensation (caused by nerve damage)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paralysis of the muscles that control breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tiredness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Red or dark colored urine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anxiety, confusion, or depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutaneous porphyrias</strong> &ndash; Cutaneous porphyrias affect the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. These porphyrias can cause:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blisters on the skin (especially on the face and backs of the hands)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin pain, itching, and swelling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tiredness (caused by having too few red blood cells)</p><p/><p>Some porphyrias cause symptoms of both acute and cutaneous porphyrias.</p><p>Some people have symptoms of porphyria when they are children. Some do not have symptoms until they are adults.</p><p>The symptoms of the different porphyrias can also get better or worse depending on a lot of factors. Your doctor or nurse can tell you if you need to avoid certain medicines, alcohol, smoking, or other things.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632285714\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor suspects that you have a porphyria, you will need tests done on your blood, urine, and sometimes a sample of bowel movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632285731\"><span class=\"h1\">How are the porphyrias treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a porphyria, make sure the doctor treating you knows a lot about the condition. Porphyrias are not very common, so many doctors do not have a lot of experience treating them.</p><p>Each of the porphyrias is treated differently.

In general, people being treated for a porphyria might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get fluids through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV,&quot; to treat dehydration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hemin</a> (also through an IV), which replaces the heme the body would normally make</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to wear special clothes and sunblock to protect their skin from the sun</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to avoid some medicines (if this applies to you, your doctor will give you a list), cigarettes, alcohol, or anything that makes the porphyria worse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have blood removed (this is a lot like donating blood)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to make sure to eat at regular times, because going without food for too long can make symptoms worse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to take a vitamin called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">beta-carotene</a>, which can make the skin less sensitive to the sun</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take pain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632285746\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can have children if you have a porphyria. If you want to have children, ask your doctor or nurse whether you might pass your condition on to your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H632285761\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having a porphyria can be very hard for some people. In some cases, the symptoms can be painful, scary, and confusing. If you are having trouble coping with your condition, talk to your doctor or nurse.
