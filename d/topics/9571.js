In practical terms, most injections into joints consist of a glucocorticoid, a local anesthetic, or a combination of the two. Occasionally saline is injected into the joint to diagnose a joint injury.</p><p>This topic will review the basic technique of inserting a needle into a joint and the main indications for intraarticular steroid injections. The same techniques apply for injection of the less commonly used hyaluronate viscosupplementation agents into knees, hips, and perhaps shoulders.</p><p>The choice of injectable glucocorticoid and whether it should be combined with a local anesthetic, the frequency of injection, and potential complications that can occur are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications&quot;</a>). The injection of saline (ie, saline load test), used to diagnose traumatic arthrotomy, is also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient#H151204470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;, section on 'Soft tissue and bone assessment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8657122\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ASPIRATION OR INJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of indications, both diagnostic and therapeutic, for joint aspiration or injection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62905\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62905 \">table 1</a>). Arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis are important in the evaluation of a patient who has an effusion or signs suggesting inflammation within the joint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The two most important indications for diagnosis are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for sepsis in a single inflamed joint, particularly in diabetic lower extremities or in patients with poor follow-up, as in urban emergency wards. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.) It has been estimated that 5 percent of inflammatory presentations in the emergency department turn out to be combined gout and infection in the same joint at the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Gram stain is incompletely sensitive in septic joints. Centrifuging the synovial fluid sample marginally improves the accuracy of the crystal exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial confirmation of gouty arthritis by polarized light. More than twice as much <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> is prescribed in the United States and Canada as would be taken if all patients with gout were taking the medication all the time. The reason for overprescription of allopurinol is its use in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia in the absence of crystal proof of gout. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The main therapeutic indications for steroid injections are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of joints with inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], spondyloarthropathies) which have enjoyed long periods (one to six months) of near remission from previous injections. Such an approach may also be chondroprotective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of soft tissue structures such as the subdeltoid bursa, trochanteric bursa, and tendon sheathing. Soft tissue injections can be curative in some cases. However, short-term pain relief does not ensure a better long-term outcome. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Elbow (lateral epicondyle)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Weaker indications or uses for injection of glucocorticoid are osteoarthritis (OA) of large weightbearing joints and repetitive injection of small joints of the hands, which can become more deformed if their ligamentous support atrophies due to injection. Injection of the carpometacarpal joint with glucocorticoids was no more effective than placebo (saline) injections in one small double-blind study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In another randomized study of 52 patients, both hyaluronate and corticosteroid injections improved grip strength and pain in OA of the thumb (trapeziometacarpal) joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to glucocorticoid injection, the patient should be educated about appropriate postinjection care and possible complications. A survey of about one-quarter of the members of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) found that 71 percent of rheumatologists ask patients to decrease weightbearing, often for 48 hours, after injection of a weightbearing joint, that 30 percent advise applying ice to the injected joint, and that 29 percent specifically caution about either infection or postinjection flare.</p><p>Although it is rare (1 in 3500 procedures in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]), infection is the complication that most justifies routine patient education. There are two other major components of patient education:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Description of the more common local postinjection flare (up to 20 percent in muscular trigger or tender point injections), which is easily confused with infection. Infection should be suspected if the flare lasts longer than or begins later than 48 hours after injection. Other findings suggestive of an iatrogenic septic joint include a crescendo pattern of pain, redness or drainage around the injection site, and fever or malaise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The flushing reaction seen in up to 10 percent of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (Kenalog).</p><p/><p>Leakage of joint fluid, like infection, occurs rarely and does not necessarily lead to infection. Nevertheless, this complication should prompt a repeat visit to the clinician. Leakage is particularly likely to occur in two settings: drainage of a popliteal (Baker's) cyst, and aspiration of an interphalangeal joint with a needle that is too large (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Needle size'</a> below). Likewise, if a larger bore needle is used to evacuate viscous material in a cyst over a Heberden's node, the patient might be cautioned about leaking from the site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE OF ARTHROCENTESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors must be taken into account when performing arthrocentesis, including needle and syringe size, skin sterilization, and local anesthesia.</p><p>Patients who are receiving anticoagulation at therapeutic levels can generally undergo arthrocentesis safely. (See <a href=\"#H8656865\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient on anticoagulants'</a> below.)</p><p>Image-guided approaches may be valuable to assure needle placement when aspirating certain joints, such as the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ultrasound guidance is increasingly used even for the more accessible joints, such as knees and shoulders, and can improve accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but it may add to the cost of an injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8656624\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal needle size for most taps is probably 22 gauge; smaller for small joints, such as interphalangeal joints; and larger if the effusion is a large knee collection, if smaller needles have failed, and if very viscous pus is suspected. As an example, drainage of a popliteal cyst can be safely performed with a 20 or 18 gauge needle, but the site should be bandaged with a pressure dressing since the frequency of leaking and pain are much greater with large needles. The high viscosity of the material within a popliteal cyst tempts the operator to use a still larger bore needle, a procedure which we do not advise.</p><p>The best strategy is to use one needle and syringe size as much as possible. Getting used to the resistance offered by injecting through the same needle and syringe size allows the operator to more immediately and reliably recognize the higher resistance that comes with attempting to inject with the needle tip in tendon substance. This cautionary higher resistance is easier to perceive with a 22-gauge needle or larger and more difficult to appreciate with a smaller bore needle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Syringe size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 5 mL syringe is often the ideal size. The 3 mL syringe may not create enough vacuum, while a larger syringe may create too much suction and may bring debris or a synovial frond into the bevel of the needle, physically blocking aspiration. If, however, a knee effusion or shoulder effusion is of obviously large magnitude, a 20 gauge needle and 20 mL (or even 50 mL) syringe are standard. On the other hand, small-volume tendon sheath injections performed by a subspecialist are often best accomplished with tuberculin-sized syringes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Removing hair at the aspiration site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shaving the site has been shown to be of no net value due to exposure of more staphylococci within hair follicles disturbed by the removal of the top layer of epidermis during shaving. It is difficult to imagine a sterile preparation of all surfaces of a long hair shaft. Using a scissor to cut hairs which may otherwise brush against the shaft of the entering needle may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sterile preparation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1074170\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best method to sterilize the skin is similar to preparation for a blood culture: three separate concentric outward spirals with an iodine disinfectant or a scrub with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> prep kit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since arthrocentesis is not life-saving or time-limited, there is generally no reason to touch the previously prepared site with a gloved finger. If the initial site chosen seems wrong, a different site should be identified, palpated, and sterilized.</p><p>Two consequences follow from these principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile gloves are not necessary since the gloved hand will not touch the prepared field. Unsterile clean gloves are mandated as a universal precaution, since HIV and hepatitis have grown from synovial fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful initial palpation and marking of the site obviates the need for repeat preparation. Flexing the joint to be sure of the location of the actual articulation helps initial site selection. Marking is done by impressing the skin with a hard object, such as the sterile end of the needle sheath or a ball point pen with a retractable writing tip.</p><p/><p>One form of commonly used topical anesthetic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethyl-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethyl chloride</a> spray, which is labeled as nonsterile, is typically applied after the skin preparation, although it can be used safely for these procedures in our experience. In a small study that examined the effects of the spray on skin sterility, the use of ethyl chloride spray did not alter the sterility of skin at mock injection sites when it was applied following preparation of the sites with 70 percent isopropyl alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Local anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p>It is very unlikely that randomized trials will be performed that are of sufficient power to determine the optimal approach to skin preparation before arthrocentesis, given the very low rate of infectious complications (estimated at most to be approximately 1 in 3500 procedures). The use of these approaches (an iodine-based or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> based scrub) is supported by indirect evidence from their benefit for more common procedures, including blood culture and surgery. We do not perform joint aspiration or injection following skin preparation with alcohol alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H24969720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Skin antisepsis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1074161\"><span class=\"h3\">Single versus multidose medication vials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer the use of single-dose medication vials rather than multidose vials because of the risk of microbial contamination of multidose vials of glucocorticoids or local anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. In settings in which multidose vials of medications are used, we advise meticulous attention to sterile procedure and appropriate storage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Local anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bleb of subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, or, prior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> preparation, a short burst (10 to 15 seconds) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethyl-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethyl chloride</a> spray, a rapidly evaporating coolant, may be beneficial. In our experience, either approach helps to alleviate the pain associated with insertion of the needle through the skin. Additionally, mixing lidocaine with the glucocorticoid injection may reduce symptomatic postinjection flares, especially with extraarticular injections.</p><p>The alternative technique without anesthesia relies upon a quick, sure puncture through both pain sensitive structures (skin and joint capsule) with the smallest possible needle. It is best reserved for patients well-known to the operator.</p><p>Disadvantages of the anesthesia techniques, which limit their use, involve the following theoretical concerns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The methylparaben preservatives in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> may decrease sensitivity of synovial fluid culture if some of the lidocaine is included in the culture sample.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad technique with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethyl-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethyl chloride</a> spray is probably a risk. Spraying from too close creates splatter; while spraying from too far requires adjustment of aim, implying the potential for washing contamination from the periphery of the field toward the center.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of multidose vials, even those with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> plus bacteriostatic agents, does not eliminate all risk of contamination. (See <a href=\"#H1074161\" class=\"local\">'Single versus multidose medication vials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Switching syringes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hemostat can be used to grip the more distal half of the needle hub, which has specially made fins to accommodate this maneuver, when the operator desires to change syringes during the procedure. Gripping the more proximal round portion of the hub should be avoided, since it may persistently deform the aperture into an oval shape, ruining the airtight connection between the syringe and needle.</p><p>Why would one want to change syringes in mid-procedure? A trivial reason is that the first syringe may fill up. The more important reason is that it is good policy to look at the fluid for gross (not necessarily microscopic) inspection prior to injecting glucocorticoid. In approximately 15 percent of cases, gross inspection prompts a formal study of fluid (culture, white blood cell count, or crystal examination under polarized light). There are many patients in whom the diagnosis is clear, and there is no compelling reason that they cannot be injected directly. Gout and, less frequently, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) produce synovial fluids with white cell counts greater than 50,000, falsely suggesting infection; nevertheless, unexpectedly viscous fluids should be cultured. Even an unexpectedly watery fluid with low viscosity but high turbidity may suggest infection and may warrant culture.</p><p>Aspirating a joint to reduce the size of an effusion prior to injection of glucocorticoid may improve outcome, at least for patients with RA involving the knee. As an example, 191 knees (of 147 patients with RA) were randomly assigned to be aspirated or not prior to injection of 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> hexacetonide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; relapse of a joint effusion was noted in 23 percent of those who were aspirated versus 47 percent of those who were not (p = 0.001).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8656865\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the patient on anticoagulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on limited data and our experience, we generally perform arthrocentesis and injections in patients on anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) without altering the anticoagulation regimen. As discussed above, we prefer to use a 22-gauge needle, although larger needles may also be safe for use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Needle size'</a> above.)</p><p>The available data regarding the use of arthrocentesis or injection in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or DOACs suggest that these procedures are generally safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the larger studies to assess the safety of arthrocentesis in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is a retrospective analysis involving 640 arthrocentesis and joint injection procedures in 514 anticoagulated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There was no significant difference in early and late complications of the procedure (clinically significant bleeding, procedure-related pain prompting a clinician visit, and joint infection) in patients receiving therapeutic levels of anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] &ge;2.0) compared with patients with nontherapeutic levels (INR &lt;2.0).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling&quot;, section on 'Joint aspiration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8656706\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFICULT SITES TO ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some target sites for needle placement may be difficult to access.

As an example, small-volume knee effusions are more likely to lateralize to the lateral suprapatellar pouch than the medial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Ultrasonography can be used for direct guidance of needle insertion, with concurrent ultrasound visualization of the area for injection, or for indirect guidance, in which the target region is visualized for the purpose of marking the needle insertion site and estimating the depth and direction of needle placement. The use of ultrasound guidance in rheumatology practice continues to evolve and is discussed in detail separately.

Arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis are important in the evaluation of patients who have an effusion or signs suggesting inflammation within the joint. Important indications for synovial fluid analysis include evaluation for a possible septic joint and initial diagnostic confirmation of suspected gouty arthritis. Therapeutic intraarticular or soft tissue injection of glucocorticoids is indicated for a number of disorders.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of factors must be taken into account when performing arthrocentesis. These include needle and syringe size, which depends upon the region targeted and the potential size of a joint effusion; careful skin sterilization; and local anesthesia, usually with either subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> injection or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethyl-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethyl chloride</a> spray.
