As an example, in the United States, 20 percent of women are estimated to undergo some type of urogynecologic procedure in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These warnings apply to transvaginal prolapse repair procedures and not to transabdominal prolapse procedures (ie, sacrocervicopexy) or mesh-based incontinence surgery (ie, midurethral slings). We do not perform laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy due to high rates of mesh erosion associated with mesh placement at the time of total hysterectomy. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, even with mesh procedures to which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning does not specifically apply, we still incorporate the small chance of mesh complication into our preoperative discussion with the patient. Specialized patient information and consent forms are available from the <a href=\"https://www.augs.org/&amp;token=j+tF41plvYHq0KcVLVNCgp+8zHRdERsqAg3sVoZFZaI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=91017\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Urogynecologic Society</a>.

While power morcellation may be selected by some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], additional options to avoid morcellation or minimize risk should be considered. Although increases in major surgical, non-transfusion complications and 30-day hospital readmissions have increased since the 2014 FDA warnings, rates of all major surgical complications and hospital reoperations have not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Given the controversy regarding power morcellation, we no longer perform laparoscopic power morcellation for supracervical hysterectomy. Typically, one of the laparoscopic port incisions can be extended to accommodate hand morcellation in a bag for extraction of the uterus and adnexa. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraperitoneal surgery &ndash; Women undergoing intraperitoneal surgery who do not desire future childbearing have the option of elective bilateral salpingectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy to reduce their risk of ovarian cancer. The evidence regarding prophylactic salpingectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy continues to emerge. The approach depends on the risk for ovarian cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women at low risk of ovarian cancer undergoing intraperitoneal procedures, our practice is to offer elective salpingectomy to low-risk women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

For women who continue to desire bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, we counsel them regarding the 12 percent risk of failed removal with an isolated vaginal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For those women who definitively desire oophorectomy at the time of vaginal repair, we review the possible need for laparoscopic assistance to safely complete the removal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with abnormal findings or women at high risk of ovarian cancer, we offer bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17989867\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing with regards to childbearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the impact of subsequent pregnancy and delivery on outcomes of pelvic reconstructive surgery. However, in general, we encourage women to wait until they have completed childbearing prior to undergoing surgical repairs. In rare situations, such as women with severe symptoms uncontrolled by conservative measures, complete anal sphincter disruptions, or obstetric fistulas, these procedures are offered prior to completion of childbearing with counseling that subsequent pregnancy and delivery may disrupt the repair, cause worsening of symptoms, and make repeat correction more difficult. Data regarding the impact of vaginal delivery after pelvic floor surgery are sparse; however, we generally advise cesarean section for delivery after pelvic reconstructive surgery for prolapse or fistula repair. Data regarding vaginal delivery after midurethral slings are also limited; however, small case series suggest rare reoccurrence of incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, we do not consider prior midurethral sling an absolute contraindication to subsequent vaginal delivery. The risks of recurrence of pelvic floor conditions and damage to repair must be weighed against the risks of cesarean section and should be individualized to the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6905637\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of preoperative tests and studies is determined by the woman's history, physical examination, and planned procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54943150\"><span class=\"h3\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many preoperative components are the same for urogynecologic surgery, benign gynecologic surgery, and general surgery.

MBP is uncomfortable and inconvenient, and potentially causes harmful electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Similarly, antibiotic bowel preparation is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Since colpocleisis is often performed in women who are unable to tolerate more invasive procedures, this population has a high prevalence of other comorbidities.

Additional considerations are important for urogynecologic procedures, specifically. As examples, stirrups for leg elevation must be supportive and non-compressive as the woman may be in dorsal lithotomy position for several hours. Female pelvic reconstructive surgeries may involve moving the operative table, arm boards, or patient's legs; care must be taken to ensure that no soft tissue or limb is trapped during these maneuvers. When Trendelenburg position will be used, the physiologic impact of this position is discussed with the anesthesia team and measures are taken to prevent the patient from sliding off the operative table. Obese women may be positioned with their buttocks slightly overhanging the operative table to allow entry to the vaginal canal. Additional instruments may be needed to accommodate increased abdominal thickness or vaginal depth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H2372373\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p>Prevention of nerve injury, particularly for women in dorsal lithotomy position, is reviewed in detail separately.

There is no evidence to support the use of one stirrup over the other. However, in our experience, use of candy cane stirrups appears to increase rates of transient femoral neuropathy. Thus, we use Allen stirrups for longer reconstructive procedures where risks of prolonged nerve compression are higher. Regardless of stirrup choice, it is important that knees and hips remain flexed at 90-degree angles and that the <span class=\"nowrap\">knee/leg</span> does not rest on the stirrups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107011 \">figure 1</a>). This neurologically neutral position prevents over flexion of the <span class=\"nowrap\">hip/knee</span> joints or compression against the stirrups, which can result in femoral or lateral peroneal nerve injuries. The position of arms is dictated by the preferences of the anesthesiology team because the location of the arms does not impact vaginal access. We typically secure the arms to padded arm boards to ensure they remain in a neurologically neutral position for the duration of the surgery to the abdomen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing open, laparoscopic, or robotic procedures, we prefer supportive, boot-type stirrups (eg, Allen stirrups) because they allow for easy transition from vaginal to abdominal procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107013 \">figure 2</a>). We prefer to pad and tuck the patient's arms in military position (ie, arms at sides with palms facing toward lateral thighs) to protect the arms and facilitate the surgeon's access to the abdominal surgical field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107012 \">figure 3</a>). Tucking the patient's arms reduces the risk of nerve and vascular injuries that can occur when arms are fixed to boards that are then moved too far cephalad during the procedure.

While povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is commonly used in the United States for vaginal preparation, chlorhexidine is commonly used elsewhere because it may provide a greater reduction in skin flora than PVP-I and is not inactivated in the presence of blood. Either PVP-I or chlorhexidine gluconate with a low concentration of isopropyl alcohol is acceptable for vaginal preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The timing of catheter insertion varies with the procedure. For women undergoing open, laparoscopic, or robotic procedures, we generally insert a bladder catheter on the sterile field at the start of the surgery. For women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy, we insert the bladder catheter after<em> </em>anterior colpotomy to facilitate visualization of the vesicovaginal junction. However, this practice varies, and it is reasonable to drain the bladder prior to the anterior colpotomy. The bladder catheter is removed to perform cystourethroscopy and then reinserted at the conclusion of cystourethroscopy. Removal is attempted as soon as the patient is ambulatory, generally on postoperative day 0 or 1. </p><p>Postoperative bladder catheter removal is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H181480731\" class=\"local\">'Catheter removal and voiding trial'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181480694\"><span class=\"h2\">Retractor use in surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate visualization is essential to all surgical procedures. Self-retaining retractors can be advantageous in urogynecologic procedures because the operative field may be quite small and limit the ability of assistants to use handheld retractors. Retractor selection varies by type of procedure, surgeon preference, and retractor availability. For open abdominal surgery, we use a self-retaining retractor such as the O'Sullivan-O'Connor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61098\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61098 \">figure 4</a>) or Turner-Warwick given their ease of placement and ability to vary blade position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103635\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103635 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103636 \">picture 2</a>). Some surgeons prefer the Bookwalter retractor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79154\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79154 \">figure 5</a>) because of the versatility of the retractor blade location and the variable depth of the blades; however, this requires attachment to the surgical table and tends to add more time to set up than the self-retaining retractors. Regardless of which self-retaining retractor is used, care must be taken to avoid bowel entrapment (any of the blades) and compression of the femoral nerve (lateral blades). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;</a>.). </p><p>For vaginal surgery, we do not typically use a separate retractor as we generally have two surgical assistants to expose for the primary surgeon. However, in settings where surgical assistants are limited or exposure is difficult, vaginal retracting systems (eg, Lone Star) provide exposure and visualization without taking up significant space. When using a self-retaining vaginal retractor, the hooks must be anchored deeply enough to avoid tearing the tissue when tensioned. Other retractors for vaginal surgery include the Rigby vaginal retractor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67616 \">figure 6</a>) and the Gelpi perineal retractor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65767 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181480700\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative cystourethroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative cystourethroscopy is done to rule out cystotomy, diagnose intravesical or intraurethral suture or mesh, verify bilateral ureteral patency, and evaluate for fluid extravasation after bladder surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. We typically perform intraoperative cystourethroscopy during all prolapse and incontinence procedures, during any procedure involving apical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior prolapse repair, and any time there is concern for urogenital tract injury.

In these cases, if we have any concern for ureteral patency or bladder injury, we perform an intraoperative cystourethroscopy. Procedures that do not involve the bladder or anterior vesicle space, such as isolated rectocele repair, do not warrant cystourethroscopy.

However, there was a nonsignificant trend toward fewer hematomas in the women with vaginal packs. In a trial of 77 women randomly assigned to vaginal pack or no pack after pelvic reconstructive surgery, the women who received a vaginal pack had lower pain scores documented by the nursing staff and used less postoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Because there have been case reports of retained vaginal packs, it is imperative to document in the operative report that a vaginal pack has been placed and then document removal (typically postoperative day 1). A suture tied to the pack and taped to the patient's leg or the urethral catheter can be an extra reminder the pack is in place. Some institutions require placement of an armband on the patient when the pack is placed and the armband is removed at the same time as the vaginal pack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1796097167\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation of analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection of long-acting analgesics at the completion of surgery have been demonstrated to reduce postoperative pain and narcotic use in multiple types of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain#H795594581\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;, section on 'Special populations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-recovery-after-gynecologic-surgery-components-and-implementation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced recovery after gynecologic surgery: Components and implementation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the patient is ready to leave the post-anesthesia care unit, medication selection depends on drug availability, side effects, and patient tolerance. Our approach aims to minimize narcotic use. We give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (max 3000 mg per day), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a>. In patients who cannot take tramadol due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or monoamine oxidase inhibitors use or other contraindication, we give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>. Women with normal renal function receive intravenous ketorolac 30 mg (in women over age 65 we reduce the dose to 15 mg) every six hours for a total of up to 24 hours. Breakthrough pain is treated with intravenous narcotics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> 0.2 mg every four hours as needed or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> 5 mg every four hours).</p><p>Prior to discharge home we transition from intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> to scheduled oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>. In our practice, we prescribe oral ibuprofen 600 mg to be taken every six hours with food and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> 1000 mg every 8 hours. As the patient's pain lessens, she can move from scheduled ibuprofen dosing to as-needed dosing. This transition generally occurs over two to five days for minimally invasive surgeries, and will take longer for open abdominal procedures. In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> is provided for breakthrough pain. For women who cannot take or have insufficient pain reduction with this regimen, we prescribe 5 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> tablets and instruct the patient to take one to two tablets orally every six hours as needed. No more than a seven day supply of opioid medication is given. Written instructions are provided to explain the use of these medications. When prescribing combination medications that include acetaminophen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> and acetaminophen, commercial name Vicodin), the clinician must ensure that the patient's intake of acetaminophen does not exceed 3 grams per 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181480731\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter removal and voiding trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to patient discharge, a voiding trial is performed to ensure adequate bladder function. The voiding trial is done as soon as women are able to ambulate (outpatients) or on the first postoperative day (inpatients).</p><p>In our practice, we perform a retrograde voiding trial. First, we have the patient stand at the bedside to drain the bladder catheter completely. Once empty, we then retrograde fill her bladder with 300 mL of sterile water or saline followed by immediate catheter removal. The patient is allowed 10 minutes to void. She must void 200 mL or more to demonstrate adequate voiding function. If available, we also request a bladder ultrasound assessment of the postvoid residual volume to confirm that the residual volume is not in excess of 100 mL. Most women with unsuccessful voiding trials are discharged home with a temporary indwelling bladder catheter. However, some women opt to perform clean intermittent self-catheterization and are taught this technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women#H59943855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative urinary retention in women&quot;, section on 'Voiding trials'</a>.)</p><p>An exception to this practice is made for women who have bladder surgery or injury. These women keep the bladder catheter in place for 7 to 14 days, depending upon the size and location of the injury, to minimize the risk of fistula formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. There is little evidence to guide recommendations for duration of catheterization and imaging after bladder injury. For large defects or fistula repairs we typically perform a computed tomography cystourethrogram prior to permanently removing the catheter. This is done with a retrograde fill of contrast dye to 300 mL to document the integrity of the repair prior to catheter removal. A less costly and simple office procedure to assess for vesicovaginal fistula involves a retrograde fill of indigo or methylene blue-stained saline to 300 mL via bladder catheter followed by a careful vaginal examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tampon insertion to assess for extravasation and ensure the integrity of the repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181480743\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we treat women with midurethral sling procedures with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrofurantoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrofurantoin</a> 100 mg orally twice a day for three days postoperatively to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, if the patient is allergic to nitrofurantoin or there are contraindications (eg, renal failure), we do not substitute broader spectrum antibiotics due to the additional risks of gastrointestinal upset, yeast infections, and bacterial resistance. Data are mixed regarding the benefits of prophylactic antibiotic use after midurethral sling surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Other clinicians may reasonably choose not to use antibiotics.</p><p>As with all surgeries, primary measures to prevent catheter-associated UTI are avoidance of unnecessary catheterization, use of sterile technique when placing the catheter, and removal of the catheter as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although some may provide <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 250 mg at the time of catheter removal if it has been in place for more than two days, this is not our routine practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Although prophylactic antibiotics are generally not recommended for patients with indwelling bladder catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>], women with an indwelling catheter after urogynecologic surgery are a unique subgroup. Studies of surgical patients who undergo short-term catheterization suggest that a brief course of antibiotics at the time of catheter removal may reduce infection risk. In a meta-analysis of six randomized and one non-randomized controlled trials, antibiotics given around the time of catheter removal reduced the absolute risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection by 5.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The patients in these studies were primarily surgical, including urologic surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56324753\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no evidence-based guidelines on the prevention of postoperative constipation in women undergoing urogynecologic surgery. We prescribe oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> sodium 100 mg twice a day for the first postoperative week or for the duration of narcotic pain medicine use. If this regimen is not adequate to maintain regular bowel function, we encourage the patient to add milk of magnesia, prunes, or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> suppository as needed. In a trial comparing oral docusate sodium alone with combined oral docusate sodium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (PEG3350) given for five days following urogynecologic surgery, the time to first bowel movement was the same for both groups, although the women taking PEG3350 were less likely to use additional laxatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Thus, PEG3350 does not appear to be beneficial in this postoperative group. If these interventions do not restore bowel function, we evaluate the patient for ileus or obstruction.</p><p>We call all patients two to three days after their procedure to answer questions or concerns, verify they have had a bowel movement, and provide recommendations for additional laxative use if needed. We do not recommend use of rectal suppositories in women who have undergone anal canal surgery (ie, hemorrhoidectomy or anal sphincter repairs), but do not limit use in rectocele repair or other prolapse surgery. If a patient has not had a bowel movement seven days after surgery, we recommend evaluation for possible disimpaction. If the patient does not have flatus or complains of <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span> in association with constipation, we recommend immediate evaluation for ileus or obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181480749\"><span class=\"h2\">Resumption of estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is little evidence to guide resumption of vaginal estrogen following pelvic reconstructive surgery, at least one small trial reported improved sexual health and quality of life in women using vaginal estriol gel after prolapse surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In our practice, we instruct patients to resume vaginal estrogen cream or tablets two weeks after surgery as that allows initial healing of any suture lines in the vagina and decreases complaints of bleeding from trauma of the applicator. Typically patients resume twice-weekly dosing as described above (see <a href=\"#H6905128\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal atrophy'</a> above). For patients using the vaginal estrogen ring, we advise waiting six weeks to resume use to avoid vaginal placement of a foreign body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H181480755\"><span class=\"h2\">Activity restrictions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We advise our patients to return to daily activities as tolerated. Randomized trials have failed to identify differences in short term outcomes with activity restriction compared with liberal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], and studies have demonstrated intraabdominal pressure increases are higher with involuntary actions such as coughing and sneezing than with activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. Therefore, we do not recommend specific activity restrictions except that we instruct the patient to abstain from vaginal intercourse or activity that may disrupt suture lines (eg, bicycle riding or straddle activity) for six weeks or until postoperative examination confirms complete wound healing. Patients are allowed to resume driving when they are no longer using narcotic pain medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4036134893\"><span class=\"h2\">Smokers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate pharmacotherapy should be initiated for smokers.

Early office evaluation is scheduled for women with persistent or unusual concerns. We have found that this practice results in high patient satisfaction and fewer after-hours calls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-patient-centered-view-of-the-clinician-patient-relationship#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A patient-centered view of the clinician-patient relationship&quot;, section on 'Emotional support and alleviation of fears and anxiety'</a>.)</p><p>Short-interval evaluation (two to four days) is automatically scheduled for women who had an unsuccessful postoperative voiding trial. The voiding trial is repeated in the outpatient setting (see <a href=\"#H181480688\" class=\"local\">'Bladder catheter'</a> above). Women who are unable to void at this time are taught clean intermittent self-catheterization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women#H59946467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative urinary retention in women&quot;, section on 'Clean intermittent catheterization'</a>.)</p><p>While women are seen at any time in the postoperative period if complications arise, the routine postoperative visit is scheduled four to six weeks from surgery. At this visit, abdominal and vaginal examinations are performed to ensure the incisions have healed and there is no evidence of mesh erosion or wound complications. The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) examination is repeated to document postoperative prolapse correction. We also routinely assess a postvoid residual to ensure the patient's bladder is emptying well. Pain management and bowel function are assessed and all questions are answered. We do not routinely refer postoperative women for physical therapy as it has not been shown to improve surgical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58020124\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with the following issues have unique additional perioperative care needs which are reviewed in detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetric anal sphincter laceration (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed surgical management of the disrupted anal sphincter&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetric fistula (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstetric-fistulas-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstetric fistulas in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urogenital tract fistula (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urogenital-tract-fistulas-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urogenital tract fistulas in women&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58019274\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative counseling and documentation for urogynecologic procedures outlines the general risks of surgery as well as specific risks of persistent symptoms, postoperative voiding dysfunction, de novo or worsened incontinence, and de novo or worsened sexual dysfunction.
