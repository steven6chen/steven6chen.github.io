The ulceration was described as an eczema-like eruption on the nipple and areola with a copious clear yellowish exudate. Ultimately, this would become known as Paget disease of the breast (PDB) or mammary Paget disease. While Paget believed that the nipple changes were themselves benign, it was subsequently discovered that the characteristic cells within the epidermis of the nipple (Paget cells) were in fact malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, pathology, diagnosis, and management of mammary Paget disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PDB is much less common than other presentations of breast cancer, accounting for only 1 to 3 percent of new cases of female breast cancer that are diagnosed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. PDB can occur in men; however, this is an extremely rare finding. Although cases have been described in patients ranging in age from 26 to 88, the peak incidence is between 50 and 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>Histologic (subclinical) evidence of PDB may be more frequent. In a series of 3000 consecutive mastectomy specimens, the incidence of clinical Paget disease was 0.7 percent, but histologic evidence of the disease was present in 4.9 percent of the mastectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>At least some epidemiologic data suggest that the incidence of PDB is decreasing over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a report of 1738 cases of PDB reported to the SEER database, the incidence of PDB decreased by 45 percent between 1988 and 2002, while the overall incidence of breast cancer increased over this same time period.</p><p>Although PDB is a less common presentation of breast cancer than is a palpable mass or mammographic abnormality, it is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of a chronic persistent abnormality of the nipple.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of PDB is a scaly, raw, vesicular, or ulcerated lesion that begins on the nipple and then spreads to the areola (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60575 \">picture 1</a>). Occasionally, a bloody discharge is present. PDB is usually unilateral, although bilateral cases have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nipple retraction is also a rare finding but may occur with more advanced disease.</p><p>Pain, burning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritus are commonly associated with PDB and may be present before the development of clinically apparent disease. Thus, any patient complaining of these symptoms but without an obvious lesion should be followed closely if the symptoms persist. Despite the superficial nature of the findings, the median duration of signs and symptoms prior to histologic diagnosis is between six and eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic workup of suspected PDB focuses on both establishing the diagnosis and identifying an underlying breast cancer. An underlying breast cancer (in situ or invasive) is present in 85 to 88 percent of cases, although often without an associated breast mass or mammographic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palpable breast mass is present in 50 percent of cases of PDB; the mass is often located more than 2 cm from the nipple-areolar complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 20 percent of cases, a mammographic abnormality is present without a palpable mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 12 to 15 percent of cases are not associated with a palpable mass, mammographic abnormality, or parenchymal breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 25 percent of cases, there is neither an underlying mass nor a mammographic abnormality, but an occult ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is present.</p><p/><p>Patients with either a palpable mass or a mammographic abnormality are more likely to have an underlying invasive cancer, while DCIS is found more often in the absence of a palpable mass or mammographic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed history should document the length of time the lesion has been present and any associated symptoms, including pain, nipple discharge, bleeding, burning, and pruritus. The history should also cover the patient&rsquo;s individual risk profile for breast cancer, including any risk factors for hereditary breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bilateral breast examination should be performed, focusing on associated breast abnormalities. An underlying breast malignancy is present in 85 to 88 percent of cases, and a palpable mass is present in approximately one-half.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis includes both benign etiologies (eczema, contact as well as radiation dermatitis, nipple adenoma) and malignant conditions (Bowen&rsquo;s disease [squamous carcinoma of the epidermis], basal cell carcinoma, superficial spreading malignant melanoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. </p><p>Given the differential diagnosis, a short course of topical steroids is often considered if eczema or dermatitis is suspected. However, partial healing or transient improvement in the eczematous changes may occur even in the presence of PDB. In order to avoid undue delay in definitive diagnosis, any persistent nipple abnormality should be considered an indication for biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy and histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nipple scrape cytology can accurately diagnose PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], but the diagnosis is usually established by full-thickness wedge or punch biopsy of the nipple. Wedge biopsy may contain lactiferous ducts, which may identify DCIS as the etiology of PDB.</p><p>The histologic hallmark of PDB is the presence of malignant, intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells (Paget cells) occurring singly or in small groups within the epidermis of the nipple (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81226\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81226 \">picture 2</a>). The cells are often large but may be similar in size to keratinocytes. The cytoplasm is pale to clear, and nuclei are usually high-grade with prominent nucleoli. In many instances, the Paget cells retract from the surrounding keratinocytes and appear to be within a vacuole.</p><p>Histologically, PDB can mimic malignant melanoma, particularly if the cells have incorporated melanin from the adjacent epidermis. The presence of cytoplasmic mucin vacuoles can aid in the diagnosis, as can special stains such as mucicarmine, which may highlight the vacuoles. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) may also be helpful in diagnostically difficult cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74830 \">table 1</a>). PDB can be distinguished from malignant melanoma by positive IHC for CEA (polyclonal) and negative IHC for S-100 protein; however, some cases of PDB are S-100 positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and CEA may not always be expressed. MART-1 or HMB-45 may be more useful than S-100 in confirming malignant melanoma.</p><p>If present, estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone receptor positivity is extremely helpful. Unfortunately, approximately one-half of PDB cases do not express hormone receptors, a finding that is not surprising considering the frequent association with high-grade invasive ductal carcinomas that are also likely to be hormone receptor-negative.</p><p>Paget cells are positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins, a feature that can help distinguish PDB from squamous carcinoma of the epidermis (Bowen&rsquo;s disease), which typically expresses high molecular weight cytokeratins. CK7 is probably the most useful marker, but caution must be exercised in interpreting CK7 stains in the absence of other typical histologic features of PDB. Although positive in PDB, CK7 may also be expressed in benign Toker cell hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], and some breast carcinomas may not express CK7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Toker cells in the nipple may be derived from or related to lactiferous duct epithelium, and malignant transformation of these cells may explain some cases of PDB without associated ductal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Between 84 and 91 percent of cases of PDB overexpress HER2. HER2 overexpression in PDB likely explains the worse prognosis reported for invasive breast cancer with Paget disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HER2 and predicting response to therapy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A useful IHC diagnostic panel for a nipple biopsy without underlying invasive cancer or DCIS may include CK7, CK20, CEA (monoclonal), ER, HER2, and either MART-1 or HMB-45 if melanoma is also in the biopsy differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mammography and ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral mammography is mandatory to identify an associated mass as well as exclude synchronous cancers or widespread calcifications that might preclude breast conservation therapy. Approximately one-half of cases of PDB have an associated mammographic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/15,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31</a>]. The mammographic findings in 17 women in one study included suspicious microcalcifications, a mass, architectural distortion, nipple retraction, and asymmetric thickening of the nipple-areolar complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In seven cases, the mammographic abnormalities were located distant from the nipple-areolar complex.</p><p>As noted above, while women with a negative mammogram in the setting of PDB appear to have a low likelihood of underlying invasive breast cancer (particularly in the absence of a palpable mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/16,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,32</a>]), an occult associated intraductal carcinoma may be present and quite extensive. In the above noted series, all of the 17 women with negative mammograms had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), five with extensive multicentric disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another series, mammography failed to identify 64 percent of cases of multifocal underlying breast cancer (both in situ and invasive cancer) in women with PDB and no palpable mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasound should be used to further evaluate and guide core biopsy of any palpable mass or mass-like mammographic abnormality. Whole breast ultrasound in addition to mammography has been examined in the context of Paget disease but does not appear to increase sensitivity over mammography alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive imaging tool for invasive breast cancer, particularly mammographically occult disease, although its sensitivity for DCIS is less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H100033269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Role of magnetic resonance imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are few data addressing the utility of breast MRI in women with PDB and a negative mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-43</a>]. The largest series included 34 women with PDB, 32 of whom had a histologically confirmed breast cancer (7 invasive, 25 DCIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. All patients underwent preoperative mammography, while 13 had an ipsilateral breast MRI. Among the 23 women with biopsy-proven PDB and negative mammography, eight underwent MRIs that detected otherwise occult disease in four women (three DCIS, one invasive cancer), three of whom required mastectomy because of extensive disease. However, MRI did not detect three cancers (two unifocal DCIS, one invasive cancer) in the other four patients.</p><p>Thus, MRI may disclose occult cancer in some women with PDB and no findings on mammography or physical examination, potentially allowing directed treatment of the ipsilateral breast. However, a negative preoperative study cannot reliably exclude an underlying cancer.</p><p>In addition, because MRI is highly sensitive but not highly specific, MRI may reveal abnormalities that might lead to the overuse of mastectomy rather than breast-conserving therapy. Thus, if MRI is to be performed, it should only be undertaken at an institution that has the capability of performing MRI-guided biopsies, and the patient should be counseled regarding the high false positive rate of breast MRI and the possible need for additional biopsies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy of underlying abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to nipple biopsy, any underlying masses or mammographic abnormalities must be biopsied to assist in decisions about local treatment of the breast and the need for evaluation of the axilla.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of PDB: the epidermotropic theory, which is by far the more widely accepted, and the transformation theory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidermotropic theory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the prevailing epidermotropic theory, the Paget cell arises from an underlying mammary adenocarcinoma, with the neoplastic ductal epithelial cells migrating through the ductal system of the breast into the epidermis of the nipple.</p><p>In many series, immunohistochemical staining (IHC) is concordant in Paget cells and the ductal epithelial cells but discordant in Paget cells and the epidermal keratinocytes of the surrounding nipple tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74830\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74830 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/9,44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,44-49</a>].</p><p>Similarly, expression of several molecular markers is concordant in PDB and underlying parenchymal breast tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/44,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,50</a>]. Over 80 percent of PDB have overexpression or amplification of the gene for HER2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/17,18,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,50,51</a>]. In one report, all 23 cases of PDB stained with an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody; staining was also positive in all the underlying ductal carcinomas but never in normal nipple epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is hypothesized that the spread of Paget cells to the nipple epidermis from the duct system may be mediated through a motility factor that exerts its effect via the HER2 receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61409 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Taken together, these data lend support to a common genetic alteration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> possibly a common progenitor cell for both the Paget cells and the underlying ductal carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Transformation theory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast, the transformation theory proposes that epidermal keratinocytes within the nipple transform into malignant Paget cells and that PDB in fact represents an epidermal carcinoma in situ that is independent of any underlying ductal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. George Thin proposed this theory in 1881, believing that secretions from the breast ducts damaged the epithelium, transforming normal keratinocytes to cancer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The transformation theory was bolstered by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small percentage of cases, no parenchymal cancer can be identified in association with PDB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an underlying parenchymal carcinoma is present, it is often located peripheral to the nipple, suggesting two independent neoplastic processes. As an example, in one series of 80 women with breast cancer and PDB, 29 of the underlying breast tumors were located more than 2 cm from the areolar margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desmosomal attachments have been identified between Paget cells and adjacent epidermal keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. These authors describe a &ldquo;pre-Paget cell&rdquo; with an appearance intermediate between that of a keratinocyte and a Paget cell, suggesting that epidermal cells can acquire the characteristics of ductal cells as they undergo malignant transformation. Others suggest the presence of a unique precursor, the Toker cell, to explain cases of PDB with no contiguous ductal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/28,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,54</a>].</p><p/><p>The transformation theory has fallen out of favor, in part because if enough tissue sections are studied, involvement of the large (lactiferous) ducts immediately beneath the nipple can usually be demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of Paget disease of the breast does not change the stage of an underlying breast cancer. If an associated invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ is not identified, Paget disease is classified as Tis (Paget) disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important aspect of presentation that influences the treatment decision is the presence or absence of an ipsilateral palpable breast mass or mammographic abnormality. The prognosis of PDB is based upon the underlying breast cancer, and treatment should be guided by the stage of the tumor and other prognostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> predictive factors.</p><p>Simple mastectomy has been the historic standard treatment for PDB. However, the widespread use of breast-conserving treatment (BCT) for invasive and in-situ breast carcinoma has led to its use for PDB. In contrast to invasive breast cancer, treatment recommendations are limited by the lack of prospective, randomized trials comparing mastectomy to BCT or comparing various BCT options in patients with PDB. Most reported series are small, and patient selection, treatment techniques, and median follow-up vary from study to study.

Many patients will require a mastectomy. However, if nipple-areolar resection and wide local excision of the palpable mass or area of mammographic abnormality can be performed with an acceptable cosmetic result and negative margins, breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy (RT) is an appropriate local treatment option. If the breasts are large, resection of the palpable mass and nipple-areolar complex with nipple reconstruction and contralateral breast reduction can be combined with definitive breast RT to achieve an adequate oncologic outcome with acceptable breast contour and symmetry.</p><p>Women with multicentric cancer or diffuse calcifications should be treated by mastectomy with axillary evaluation, for example by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Many women with PDB and a palpable mass are not amenable to BCT because of the distance between the primary tumor and the nipple-areolar complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If resection of both the nipple-areolar complex and the palpable mass with a negative margin would result in an unacceptable cosmetic result, women may elect simple mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction.

Of the 22 patients undergoing complete nipple-areolar resection followed by whole breast RT with a boost (total dose 61.5 Gy), three (14 percent) developed a local recurrence. In contrast, two of six women (33 percent) treated with the same dose of RT but only a partial nipple-areolar resection recurred locally, one with distant metastases. All four women with an isolated local recurrence were successfully salvaged with mastectomy and remained disease-free at the time of last follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) conducted a prospective study of BCT for PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This study excluded women with invasive cancer. Of the 61 women enrolled in the study with histologically proven PDB, 97 percent had no associated palpable mass, and 84 percent had a normal mammogram. Associated DCIS was present in 93 percent, and the remainder had no underlying parenchymal carcinoma. Treatment consisted of complete nipple-areolar resection followed by whole breast RT (median dose 50 Gy). There were four local recurrences (6.5 percent), with a median follow-up of 6.4 years. Three recurrences were invasive, and one was DCIS; one patient with an invasive recurrence subsequently died of metastatic disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several subsequent retrospective studies comparing BCT with mastectomy showed that the type of surgery made no difference in outcomes (eg, survival, recurrence) of patients with PDB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/13,62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,62-65</a>].

A variety of techniques can be used to reconstruct the nipple-areolar complex, and cosmesis has been assessed as good to excellent in the majority of patients so treated.

Given the high incidence of DCIS alone in patients with PDB and no evidence of an underlying breast mass, SLNB is recommended only if invasive disease is identified or mastectomy is planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, some consider the likelihood of invasive disease high enough to recommend a SLN biopsy, regardless of the type of surgery that is planned. In a series of 19 patients with PDB only, an invasive component was found in 27 percent and positive SLNs in 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paget-disease-of-the-breast/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. As most patients prefer to avoid a procedure that is not necessary, SLNB is recommended only if indicated; the potential need for a second operation for SLNB if an invasive cancer is identified should be discussed.

Thus, neither of these approaches can be considered a standard treatment option for most patients with PDB in the absence of an underlying mass.</p><p>Few areas in breast cancer treatment are as contentious as the obligate need for RT as a component of BCT in women with DCIS. Proponents of RT for all women with DCIS argue that local recurrence rates are substantially higher when RT is withheld and that one-half of all local recurrences are invasive. Others contend that RT represents overly aggressive therapy for many women with DCIS and that by weighing factors of prognostic importance (ie, grade, size, age, and distance to margins), a sizable subset can be identified who have excellent recurrence-free survival with excision alone.

The pathologic hallmark and defining feature is the presence of malignant, intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells (Paget cells) within the epidermis of the nipple. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDB is associated with an underlying breast cancer (in situ [DCIS] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive) in 85 to 88 percent of cases, often without an associated breast mass or mammographic abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PDB can usually be established by punch or full-thickness wedge biopsy of the nipple. Biopsy of any underlying mass or mammographic abnormality is required to assist in decisions about local treatment of the breast and the need for evaluation of the axilla. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic workup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic workup of all patients with PDB should include careful physical examination of both breasts and mammography. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered in a patient with a negative physical examination and mammogram. All mammographically occult lesions that are identified by MRI do not represent cancer, and confirmatory biopsy is needed. Thus, MRI should only be obtained at institutions with the capability of performing MRI-guided biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic workup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have a palpable mass in association with PDB are more likely to harbor invasive breast cancer than are those with no palpable mass, and they are also more likely to have involved axillary lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'PDB with a palpable mass or abnormal imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with PDB and no palpable underlying mass or radiographic abnormality have a low likelihood of harboring invasive breast cancer; the majority have underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'PDB with no palpable mass or imaging abnormality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an invasive breast cancer is identified, it should be treated like any other invasive breast cancer, with consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation and treatment of the axilla in PDB are the same as for any breast cancer and depend on the underlying cancer identified and the planned surgical procedure (breast-conserving surgery or total mastectomy). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of the axilla'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy (RT) are acceptable treatment options. Breast-conserving surgery and RT should only be performed when a nipple-areolar resection and wide local excision of the underlying cancer can be performed with an acceptable cosmetic result and negative margins.
