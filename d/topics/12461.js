It is caused by a deficiency of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), the second enzyme of the metabolic pathway of the three branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. It is characterized by psychomotor delay, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor of the urine.</p><p>MSUD is reviewed here. A general discussion of amino acid disorders is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-classification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Classification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MSUD occurs in approximately 1 in 86,800 to 185,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It occurs more frequently in populations with an increased frequency of consanguinity, such as the Mennonites in Pennsylvania, where the incidence is as high as 1 in 200 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are essential amino acids with hydrophobic side chains and are important precursors for gluconeogenesis, energy production, and synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the first step of branched-chain metabolism, branched-chain amino acids are converted by cytosolic and mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferases (BCATs) to their respective alpha-ketoacids. The alpha-ketoacids are subsequently decarboxylated by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) to yield isovaleryl-coenzyme A (CoA), alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA, and isobutyrl-CoA, respectively, which eventually result in acetyl-CoA, acetoacetate, and succinyl-CoA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F106831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106831 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Deficiency of one of the two BCAT enzymes may lead to variable increases of branched-chain amino acids, although only individual cases have been reported to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The BCKDC is situated on the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of three catalytic components (E1, E2, and E3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The E1 component catalyzes decarboxylation of the three alpha ketoacids and is mediated by thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). E1 is comprised of two distinct subunits, E1-alpha and E1-beta, that form an alpha-2-beta-2 heterotetramer. A lipoic acid moiety in the E2 or acyltransferase component helps transfer the branched-chain acyl group from E1 to CoA. The E3 or dehydrogenase component is a flavoprotein requiring lipoamide, flavin, and flavin adenine <span class=\"nowrap\">dinucleotide/nicotinamide</span> adenine dinucleotide <span class=\"nowrap\">(FAD/NAD)</span> as cofactors. It resets the lipoyl moiety to the active oxidized form. This component is also associated with the alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.</p><p>The BCKDC also is associated with two regulatory enzymes, BCKDC phosphatase and BCKDC kinase. These control the activity of the BCKDC by reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Decreased activity of BCKDC in MSUD results in elevation of plasma concentrations of the branched-chain amino acids and corresponding keto acids. A metabolite of isoleucine causes the urine to smell like maple syrup. The neurotoxicity of MSUD is thought to be caused primarily by the accumulation of leucine and metabolites in the central nervous system, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. A study performed in rats demonstrated that administration of branched-chain amino acids plus lipopolysaccharides to mimic infection led to an increased breakdown of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This preliminary study suggests that breakdown of the BBB may play an important role during episodes of metabolic decompensation in patients with MSUD when exposed to infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Older studies have shown that elevated leucine concentrations may impair regulation of cell volume, resulting in decreased serum sodium concentration and increased intracellular water, leading to cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. A decrease in blood osmolarity can precipitate fatal brain herniation in infants and children with MSUD. Another mechanism of neurotoxicity may be increased production of glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) caused by the rapid transport of leucine across the BBB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The genes encoding branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) components E1-alpha, E1-beta, E2, and E3 have been mapped to human chromosomes 19q13.1-q13.2 (<em>BCKDHA</em>), 6p22-p21 (<em>BCKDHB</em>), 1p31 (<em>DBT</em>), and 7q31-q32 (<em>DLD</em>), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The sequences of all genes are fully characterized, including regulatory elements. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in any of these genes can cause any of the forms of MSUD outlined below. No strict genotype-phenotype correlation exists in patients with MSUD. Founder mutations are identified in populations with a particularly high prevalence of MSUD (eg, Mennonites, Amish) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A patient with a mild form of MSUD due to homozygous mutations in the <em>PPM1K</em> gene encoding the BCKDC phosphatase has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mutations in the gene encoding the BCKDC kinase have not been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are five distinct clinical phenotypes of MSUD: classic, intermittent, intermediate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thiamine</a> responsive, and E3 deficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In most cases, these do not correlate with specific mutations. However, they can be distinguished based upon age of onset, severity of clinical symptoms, and response to thiamine treatment.</p><p>Classic MSUD and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency (DLDD, E3-deficient MSUD) typically present in newborns. The intermediate, intermittent, and thiamine-responsive forms may present at any time during infancy or childhood, usually during episodes of stress. Intermediate MSUD presents rarely in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>All affected patients have elevated plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), including alloisoleucine and urine levels of branched-chain ketoacids, lactate, and pyruvate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic MSUD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic MSUD is the most common form of the disorder. It results from mutations in the genes for E1-alpha, E1-beta, and E2, leading to less than 3 percent residual enzyme activity. Newborns typically develop ketonuria within 48 hours of birth and present with irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By four days of age, neurologic abnormalities include alternating lethargy and irritability, dystonia, apnea, seizures, and signs of cerebral edema. Initial symptoms may not develop until the infant is four to seven days of age, depending upon the amount of protein in the feeding regimen. Breastfeeding may delay onset of symptoms to the second week.</p><p>Episodes of metabolic intoxication may occur in affected older infants or children who usually are controlled by nutritional management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These episodes often are caused by increased catabolism of endogenous protein that may be induced by intercurrent illness or by exercise, injury, surgery, or fasting. Clinical manifestations include epigastric pain, vomiting, anorexia, and muscle fatigue. Pancreatitis is an occasional finding. Neurologic signs may include hyperactivity, sleep disturbance, stupor, decreased cognitive function, dystonia, and ataxia. A clinical picture similar to Wernicke encephalopathy has been reported in cases of acute decompensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Death may occur from cerebral edema and herniation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermediate MSUD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermediate MSUD is a rare disorder that is associated with mutations in the E1-alpha component of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Residual BCKDC activity typically is 3 to 30 percent of normal. Patients may become symptomatic at any age. Presentation is later in those with greater enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>].</p><p>The clinical signs are characterized by acute neurologic symptoms (irritability, dystonia) and developmental delay of variable extent. Seizures may occur in some patients. Episodes of acute metabolic decompensation are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent MSUD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent MSUD is the second most common type of MSUD. Affected patients have normal growth and development. They typically present with ketoacidosis during episodes of catabolic stress, including intercurrent illnesses such as otitis media, or increased protein intake. Signs of neurotoxicity develop during these episodes, including ataxia, lethargy, seizures, and coma. Death may occur without appropriate recognition and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Thiamine-responsive MSUD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thiamine-responsive MSUD is a rare phenotype that is associated with mutations in the E2 component of BCKDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. Clinical presentation is similar to the intermediate form. In general, affected patients do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thiamine</a> supplementation alone, despite the term used for this phenotype, and dietary restriction of branched-chain amino acids is required to achieve metabolic control. Only one reported case has shown true thiamine responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">E3-deficient MSUD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the gene encoding the E3 component of BCKDC result in a very rare form of MSUD, with only a few reported patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Affected patients have combined deficiencies of BCKDC and the pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. Clinical features are similar to intermediate MSUD. However, E3-deficient patients typically present in the newborn period and also have lactic acidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns, infants, and children who present with encephalopathy and ketoacidosis sporadically, intermittently, during episodes of intercurrent illness, or following prolonged fasting or trauma should be tested for MSUD, even in the context of negative newborn screening results. The most important diagnostic test for MSUD is the measurement of plasma amino acid concentrations to evaluate for elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and alloisoleucine (a metabolite of leucine). However, an increase in alloisoleucine levels may not appear until six days of age, even when leucine levels are elevated. Urine organic acid analysis to detect branched-chain hydroacids and branched-chain keto acids can be used to corroborate the diagnosis. The identification of elevated alloisoleucine in plasma is sufficient to reach a diagnosis of MSUD; urine studies are not needed in this case.</p><p>Detection of alloisoleucine is also helpful to differentiate MSUD from ketotic hypoglycemia. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations may be transiently elevated in ketotic hypoglycemia or in the postabsorptive state, but alloisoleucine will not be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mutation analysis is an option in patients with MSUD to confirm the diagnosis, predict <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thiamine</a> responsiveness, and aid in prenatal diagnosis if future pregnancies are anticipated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141543843\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis can be performed by measuring branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or choriovillus cells or by mutation analysis if the specific gene defect is known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2204497\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic MSUD in newborn infants is readily detected only by screening using tandem mass spectrometry. Recall rates may be reduced by use of a second-tier method to analyze alloisoleucine in dry blood spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, affected newborns may be symptomatic before the results are available. Newborn screening may not detect milder or variant forms of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Mutational analysis can be performed in a newborn with a family history of MSUD if the specific gene defects are known. If pathogenic variants are not known, high-risk newborns can be evaluated with DNA testing for <em>BCKDHA, BCKDHB, </em>and<em> DBT</em> gene mutations. Plasma should be obtained between 18 to 24 hours of life in these high-risk newborns for amino acid analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1879811018\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urea cycle defects, glycine encephalopathy, organic acidopathies (methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, and others); 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) lyase deficiency; and beta-ketothiolase deficiency can present with neonatal encephalopathy. Basic laboratory testing that is performed in patients with a suspected inborn error of metabolism will distinguish between most of the disorders in the differential diagnosis. These tests include blood gas analysis, electrolytes (anion gap), lactic acid, ammonia, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and urine ketone analysis. Specialized metabolic testing including urine organic acid and acylglycine, plasma amino acid, and acylcarnitine analysis is needed to finalize the diagnosis. The diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Identifying the specific disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of MSUD has two primary aspects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary therapy to promote normal growth and development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive treatment of episodes of acute metabolic decompensation</p><p/><p>An experienced metabolic disease specialist and a dietician should be involved in the management of MSUD patients.</p><p>Liver transplantation offers an additional therapeutic avenue for difficult-to-treat patients with MSUD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of dietary therapy are to reduce toxic metabolites; achieve plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids, especially leucine, that are within the target range; support normal growth; and preserve intellectual function and development. This is accomplished by restricting intake of branched-chain amino acids using commercially available formulas and medical food, providing sufficient calories and fluids to maintain metabolic homeostasis, and providing valine and isoleucine supplementation to promote anabolism. Dietary restriction is maintained throughout life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Monitoring consists of measurement of plasma amino acid concentrations every one to two weeks for the first 6 to 12 months of age. The intake of leucine, valine, and isoleucine can be adjusted for the individual patient according to these measurements. Monitoring can be performed less frequently with increasing age, based upon individual circumstances such as metabolic stability and compliance. We suggest weekly testing in patients &lt;3 months of age, every other week to monthly testing from 3 to 12 months of age, and then monthly testing thereafter. For patients presenting after infancy, we suggest monthly levels until stabilized and testing every three to six months thereafter.</p><p>Plasma leucine concentrations should be maintained between 75 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> in children &lt;5 years of age and between 75 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> for patients &gt;5 years of age to achieve favorable intellectual outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Plasma valine and isoleucine concentrations should be maintained between 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In addition to dietary therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thiamine</a> (50 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> should be given for four weeks to all patients with MSUD, except for those who are homozygous for the 1312T&gt;A mutation or who carry mutations expected to result in less than 3 percent residual enzyme activity. Plasma branched-chain amino acids and tolerance for dietary branched-chain amino acids should be monitored. Thiamine supplementation should be continued in confirmed thiamine-responsive patients in addition to dietary therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Thiamine-responsive MSUD'</a> above.)</p><p>Supplementation with sodium chloride may be necessary to help maintain serum sodium concentration in the normal range and to reduce the risk for cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. During acute admissions, plasma sodium concentrations are followed at least every 12 to 24 hours or more frequently if clinically indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic decompensation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of metabolic decompensation must be treated aggressively. Plasma and tissue concentrations of leucine should be lowered rapidly by inhibition of protein catabolism and enhancement of protein synthesis through aggressive therapy including glucose infusions with or without the addition of insulin (add if glucose levels are &gt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and supplementation with precursor free amino acid mixture. Protein intake is typically discontinued for 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/4,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At least 1.25 times the weight or body surface-adjusted estimated energy requirement needs to be provided. The total nutritional goal can be met by combined enteral and parenteral administration. Isoleucine and valine supplementation (20 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> each) should be provided to maintain plasma concentrations of 400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> during the acute decompensation period. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is indicated during presumed episodes of metabolic decompensation because forced diuresis may assist in detoxification. Hypotonic fluid is generally not used to avoid osmolarity fluctuation, and sodium concentration should be maintained within physiologic concentrations of 138 to 145 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>.</p><p>Hyponatremic cerebral edema should be treated with hypertonic saline, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>. In rare circumstances, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be needed to remove branched-chain amino acids and keto-acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2204626\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) enzyme activity is expressed in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, liver transplantation has been used to treat classic MSUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-38</a>], although dietary therapy is considered the more appropriate option in most patients because of the higher risks and potential long-term complications of liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maple-syrup-urine-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Indications include poor metabolic control and poor quality of life as indicated by significant psychomotor disabilities and more frequent acute metabolic decompensations and related hospitalizations.</p><p>After transplantation, BCKDC activity is similar to mild types of MSUD, and patients no longer require dietary restriction.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Classic MSUD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intermediate MSUD have residual BCKDC activity and may become symptomatic at any age. Manifestations include neurologic impairment and developmental delay of variable extent. Seizures may occur in some patients. Episodes of acute metabolic decompensation are rare. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate MSUD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intermittent MSUD typically present with ketoacidosis during episodes of catabolic stress. Death may occur without appropriate recognition and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent MSUD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of thiamine-responsive MSUD and E3-deficiency MSUD is similar to the intermediate form, except that onset of E3-deficient MSUD is in the newborn period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MSUD have elevated plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and elevated urine levels of branched-chain ketoacids, lactate, and pyruvate. Detection of alloisoleucine (a metabolite of leucine) and 2-oxo-3-methylvaleric acid with high-pressure liquid chromatography is also diagnostic for MSUD. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry readily detects classic MSUD. However, affected newborns may develop symptoms before the results are available. Newborn screening may not detect milder forms of the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal diagnosis can be performed in an experienced laboratory by measuring enzyme activity in cultured amniocytes or choriovillus cells or by molecular testing. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutation analysis is an option in patients with MSUD to confirm the diagnosis, predict disease severity, predict <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thiamine</a> responsiveness, and aid in prenatal diagnosis if future pregnancies are anticipated. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of MSUD has two primary aspects: dietary therapy to promote normal growth and development and aggressive treatment of episodes of acute metabolic decompensation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of dietary therapy is to achieve normal plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Dietary restriction is maintained throughout life. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dietary therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of metabolic decompensation must be treated aggressively. Plasma and tissue concentrations of leucine should be lowered rapidly by inhibition of protein catabolism and enhancement of protein synthesis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic decompensation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal outcome is possible in MSUD. The best outcomes occur in patients who begin therapy before they become symptomatic or are treated rapidly after symptoms develop. Cognitive outcome appears to be related to plasma leucine concentration. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Naylor EW.
