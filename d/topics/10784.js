Blood pressure medicines can help prevent heart disease and slow down kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines &ndash; These will depend on the kind of kidney disease you have, and if you have other medical problems.</p><p/><p>Normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water. In people with chronic kidney disease, the kidneys stop working as well as they should. They also cannot filter medicines as well as they normally would. Because of this, it's important to take your medicines exactly as they have been prescribed for you. Using pill boxes and reminders can help (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59726 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If your medicines cause unpleasant side effects or you can't afford them, talk to your doctor or nurse. There are often ways to deal with these problems.</p><p>Some medicines can build up or cause problems for people with kidney disease. These include &quot;NSAIDs,&quot; such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). Before you take any new medicines, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements, ask your doctor and pharmacist how they can affect your kidneys.</p><p>Keep a list of the names and doses of all the medicines you take and bring it with you each time you visit any doctor or pharmacy. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOH1A9qYx6y2gNfguCapw4LVrAwUchd4jya7gdQvCezTm9dGzWRw5s0j5Z4wLQI7FQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=86002\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a>.</p><p>Listed below are the medicines used to treat chronic kidney disease. They are also listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86675\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86675 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88458279\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines that treat high blood pressure and slow kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need more than 1 kind of blood pressure medicine to help your kidneys:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ACE inhibitors and ARBs</strong> &ndash; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (called &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot;) and angiotensin receptor blockers (called &quot;ARBs&quot;) work in similar ways. These medicines lower the blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels. They also lower the pressure inside the kidneys so that the kidneys can filter better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of ACE inhibitors include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">enalapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">captopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lisinopril</a>. Examples of ARBs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">candesartan</a> (brand name: Atacand) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">valsartan</a> (brand name: Diovan).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diuretics (water pills)</strong> &ndash; Diuretics lower blood pressure by helping the body get rid of extra salt and fluid. They make people urinate a lot, especially at first. If this makes it difficult for you to take these medicines, work with your doctor or nurse to find a good time of the day to take them. Diuretics work better if you limit the amount of salt (sodium) you eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An example of a commonly used diuretic is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">furosemide</a> (brand name: Lasix).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other blood pressure medicines</strong> &ndash; Depending on your blood pressure and the type of kidney disease you have, your doctor might prescribe other types of blood pressure medicines, such as calcium channel blockers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88458296\"><span class=\"h1\">Other medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might prescribe other medicines, depending on the kinds of problems caused by your kidney disease. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Phosphate</strong> <strong>binders</strong> &mdash; Phosphate is a mineral found in many foods. Having chronic kidney disease can increase the amount of phosphate in the body. This can be harmful. To lower the amount of phosphate in your body, doctors can prescribe medicines called &quot;phosphate binders.&quot; To work, these medicines <strong>must be taken with meals and snacks</strong>. Your doctor might also recommend you eat foods that have low amounts of phosphate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of phosphate binders include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calcium carbonate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-acetate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calcium acetate</a> (sample brand name: PhosLo), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sevelamer</a> (sample brand name: Renagel), and lanthanum (brand name: Fosrenol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vitamin D</strong> &mdash; Having chronic kidney disease can lead to having low levels of calcium in the blood. This can cause bone problems. To help prevent bone problems, doctors sometimes prescribe vitamin D. An example of a vitamin D medicine is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calcitriol</a> (brand name: Rocaltrol).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines to treat anemia</strong> &mdash; Anemia is the medical term for when a person has too few red blood cells. This condition can make you feel weak or tired. It is common in people with chronic kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Doctors can treat anemia by giving you extra iron. They can also use medicines called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (called &quot;ESAs&quot;). These include erythropoietin (brand names: Epogen, Procrit) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darbepoetin-alfa-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">darbepoetin alfa</a> (brand name: Aranesp).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> &mdash; When you have chronic kidney disease, the levels of acids in your body can become abnormal. This can lead to problems like weak bones and muscles. Your doctor might prescribe a sodium bicarbonate pill to help with this problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">People who take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sodium bicarbonate</a> need to avoid eating too much salt. That's because sodium bicarbonate also has salt in it. Having too much salt in your body raises your blood pressure and can make your kidney disease worse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88458371\"><span class=\"h1\">Medicines for your other medical conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines that your doctor prescribes for high blood sugar (diabetes) or high cholesterol are also important in treating your kidney disease.</p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp, available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88458386\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-problems-caused-by-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone problems caused by kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia of chronic disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-in-the-urine-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
