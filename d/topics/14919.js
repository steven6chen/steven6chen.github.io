An MPGN pattern of injury may result from multiple causes including infection, autoimmune diseases, monoclonal gammopathies, and complement dysregulation. In addition, an MPGN pattern of injury may occur in the absence of an obvious cause. This is referred to as idiopathic MPGN.</p><p>Patients with MPGN may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require renal replacement therapy, including dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transplantation. Among patients who undergo transplantation, idiopathic MPGN and MPGN resulting from complement dysregulation commonly recur. Patients with MPGN that is secondary to infection, autoimmune disorders, and monoclonal gammopathies are generally not eligible for transplantation, unless the underlying cause is addressed.</p><p>This topic reviews recurrent idiopathic MPGN in the transplanted kidney. The recurrence in the transplanted kidney of MPGN resulting from complement dysregulation is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrence-of-c3-glomerulopathies-after-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrence of C3 glomerulopathies after transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presentation, classification, causes, and treatment of MPGN in the native kidney are discussed elsewhere.

Immune complex-mediated MPGN is characterized by both immunoglobulin and complement protein deposition in the kidney, as identified by immunofluorescence microscopy. C3 glomerulopathy is characterized by complement deposition in the absence of immunoglobulin deposition.</p><p>A previously used system, which was based upon ultrastructural features observed by electron microscopy (EM), classifies MPGN into subtypes I, II, and III. MPGN type I generally refers to immune complex-mediated MPGN, though not necessarily idiopathic MPGN. Most studies of recurrent MPGN in the transplanted kidney used the EM-based classification. In order to discuss these studies, where possible, we include the older classification system as well as the more current system.</p><p>The classification and characteristic histologic features of subtypes are described in depth elsewhere.

Occasionally, a cause is not identified, resulting in the diagnosis of idiopathic MPGN. Idiopathic MPGN is a diagnosis of exclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-idiopathic-immune-complex-mediated-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis-mpgn-after-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>C3 glomerulopathy results from dysregulation and persistent activation of the alternative complement pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-idiopathic-immune-complex-mediated-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis-mpgn-after-transplantation/abstract/1,2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193665157\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall reported rate of recurrent idiopathic MPGN is between 19 and 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-idiopathic-immune-complex-mediated-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis-mpgn-after-transplantation/abstract/17-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-27</a>].

This is because the diagnosis of MPGN is made by renal biopsy (see <a href=\"#H357474550\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> below), and some of the histologic changes observed in MPGN are similar to those seen in chronic transplant rejection (transplant glomerulopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-idiopathic-immune-complex-mediated-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis-mpgn-after-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As a result, some patients diagnosed as having recurrent MPGN may actually have transplant glomerulopathy.

The diagnosis is made by biopsy. A biopsy with analysis of tissue by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy (EM) should be performed in all transplant recipients who have idiopathic MPGN as a cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the native kidney and who present with unexplained, new or worsening proteinuria, hematuria, or a decline in eGFR.

Immune complex-mediated MPGN that occurs without a known cause is called idiopathic MPGN. C3 glomerulopathy results from complement dysregulation. Idiopathic MPGN and C3 glomerulopathy recur after renal transplantation.

The diagnosis is made by renal biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H357474550\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no proven treatment for recurrent idiopathic MPGN. (See <a href=\"#H11152926\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our approach to treatment is based upon the severity of presentation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a stable eGFR and proteinuria that is less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> we suggest treating with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based upon observed benefit in nontransplant recipients with proteinuric kidney disease. We target a blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg. As for most transplant recipients, we also treat with a statin, primarily for cardiovascular benefit. (See <a href=\"#H11152926\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In such patients, we do not change the antirejection immunosuppressive regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with proteinuria &ge;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and eGFR that is stable or declining slowly, we suggest increasing the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We generally increase the prednisone dose to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose of 60 to 80 mg daily) for 16 weeks, followed by a taper to the previous antirejection dose (ie, typically 5 mg daily) over several weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For patients who do not respond to the increased steroid dose with a decline in protein excretion and stabilization of GFR, we suggest increasing the dose of the antimetabolite (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If the patient is on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, we increase the dose, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. If the patient is on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, we increase, as tolerated, to a maximum dose of 1500 mg twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H11152926\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have rapidly declining eGFR, we suggest plasmapheresis with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and pulse intravenous steroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We provide daily or alternate-day plasmapheresis with albumin replacement fluid. Intravenous cyclophosphamide may be given as a single dose of 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> with pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (500 to 1000 mg daily for three days), followed by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> with maximum of 60 to 80 mg per day). For patients who are treated with cyclophosphamide, the antimetabolite for antirejection should be held.
