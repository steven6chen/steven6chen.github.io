The word &quot;cognitive&quot; has to do with memory and thinking. The word &quot;impairment&quot; means having trouble doing something.</p><p>It is normal for adults to have slight memory problems as they get older. But the problems in MCI are more significant than those of normal aging.</p><p>Many people with MCI later develop a condition called &quot;dementia.&quot; Dementia is the general term for a group of brain disorders that cause problems with memory and thinking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51927\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51927 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Dementia is a more serious problem than MCI. People with MCI usually don't have many problems doing their daily tasks and activities. But people with dementia might not be able to do their daily tasks or activities correctly or at all.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13608232\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of MCI?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Memory problems are the most common symptom of MCI. Some people have other types of thinking problems. They might have trouble concentrating, reasoning, or remembering the correct word to use.</p><p>People with MCI might also feel sad, worried, or angry; act in a threatening way; or believe things that aren't true.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13608247\"><span class=\"h1\">How can my doctor or nurse tell if I have MCI?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To tell if you have MCI, your doctor or nurse will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk with you and your family &ndash; He or she will ask about your symptoms, behavior, and daily activities, and how these have changed over time. He or she will also ask about your medical conditions and medicines. That's because some medical conditions and medicines can also cause memory problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an exam</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask questions to check your memory and thinking</p><p/><p>Your doctor will probably do tests to check that another medical condition isn't causing your symptoms. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT or MRI scan of your brain &ndash; These are imaging tests that can create pictures of your brain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More detailed tests to check your memory, language, and thinking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13608262\"><span class=\"h1\">How is MCI treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sadly, there really aren't helpful treatments for MCI. As of now, no medicines can prevent MCI from turning into dementia.</p><p>If you have a lot of memory problems, your doctor might prescribe a medicine used to treat a type of dementia called Alzheimer disease. These medicines can sometimes help improve symptoms. Plus, your doctor might suggest that you avoid certain medicines, which can impair thinking.</p><p>Your doctor will also talk with you about ways to keep your brain as healthy as possible. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting regular exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an active social life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping your brain busy and active</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making sure your blood pressure is not too high</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13608277\"><span class=\"h1\">Do people with MCI always get dementia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Although many people with MCI get dementia later on, some do not.</p><p>There is no way to know which people with MCI will get dementia. That's why it's important to have regular follow-ups with your doctor. He or she can follow your symptoms to see if they change or get worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13608292\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-memory-and-thinking-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Evaluating memory and thinking problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
