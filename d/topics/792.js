In one report, the incidence of a twofold or greater increase in serum creatinine was 15 percent in patients taking no or one concurrent nephrotoxic drug and 41 percent in those taking two or more concurrent nephrotoxic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease at baseline and the severity of the underlying illness also increase the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].

In the lowest risk group (12 percent of patients), the risk of nephrotoxicity was 4 percent, while in the highest risk group (10 percent of patients), the risk of acute kidney injury was 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In most cases, the serum creatinine increases by no more than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> above baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,4,6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,9</a>]. More severe kidney injury due to amphotericin B alone is uncommon, but can occur with diuretic-induced volume depletion or the concurrent administration of another nephrotoxin.</p><p>Issues related to prevention of amphotericin B nephrotoxicity, including the use of lipid-based formulations, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lipid-based formulations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of amphotericin-induced nephrotoxicity is incompletely understood. It has been proposed that both tubular injury and renal vasoconstriction play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Amphotericin B inserts into cell membranes, resulting in the creation of pores that increase membrane permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Proximal tubular cells and medullary interstitial cells respond with programmed cell death when treated with therapeutic doses of amphotericin B. In animal models, the number of apoptotic tubular cells correlates with the degree of hypokalemia and loss of renal concentrating ability; administration of insulin-like growth factor-1, an antiapoptotic agent, prevents hypokalemia and preserves concentrating ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition to this direct effect, in vitro studies suggest that approximately one-half of the tubular toxicity of amphotericin B may be mediated by deoxycholate, a detergent used as a solubilizing agent for amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The reduction in GFR associated with amphotericin B-induced tubular toxicity may be mediated in part by the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. Normally, when sodium chloride (NaCl) delivery to the distal tubule increases, a greater quantity of NaCl enters the macula densa cells located in the early portion of the distal tubule. This results in a feedback loop (TGF), which triggers afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a fall in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. Under most circumstances, this TGF response is physiologically appropriate: high rates of NaCl delivery out of the proximal tubule are restored to near normal levels by the appropriate reduction in GFR, and this prevents excessive NaCl losses in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, amphotericin B nephrotoxicity increases the permeability of the macula densa cells. This may inappropriately activate the TGF system and lead to excessive afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a fall in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, the renal vasoconstriction and fall in GFR may reflect a direct action of amphotericin B on blood vessels, rather than TGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In experimental animals, administration of a calcium channel blocker prevents amphotericin-induced vasoconstriction and the resultant decline in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of nephrotoxicity can be reduced by using lower doses of amphotericin and by avoiding concurrent therapy with other nephrotoxins, such as an aminoglycoside or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Two other preventive measures are salt loading and the use of lipid formulations of amphotericin B. In addition, for some fungal infections, non-amphotericin B agents are now available.</p><p>N-acetylcysteine has been shown to protect against amphotericin-induced nephrotoxicity in animal models, preserving GFR and reducing apoptosis of renal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Evidence for a protective role in humans, however, has been inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Salt loading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proposed importance of TGF in amphotericin B nephrotoxicity has led to the use of salt loading since volume expansion has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of the TGF system. Studies in both humans and animals have shown that saline administration can protect against or ameliorate the amphotericin B-induced decline in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,2,9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9,19</a>] but <strong>not</strong> the signs of tubular dysfunction described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The beneficial effect of salt loading was best shown in a controlled study of patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis who received a 10-week course of amphotericin B (average dose 50 mg per day, given three times per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The serum creatinine concentration was stable with salt loading (1 liter of isotonic saline over the 60 minutes prior to amphotericin B administration) but rose from 0.6 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (53 to 88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in patients given only water. The minor degree of renal insufficiency in the relatively healthy control group probably reflects in part the absence of potentiating factors, such as volume depletion or concurrent aminoglycoside therapy.</p><p>However, this benefit of salt loading does not prove that TGF, rather than vasoconstriction, is the major mechanism underlying the reduced GFR. Increases in the secretion of vasoconstrictors (angiotensin II and norepinephrine) and decreases in the secretion of the vasodilator atrial natriuretic peptide might modulate the constrictive effect of amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; volume expansion could prevent these hormonal changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipid-based formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and human studies (including both observational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>] and randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]) suggest that the incidence and severity of nephrotoxicity can be minimized, though not eliminated, by administering amphotericin B in a lipid-based formulation. Several lipid-based amphotericin B products exist. Lipid complex (Abelcet) and liposomal (AmBisome) are available in the USA. Colloidal dispersion (Amphocil) is not currently widely available.</p><p>The best comparative data are reported in a meta-analysis of randomized trials which compared conventional amphotericin B with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> (five trials, 1233 patients) and lipid emulsion amphotericin B (nine trials, 459 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Compared with conventional amphotericin B, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly reduced with the use of liposomal amphotericin B (14.5 versus 32.5 percent) or lipid emulsion amphotericin B (12.2 versus 30.6 percent).</p><p>The reduced risk of nephrotoxicity found in this meta-analysis is consistent with two large retrospective series of 3514 patients treated with lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A doubling of the serum creatinine concentration occurred in 13 percent of patients, and 3 percent required dialysis.</p><p>The reason why lipid-based formulations are associated with less acute kidney injury is incompletely understood. However, two possibilities have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The liposomal preparation does not contain deoxycholate, which (as noted above) has direct tubular toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The liposomes may be preferentially distributed to the reticuloendothelial system, where amphotericin B can be transferred directly to trapped fungi with less delivery to other cholesterol-containing cells, such as those in the kidney.</p><p/><p>Among the lipid preparations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> may be less nephrotoxic than the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>As with conventional amphotericin B, the risk of nephrotoxicity with lipid-based formulations is higher among patients concurrently treated with other nephrotoxic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]. In one randomized trial, for example, the incidence of nephrotoxicity, defined as a twofold or greater increase in serum creatinine, was significantly lower in patients who were given the liposomal preparation (19 versus 34 percent). However, the incidence of nephrotoxicity varied according to whether patients were taking additional nephrotoxic drugs (an aminoglycoside, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>). In those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a>, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was 6 percent if no or one concurrent nephrotoxic drug was administered and 22 percent if two or more concurrent nephrotoxic drugs were used. Similarly, in a study of 97 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with liposomal amphotericin B, the incidence of liposomal amphotericin-induced nephrotoxicity during the first 10 days of therapy was 7 percent overall but only 3 percent among those who were not receiving cyclosporine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Lipid-based formulations have largely supplanted the use of conventional amphotericin B in countries with adequate resources. However, the conventional formulation is still widely used for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, as recommended the Infectious Disease Society of America and the World Health Organization. A modified regimen of conventional amphotericin B may lessen renal disease in such patients. In a trial of 368 patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, for example, a shorter course (five to seven days) of amphotericin B, with isotonic saline prehydration and cessation of therapy if the serum creatinine increased to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> produced equal efficacy, less nephrotoxicity, and greater reversibility of nephrotoxicity as compared with a standard 14-day course without prehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The long-term half-life of amphotericin (up to two weeks) provides ongoing fungicidal activity after discontinuing the drug, which may have accounted for the equal efficacy in patients treated with a shorter course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROLYTE DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increase in membrane permeability caused by amphotericin B is also thought to contribute to the electrolyte abnormalities that often occur. This defect results in the reduction of ion concentration gradients, which normally exist between the cytoplasm of distal tubule cells and the tubule lumen. In these cases, potassium leaks from the cytoplasm down a favorable concentration gradient into the lumen. Similarly, hydrogen ions diffuse down their gradient from the lumen into the cytoplasm of distal tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, an increase in tubular permeability will promote the back-diffusion of secreted hydrogen ions (or of H2CO3 formed by the combination of hydrogen with filtered bicarbonate), thereby limiting acid excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Hypomagnesaemia and renal magnesium wasting also occur as a result of amphotericin renal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Amphotericin B is one of three drugs (the other two are cyclosporin and cis-platinum) associated with major renal magnesium loss and magnesium depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The loss of magnesium and potassium may also be related in part to the systemic toxicity of the amphotericin B that causes these intracellular ions to leak into the extracellular fluid space and then be lost into the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The net effect of these changes is that both hypokalemia due to potassium loss and a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (ie, a distal renal tubular acidosis) due to hydrogen retention are commonly seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2,7,30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,30,32</a>]. Hypomagnesemia, though somewhat less common, is also reported. The distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) generated by amphotericin B, unlike most other forms of distal RTA, is associated with a normal urine-blood PCO2 after alkaline loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. This likely results from the previously mentioned back-diffusion of secreted hydrogen ions, but a loss of polarity of the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger is also consistent with this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Treatment of the hypokalemia and renal tubular acidosis consists of administering alkali with potassium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-distal-type-1-and-proximal-type-2-renal-tubular-acidosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of distal (type 1) and proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis&quot;, section on 'Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis'</a>.)</p><p>Amphotericin B may also cause resistance to antidiuretic hormone, leading to polyuria and polydipsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2,5,7,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7,36</a>].

In the randomized trial cited above, liposomal amphotericin B was associated with a significantly lower rate of hypokalemia (serum potassium concentration &le;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> but no significant change in the rate of hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium concentration &le;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When conventional amphotericin B is used, patients without significant renal impairment should receive daily preemptive administration of potassium, which may prevent serious hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In contrast to acute kidney injury, the manifestations of tubular dysfunction do not appear to be ameliorated by volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Treatment of the magnesium wasting consists of the administration of magnesium supplements. However, the efficacy of this regimen is limited by the urinary excretion of most of the supplemental magnesium.

This is probably mediated in part by binding of the drug to cholesterol in mammalian cell membranes and in part by deoxycholate, a detergent used as a solubilizing agent for the original formulation of amphotericin B. Deoxycholate is not contained in the liposomal preparation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of amphotericin B nephrotoxicity is increased by higher daily doses and concurrent therapy with other nephrotoxins, such as an aminoglycoside or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decline in GFR caused by amphotericin B, but not the manifestations of tubular dysfunction, is ameliorated by volume expansion with saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence and severity of nephrotoxicity can be minimized by administering amphotericin B in lipid-based formulations; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> may be less nephrotoxic than the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in membrane permeability induced by amphotericin B is thought to account for the electrolyte abnormalities that often occur: 1) back-diffusion of secreted hydrogen ion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> H2CO3 from the tubular lumen to the plasma best explains renal tubular acidosis; and 2) enhanced diffusion of potassium from the renal tubular cell to the tubular lumen down a favorable concentration gradient explains renal potassium wasting and hypokalemia. Renal magnesium wasting and hypomagnesemia may develop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amphotericin B may also cause resistance to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), leading to polyuria and polydipsia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liposomal preparations of amphotericin B are associated with a lower incidence of acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities. The nephrotoxicity associated with amphotericin B is usually reversible with discontinuation of therapy. However, recurrent renal dysfunction can occur if treatment is reinstituted.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amphotericin-b-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Branch RA.
