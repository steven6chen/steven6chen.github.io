Common changes associated with active disease include anemia of chronic disease (ACD; also termed anemia of chronic inflammation), thrombocytosis, and sometimes a mild leukocytosis. There is an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disease, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Felty's syndrome, with neutropenia and splenomegaly, is very infrequent.</p><p>An overview of the hematologic manifestations of RA is presented here. The clinical manifestations of RA; clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Felty's syndrome; and large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia in RA are discussed in detail separately.

In one analysis, the prevalence of anemia decreased between 2001 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Among the most prevalent hematologic abnormalities in patients with rheumatologic disorders are the anemia of chronic disease (ACD), a mild anemia that is generally asymptomatic, and iron deficiency anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. A 2008 study of 111 patients with early RA reported the prevalence of ACD to be 25 percent during the first year of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other forms of anemia occur less commonly. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anemia of chronic disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Iron deficiency anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Macrocytic anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hemolytic anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow hypoplasia with anemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pure red cell aplasia'</a> below.)</p><p>Estimates in studies from the early 1980s suggested a prevalence of anemia of about 30 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A 2004 analysis of the available data dating back to the 1960s was similar, with an estimated prevalence of 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a study from the Ukraine, in which anemia was observed in 46 percent of patients with RA, the presence of anemia was associated with high RA disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, a study from China found an association in patients with RA of anemia with erosive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The absolute and relative frequencies of different causes of anemia in RA were shown in a cohort of 2000 patients with RA who were followed in the United Kingdom over a period of one calendar year (2009), while receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and among whom 199 patients (10 percent) were identified as having anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of these, 90 (45 percent) had iron deficiency anemia, 78 (39 percent) had ACD, 25 (13 percent) had macrocytic anemia, and six (3 percent) had an anemia related to a recent surgery, usually a joint replacement or revision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3863989198\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Anemia of chronic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACD is common in patients with active RA. The pathogenesis of ACD is incompletely understood, but ACD is thought to primarily reflect a reduction in red blood cell (RBC) production by the bone marrow, with a component due to mild shortening of RBC survival. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of ACD are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with RA, changes in hemoglobin levels over time are associated with changes in disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A number of factors are thought to contribute to this hypoproliferative state in RA and in other conditions, including hepcidin-induced alterations in iron metabolism, inability to increase erythropoiesis in response to anemia, a relative decrease in erythropoietin (EPO) production, and, to a lesser extent, decreased red cell survival. Endogenous EPO synthesis appears to be impaired in RA patients as well as in their response to EPO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Low EPO levels and the diminished response to EPO contribute significantly to the anemia in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and polymorphisms in TNF receptor genes may be particularly important in RA, and TNF may have a role as one of the factors mediating ACD in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>). TNF-inhibition with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, a chimeric mouse human monoclonal antibody, resulted in dose-dependent increase in hemoglobin levels in RA patients with ACD compared with placebo. These changes were also accompanied by a reduction in serum levels of both EPO and interleukin (IL)-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>ACD is associated with the following laboratory abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two red cell indices, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), tend to be normal (ie, normocytic and normochromic) but can be decreased due to concurrent iron deficiency, often to values characteristic of microcytic hypochromic anemias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum levels of ferritin are elevated and the levels of transferrin and iron are low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced iron absorption and impaired release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system are typically observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow examination usually reveals the presence of hemosiderin and normal cellularity, with increased numbers (in most cases) of plasma cells that are associated with lymphoid aggregates.

These figures have decreased over the years, and one study found the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in RA to decrease from more than 24 percent in years before 2001 to 15 percent in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In patients with RA, iron deficiency is most often caused by chronic blood loss from gastritis (induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), peptic ulcer, or gastroesophageal reflux due to a diaphragmatic hernia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most cases of iron deficiency anemia are asymptomatic; but if severe, dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, tachycardia, and palpitations may occur.

Generally, in about 75 percent of RA patients who are found to have anemia, it is due to an ACD, and about 25 percent of anemic patients with RA will respond to iron therapy; however, both these subgroups of anemia may be found to have a superimposed vitamin B12 or folate deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One study of patients with RA and anemia noted vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency in 29 and 21 percent of 24 tested patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The characteristic morphologic changes of a macrocytic anemia may be masked by the changes induced by other causes of anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macrocytosis-macrocytic-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Macrocytosis/Macrocytic anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of macrocytic anemia may involve cardiopulmonary manifestations secondary to the anemia, gastrointestinal manifestations with or without malabsorption, as well as the typical neurologic and psychiatric features.

Drug-induced hemolysis may also occur. As an example, autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been induced by NSAIDs as well as by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Although extremely rare, this anemia may be severe. The condition tends to be reversible when the offending drug is withdrawn, but most patients require glucocorticoid therapy. In some patients, the hemolytic anemia is accompanied by signs of hypersensitivity. Reticulocytosis and low haptoglobin, as well as positive direct and indirect Coombs tests, are clues for diagnosis.

It should be considered when there is a severe normochromic anemia with a very low absolute reticulocyte count in the absence of obvious blood loss or hemolysis. Autoimmune suppression of erythroid stem cells, antirheumatic drugs, and parvovirus infection has been implicated in this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], although single case reports suggest that pure red cell aplasia could very rarely be an extraarticular manifestation of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Pure red cell aplasia is characterized as a normocytic anemia associated with the absence of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. There are no signs of regeneration in the peripheral blood, no polychromasia, and no reticulocytes, with normal leukopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and no enlargement of the spleen or lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-pure-red-cell-aplasia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired pure red cell aplasia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3869080217\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis of anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the patient with unexplained anemia is largely the same for patients with RA as for patients with other disorders or in the general population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99491\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99491 \">algorithm 1</a>); it is further informed by greater likelihood of certain conditions seen more often in association with RA (see <a href=\"#H3863989198\" class=\"local\">'Causes of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above). This approach to the patient with unexplained anemia is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients suspected of iron deficiency or ACD should undergo measurement of the serum iron and iron-binding capacity as well as the serum ferritin. However, since serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant, its level may not be reduced in a patient with iron deficiency in the setting of active inflammation. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in patients with RA may be difficult, since the routine laboratory indices with mild to moderate iron deficiency may overlap with the ACD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Thus, if iron deficiency is suspected, it may be most reliably verified by the absence of iron stores on bone marrow examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, bone marrow examination is usually unnecessary if the patient has clear signs of iron deficiency such as a mean cell volume below 85, serum ferritin concentration below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> and transferrin saturation &le;7 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In patients with RA with a hemoglobin less than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> other contributory causes, such as hemolysis or bleeding, should also be excluded. Patients with evidence of occult blood in the stool should be referred for evaluation by a gastroenterologist, just as in patients without RA. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination is usually indicated in the patient with some combination of iron deficiency anemia, epigastric pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occult blood in the stool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Iron-deficient RA patients are characterized by high iron stores (high ferritin levels) but low iron availability (low transferrin saturation). ACD is typically associated with a significantly higher ferritin concentration than found in pure iron deficiency anemia. By contrast, EPO levels are higher in patients with iron deficiency anemia compared with those with ACD. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as interleukin (IL)-6, correlate inversely with the magnitude of the anemia in RA patients.</p><p>Although not done routinely in clinical practice, measurement of serum soluble transferrin receptor (TfR) can help differentiate iron deficiency anemia from ACD. This was illustrated in a study of 27 patients with RA and anemia who had bone marrow aspiration that provided diagnostically useful specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Among the 15 patients with iron deficiency anemia (absent stainable iron), elevated serum levels (&gt;28.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> of soluble TfR were found in 14 (sensitivity 93 percent), while only one of 12 patients with adequate iron stores had an elevated soluble TfR level (specificity 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. RA patients with iron deficiency anemia show a rise in their serum EPO levels as the hemoglobin concentration falls, contrary to patients with ACD and RA, who do not increase their EPO levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective therapy of the patient with RA and anemia is based upon an accurate determination of the cause of the anemia (see <a href=\"#H3863989198\" class=\"local\">'Causes of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3869080217\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis of anemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above). The main intervention for ACD is control of disease activity, while iron and vitamin deficiencies are treated both by remediation of their respective causes and repletion. Immunosuppressive therapy may be needed for hemolytic anemia and pure red cell aplasia, while identification and removal of the offending drug may be required in patients with bone marrow hypoplasia.</p><p>Issues of importance in patients with RA and particular forms of anemia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia of chronic disease</strong> &ndash; ACD often responds to therapy directed against RA, including a nonbiologic or biologic DMARD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Decisions to use EPO should be limited to patients with marked, symptomatic anemia and to those who demonstrate persistent anemia despite specific RA treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Erythropoietin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Observations regarding the role of EPO in ACD in RA led to trials of recombinant EPO in patients with RA, resulting in improvement of the anemia in a few patients without apparent change in overall arthritic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,13,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,33</a>]. In one report, for example, 10 of 11 patients treated for 24 weeks had at least a 6 percentage point increase in hematocrit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

There are, however, no guidelines or recommendations for the treatment of anemic RA patients with EPO, since the goal of EPO therapy is usually to increase the hemoglobin level above 11 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">/dL,</span> and hemoglobin levels below 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> due to ACD are uncommon with the available therapies for RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A systematic review of the trials raised concerns regarding trial methods and noted that two of the three principal trials found no improvement in health-related quality-of-life measures, despite improvement in the level of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. High doses (usually 300 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/week</span> given subcutaneously once or twice weekly) are required, making this an expensive form of therapy. One specific role for EPO among patients with RA might be in the preparation for elective surgery.
