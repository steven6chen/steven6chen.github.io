Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma is generally divided into three types: systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), primary central nervous system lymphoma, and the primary effusion (&quot;body cavity&quot;) lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

The overwhelming majority of cases of PEL occur in HIV-infected patients. However, this lesion can occur in the absence of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>] and rarely has been seen following solid organ transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] and in chronic hepatitis C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>There appears to be a strong male predominance with men accounting for all 15 cases in one of the original descriptions, and for 10 of 11 cases in a separate single-institution study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. This may largely reflect the markedly increased prevalence of HIV infection among men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-pathobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H1560489307\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Although earlier studies of this rare condition had reported low CD4 counts in patients with PEL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], larger and more recent series do not support this observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/4,5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,17</a>]. Among those infected with HIV, patients with PEL are similar to those with other NHLs in age, race, and HIV transmission category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>As described below, human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) plays a role in the pathogenesis of PEL. Those individuals with other disorders related to HHV-8 infection have an increased risk for developing PEL, and vice-versa. These disorders include Kaposi's sarcoma and multicentric Castleman's disease.

The importance of EBV in lymphomatous transformation in this setting is uncertain, as opposed to its primary role in primary central nervous system lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].

It has been suggested that the cells represent a preterminal stage of B cell differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, others suggest that the development of PEL is not restricted to one stage of B cell differentiation and may represent transformation of B cells at different stages of ontogeny [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>PELs express a common gene profile that is distinct from that of other AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) or lymphomas in the immunocompetent population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This profile suggests that, unlike AIDS-related NHLs, the tumor cells are not of germinal center or memory cell origin. Rather, they more likely correspond to a stage of B cell development intermediate between that of immunoblasts and plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with PEL have HHV-8 infection and many patients also demonstrate evidence of EBV infection. While HHV-8 infection is required for the development of PEL, the mechanisms by which HHV-8 infection might promote tumor growth are uncertain. Loss of the HHV-8 genome results in the death of PEL cells, demonstrating that genes of this virus play a vital role in PEL cell survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The following latent gene products of HHV-8 appear to play significant roles in the development of PEL by promoting proliferation and impairing apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral cyclin (v-cyclin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral FLICE inhibitory protein (v-FLIP)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral interleukin-6</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral interleukin-8 receptor homolog (vIL8R), also known as viral G-protein coupled receptor homolog (vGPCR)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transmembrane protein K1</p><p/><p>Proposed pathogenic roles for LANA-1 in PEL development include tethering HHV-8 DNA to chromosomes during mitosis to permit segregation of HHV-8 episomes to the progeny cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], activation of EBV promotor regions in co-infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>], and inhibition of tumor suppressor genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p>V-cyclin binds and phosphorylates the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (KIP1), thereby inhibiting the negative cell cycle control function of p27Kip1 and promoting the rapid proliferation of PEL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Further, v-cyclin forms a complex with the CDK6 cyclin-dependent kinase to form an active kinase inhibitor that also promotes cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus <span class=\"nowrap\">(KSHV/HHV-8)</span> <em>K1</em> gene is expressed in PEL cells and is up-regulated when these cells enter the lytic phase of the virus life cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The product of this gene promotes the survival of infected cells and further dissemination of HHV-8. This occurs through the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), by disrupting cytokine regulation, and by its ability to bind and disrupt other proteins.</p><p>HHV-8 infection results in the constitutive activation of NF-kappa B in endothelial cells perhaps through the latent protein v-FLIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/35,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,43-45</a>]. Much like in other virally-mediated lymphomas, the survival of PEL cells depends on the unregulated production of NF-kB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Inhibition of NF-kappa B has been shown to induce apoptosis in PEL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. In addition, PEL cells contain a unique form of the molecular chaperone Hsp90, known as tumor-enriched Hsp90 (teHsp90), which forms a complex with KSHV viral proteins (oncoproteins) and co-chaperones. Inhibition of tumor-enriched Hsp90 with the teHsp90-specific inhibitor PU-H71 leads to the degradation of v-FLIP, downregulation of NF-kappa B, and apoptosis of PEL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In vitro antitumor activity was found to be synergistic with a BCL2 family inhibitor. Treatment with these inhibitors induced anti-tumor responses in mouse PEL-xenograft models.</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 may act as autocrine growth factors to promote lymphomagenesis and the growth of PEL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. The HHV-8 genome encodes viral IL-6, a cytokine that promotes plasmacytosis and angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Additional studies suggest that constitutive phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) in the cells of PELs occurs secondary to IL-10 and viral IL-6. Phosphorylation of STAT3 directly contributes to the malignant progression of PEL cells by activating the prosurvival (anti-apoptotic) protein survivin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) depend upon the extent and distribution of disease. PEL originates on serosal surfaces, including the pleura (60 to 90 percent), pericardium (up to 30 percent), peritoneum (30 to 60 percent), joint spaces, and, rarely, the meninges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/4,7,17,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,17,55</a>]. Most affected patients present with a symptomatic serous effusion containing high-grade, malignant lymphocytes, but with no detectable mass lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>]. As such, patients usually present with symptoms related to fluid accumulation such as dyspnea (from pleural or pericardial effusions), abdominal distension (from ascites), or joint swelling.</p><p>Radiographic testing in PEL reveals evidence of the local effusions. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) reveal the pleural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardial effusion, slight serosal (pleural, pericardial) thickening, and the absence of parenchymal abnormalities, solid masses, or mediastinal enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/7,18,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,56</a>].</p><p>Although PEL is characterized by its predilection for body cavities, these tumor cells may rarely appear as HHV-8 positive solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. These solid tumor variants predominantly occur in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>With increased screening measures for HIV, many patients are treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) before the development of complications such as PEL.

Over 90 percent of cases demonstrate expression of CD45. Other B cell (ie, CD19, CD20, CD79a) and T cell-associated antigens are typically negative, but can be seen in a fraction of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/16,22,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,62</a>]. Activation and plasma cell-related markers such as CD30, CD38, CD71, CD138, and epithelial membrane antigen are usually present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/30,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No characteristic genetic abnormalities have been identified in PEL but complex and recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in the tumor cells have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, immunoglobulin genes and T cell receptor genes are often rearranged and can be used to demonstrate a monoclonal B cell population by Southern blot analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/25,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key diagnostic criterion for primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is the presence of HHV-8 in the nuclei of the malignant cells. The most common method for detecting HHV-8 positivity is immunohistochemical staining for the latent viral gene product known as latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1). Despite the usual co-infection with EBV, staining for latent membrane protein (LMP1) is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for patients who present with an effusion that is subsequently found to contain lymphoma cells includes systemic lymphomas with secondary involvement of the body fluid (ie, secondary effusion), extranodal variants of various subtypes of lymphoma (eg, extranodal large cell lymphoma), and lymphomas that develop as a result of chronic pyothorax (ie, pyothorax associated lymphoma). Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is characteristically distinguished from all of these other types of lymphoma by its HHV-8 positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>In addition, there is a broad differential diagnosis for pleural effusions in HIV-infected patients which include both infectious and non-infectious causes. These are discussed in detail separately.

The defining biological feature of Burkitt lymphoma is MYC deregulation, which is not found in PEL. Ninety percent of the time the malignant cells of Burkitt lymphoma display a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8 (the site of the <em>MYC</em> oncogene) and one of three other chromosomes resulting in t(8;14), t(2;8), or t(8;22). The principal feature that distinguishes Burkitt lymphoma from PEL is its HHV8 negativity.

In contrast to PEL, these lymphomas have no association with immunosuppression and are HHV-8 negative. They also typically present with a tumor mass within the body cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging systems used for other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not useful in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) since all patients have stage IV disease by definition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-related-lymphomas-primary-effusion-lymphoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In addition, the International Prognostic Index used in most other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma has not been validated in patients with PEL.
