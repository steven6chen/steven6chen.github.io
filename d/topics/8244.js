Although hyperlipidemia does not cause symptoms, it can significantly increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including disease of blood vessels supplying the heart (coronary artery disease), brain (cerebrovascular disease), and limbs (peripheral vascular disease). These conditions can in turn lead to chest pain, heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. Because of these risks, treatment is often recommended for people with hyperlipidemia.</p><p>This topic reviews the risk factors for coronary artery disease (sometimes called just &ldquo;coronary disease&rdquo;), the types of lipids, and when cholesterol testing should begin. The treatment of high cholesterol is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-treatment-options-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High cholesterol treatment options (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR CORONARY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to hyperlipidemia, there are a number of other factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus, type 1 and 2 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Overview (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension (people with hypertension include those with a blood pressure at or above <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> and those who use blood pressure medication) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of coronary disease at a young age in a parents or sibling (young, in this case, means younger than 55 years for men and younger than 65 years for women) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender &ndash; Men have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than women at every age</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; There is an increasing risk of cardiovascular disease with increasing age</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIPID TYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term lipids includes cholesterol and triglycerides. There are many different types of lipids (also called lipoproteins). Blood tests can measure the level of your lipoproteins. The standard lipid blood tests include a measurement of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides. The very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol is estimated as 20 percent of the triglyceride concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Total cholesterol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high total cholesterol level can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. However, decisions about when to treat high cholesterol are usually based upon the level of LDL or HDL cholesterol rather than the level of total cholesterol.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total cholesterol level of less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is <strong>normal</strong>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total cholesterol level of 200 to 239 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.17 to 6.18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is <strong>borderline high</strong>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A total cholesterol level greater than or equal to 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is <strong>high</strong>.</p><p/><p>The total cholesterol level can be measured any time of day. It is not necessary to fast (avoid eating for 12 hours) before testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">LDL cholesterol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some health care practitioners make decisions about how to treat lipids based on the LDL cholesterol (sometimes called &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;). Higher LDL cholesterol levels increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. Your goal LDL cholesterol will depend on several factors, including any history of cardiovascular disease and your risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the future. (See <a href=\"#H53136463\" class=\"local\">'Calculating coronary disease risk'</a> below.) People at higher risk are often assigned a lower LDL cholesterol goal.</p><p>The LDL cholesterol is generally calculated (total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol minus VLDL cholesterol). The formula is valid when the triglycerides are less than 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Your health care professional may ask that you fast for nine hours or longer in order to obtain an accurate result. However, in many cases, your LDL cholesterol can be measured even after you have eaten recently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1069611546\"><span class=\"h2\">HDL cholesterol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all cholesterol is bad. Increased levels of HDL cholesterol actually lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. A level greater than or equal to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is excellent, while levels of HDL cholesterol less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> are lower than desirable. There is no treatment for raising HDL cholesterol that has been proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>Similar to total cholesterol, the HDL cholesterol can be measured on any blood specimen. It is not necessary to be fasting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824696354\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-HDL cholesterol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-HDL cholesterol is calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol. Since total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol can be measured without fasting, so can non-HDL cholesterol. Non-HDL cholesterol is a good predictor of cardiovascular risk and is a better predictor of risk than LDL cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in women.</p><p>An appropriate non-HDL cholesterol goal can be calculated by adding 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to your LDL cholesterol goal. As discussed, the LDL cholesterol goal depends on a number of factors. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'LDL cholesterol'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Triglycerides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High triglyceride levels are also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Triglyceride levels are divided as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal</strong> &ndash; Less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mildly increased </strong>&ndash; 150 to 499 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.7 to 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderately increased</strong> &ndash; 500 to 886 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 to 10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Very high</strong> &ndash; Greater than 886 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p/><p>Triglycerides should be measured after fasting for 12 to 14 hours. Some people with increased triglyceride levels may need treatment with medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53136463\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCULATING CORONARY DISEASE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An individual&rsquo;s risk for coronary disease can be calculated. We recommend using a risk calculator from a broad population (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN SHOULD MY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL BE TESTED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many expert groups have guidelines for cholesterol screening. The guidelines differ in their recommendations about when to start screening, how frequently you should be screened, and when to stop.</p><p>One expert group, the US Preventive Services Task Force, recommends the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipid screening should start at age 35 in men without other risk factors for coronary disease and at age 20 to 35 in men with risk factors. These include men with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A family history of heart disease in a close male relative younger than age 50 or a close female relative younger than age 60</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A family history of high cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A personal history of multiple coronary disease risk factors (eg, smoking, high blood pressure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipid screening should definitely start at age 45 and perhaps at age 20 in women with risk factors for coronary disease. No recommendation for or against screening was made for women without risk factors for coronary disease. UpToDate authors believe that even low risk women should be screened starting at age 45.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those at risk for coronary disease should be treated based upon the results of their screening test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening should include total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and can be measured with or without fasting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal time interval between screenings is uncertain; reasonable options include every five years, with a shorter interval for those with high-normal lipid levels and longer intervals for low-risk individuals with low or normal levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no recommendation to stop screening at a particular age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening may be appropriate in older people who have never been screened, although screening a second or third time is less important in older people because lipid levels are less likely to increase after age 65.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH CHOLESTEROL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment options for people with high cholesterol and lipids are discussed separately.
