It has been observed in nearly every arterial bed. The most often involved arteries are the renal and internal carotid arteries, and less often the vertebral, iliac, subclavian, and visceral arteries. When FMD occurs in the coronary arteries, the patient usually presents with a spontaneous coronary artery dissection.</p><p>Disease presentation may vary widely, depending upon the arterial segment involved and the severity of disease. The most common presenting manifestations are hypertension, headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and dizziness. Less common are transient ischemic attack and stroke.</p><p>Treatment options for patients with renal artery FMD include medical therapy alone, or revascularization by either percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, independent of angioplasty, hypertension should be treated.</p><p>The treatment of renal FMD will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder and the management of atherosclerotic renovascular disease and chronic kidney disease due to renal ischemia are discussed separately.

Options for management of hypertension in patients with FMD include antihypertensive drug therapy and revascularization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihypertensive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with renal FMD and hypertension will require antihypertensive therapy, even if they undergo revascularization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79702155\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying pathogenesis of the hypertension includes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and, in patients with bilateral disease or disease to a single functioning kidney, retention of sodium and water. Thus, the initial drug class of choice in FMD is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. If goal blood pressure is not reached with angiotensin inhibition alone, other antihypertensive drugs (such as a thiazide diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or a beta blocker) should be added as necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major potential complication of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is a hemodynamically mediated decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially if the stenotic lesions are severe and bilateral or occurring in a solitary kidney. The normal autoregulatory response to maintain GFR in the setting of reduced renal perfusion involves an angiotensin II-mediated preferential increase in resistance at the efferent (post-glomerular) arteriole. This is blunted by blocking angiotensin II formation with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, and the effect is more pronounced with volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. When it occurs, the rise in the plasma creatinine concentration is usually mild (10 to 30 percent increase) and acceptable. However, reversible acute kidney injury can occasionally occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ACE inhibitors and ARBs can also increase the plasma potassium concentration, particularly in patients with decreased GFR, an effect that may be countered by the concomitant use of a diuretic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, patients with FMD should have follow-up laboratory testing approximately one to two weeks after initiating an ACE inhibitor or ARB to assess for these potential side effects. The drug should be discontinued if acute kidney injury occurs or if hyperkalemia develops that is severe and cannot be controlled with other means, such as dietary potassium restriction or diuretic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79702162\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Goal blood pressure in patients with FMD is the same as in similarly aged hypertensive patients who have an etiology other than FMD.

Our suggestions pertaining to revascularization are therefore guided by lower-quality data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>We suggest that the following patients with renal FMD and hypertension undergo renal artery revascularization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with recent-onset hypertension, particularly younger patients who are less likely to have underlying atherosclerotic disease, in whom the goal is to cure hypertension or significantly reduce the number of antihypertensive medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with resistant hypertension despite compliance with an appropriate three-drug regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, risk factors, and evaluation of resistant hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-resistant-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of resistant hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those who are unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications or who are noncompliant with their medication regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults with bilateral renal FMD, or unilateral renal FMD to a single functioning kidney, who have otherwise unexplained progressive renal insufficiency that is thought to result from renal artery stenosis (ie, &quot;ischemic nephropathy&quot;). The clinical manifestations of ischemic nephropathy are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-kidney-disease-resulting-from-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease resulting from atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertensive children with renal FMD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90394202\"><span class=\"h3\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal rationale for renal artery revascularization is control of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Thus, in adult patients with relatively well-controlled hypertension, the risks of revascularization may outweigh the benefits. Children with FMD may be at higher risk than adults for progressive renal parenchymal loss, and therefore could benefit from revascularization even if their hypertension can be well-controlled with one or two antihypertensive medications.</p><p>In contrast to patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, hypertension is cured or improved (better blood pressure control on fewer antihypertensive agents) following revascularization in a large proportion of patients with FMD. The reported hypertension cure rate varies considerably from study to study, although hypertension control improves in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. Variability in cure rates depends in large part upon the definition of cure. As an example, a systematic review of 47 angioplasty studies reported a mean cure rate of 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, only 58 of 190 patients (31 percent) were cured when cure was defined as achievement of a blood pressure less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg without requiring antihypertensive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The rate of cure of hypertension may also be lower if FMD affects multiple vascular beds, or if the intrarenal vessels are involved. In one report, hypertension was cured following angioplasty in 62 versus 28 percent of patients with unilateral, isolated renal FMD versus systemic FMD, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, older patients and those with longer durations of hypertension have lower likelihoods of cure after revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p>There is also the possibility of delaying or preventing loss of renal mass and therefore chronic kidney disease by revascularizing patients with renal FMD. Progressive renal loss is uncommon in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], except in rare adults with focal (rather than multifocal) FMD due to intimal fibroplasia or, more commonly, in those with renal artery dissection. However, renal parenchymal loss is more common in children with renal FMD because such patients typically have intimal fibroplasia or perimedial fibroplasia, which are associated with a higher risk of progressive renal disease.</p><p>There are very few data reporting the efficacy of revascularization on stabilization of either GFR or renal size in patients with FMD. In one study of 20 patients with unilateral FMD undergoing revascularization, renal size of the affected kidney was smaller at baseline compared with the unaffected kidney but remained stable over a six-month period after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the follow-up in this study may have been too short to document progressive losses of renal parenchyma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Angioplasty versus surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two options for revascularization include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, typically without placing a stent) or surgery. There are no comparative trials, but PTA achieves similar technical success and is associated with a lower risk of adverse events in observational studies. Thus, we suggest that most patients with FMD who are selected for renal revascularization have PTA rather than surgery. However, we suggest surgery rather than PTA if PTA fails or if the arterial anatomy is not amenable to PTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], as in patients with small renal arteries (&lt;4 mm), with branch renal artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], or with extensive intimal fibroplasia. In addition, patients who fail PTA should have surgical repair.</p><p>Most patients have improvement of hypertension with PTA (better blood pressure control on fewer antihypertensive agents), although in only about one-third is blood pressure reduced to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;140/90</span> mmHg without requiring antihypertensive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/10-12,17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,17-22</a>]. Cure rates tend to be higher in series of surgical revascularization, in large part because of younger patient populations in such studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23-26</a>]. There are no contemporary studies assessing blood pressure response to surgery because virtually all patients (without an aneurysm) are treated with angioplasty.</p><p>The best data come from a meta-analysis of 70 observational studies that included 47 PTA series and 13 surgery series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Major findings from this analysis are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvement in blood pressure (including those with and without cure) was similar with PTA as compared with surgery (86 versus 88 percent).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cure rates were higher with surgery (54 versus 36 percent).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major adverse events were more frequent with surgery (15 versus 6 percent).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age and longer duration of hypertension prior to revascularization were significantly associated with a lower cure rate.</p><p/><p>In 21 patients with renal follow-up from two PTA studies, kidney function improved in 13 patients and remained stable in 8 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In various surgical series, improvement or stabilization of renal function was seen in up to 92 percent of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is typically performed <strong>without</strong> placement of stent (unlike PTA for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis). In general, stents are only placed when a dissection results from the performance of PTA or in the rare instance in which a perforation of the renal artery occurs during angioplasty. There are several reasons why a stent should not be used as first-line endovascular therapy in patients with FMD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients do very well with angioplasty alone, so there is no reason to place a stent. If the lesion is so fibrotic that the pressure gradient cannot be obliterated with an angioplasty, a stent will not correct this problem (and stent deformation will likely occur). Such patients should be referred for surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with renal FMD usually have stenoses in the mid and distal portions of the artery rather than at the ostium or proximal portion (as occurs with atherosclerosis). Should surgical revascularization become necessary due, for example, to in-stent restenosis, patients may require more complex branch repair to bypass the occluded stent since the stent often covers the renal artery up to the point of the first intrarenal branch.</p><p/><p>The reported technical (angiographic) success rates for PTA range from 83 to nearly 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Procedural success rates are lower for angioplasty alone in non-medial FMD (ie, intimal or perimedial FMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>For patients who undergo PTA or stent implantation for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, the rate of restenosis ranges from 12 to 34 percent over follow-up intervals of six months to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/5,17,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,28-30</a>]. However, it is difficult to determine if patients with FMD develop restenosis, or if the lesion was not completely treated correctly the first time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>In addition, restenosis is not necessarily associated with recurrent hypertension. Over long-term follow-up (mean 7.0&plusmn;4.7 years), FMD patients who underwent successful PTA showed significant and sustained reductions in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, and number of antihypertensive agents. Systolic blood pressure response was better in patients with FMD affecting the main renal artery than in patients with branch vessel involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Advances in guidewires, catheters, and balloons, as well as improvement in operator skill, have made it possible to perform PTA for even the most complex renal artery lesions. Cutting balloon angioplasty should not be used for lesions that do not respond to balloon angioplasty because the chance of rupture of the renal artery is much higher with a cutting balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>While many clinicians use visual inspection to determine if the angioplasty was adequate, it is becoming apparent visual inspection alone is <strong>not</strong> accurate. Thus, other methods are important to assure that the stenosis has been adequately treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic assessment should be performed using a pressure guidewire, with a mean gradient of &lt;5 mmHg across the treated segment suggesting a satisfactory result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is important to measure pressure gradients both before and after angioplasty to be certain that all of the intraluminal fibrous webs have been adequately disrupted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-procedure renal duplex scanning should also be used to assess the adequacy of intervention. In successfully treated patients, the degree of turbulence is less prominent, and velocity elevation in the mid-distal renal artery returns to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravascular ultrasound is occasionally used to evaluate the elimination or reduction of various endoluminal defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p>Stenting in the renal artery is associated with a restenosis rate of up to 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. If the patient either has no improvement in blood pressure or an initial improvement followed by recurrence of hypertension a few weeks after PTA, we recommend a repeat angiogram and PTA. In this case, &quot;restenosis&quot; may actually represent inadequate angioplasty during the first procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Hypertension that persists despite technically successful PTA, particularly if confirmed using intravascular ultrasound or a pressure guidewire, suggests that the cause of hypertension is unrelated to fibromuscular disease or is related to small vessel disease within the kidney (nephrosclerosis) due to longstanding hypertension.</p><p>Complications of PTA are mostly related to vascular access. In rare cases, renal artery perforation, dissection, or segmental renal infarction may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of complications has decreased, a trend attributed in part to use of more flexible guiding catheters and lower heparin doses. As an example, in a series of 268 patients who underwent 320 procedures, the complication rate decreased from 16 percent in 1998 to 3 percent in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortorenal bypass with a saphenous vein graft is the most commonly performed surgical revascularization procedure in patients with renal FMD, although artificial graft material is occasionally used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In pediatric patients, hypogastric artery grafts are used or else aortic reimplantation of the renal artery is performed because vein grafts become aneurysmal. As noted above, surgery for renal FMD is typically performed only when PTA fails or the anatomy is not amenable to PTA.</p><p>Renal artery aneurysms may be identified in patients with FMD. The aneurysms may rupture or lead to infarction from macroscopic embolization. Renal artery aneurysms may be treated percutaneously using a covered stent graft or coils or may be repaired surgically with minimal morbidity or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>Although both surgery and PTA lead to similar technical success rates, surgery is associated with markedly higher morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40</a>]. Perioperative mortality appears to be very low (eg, 1.2 percent in a meta-analysis of 17 surgical studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/11,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,41</a>]. Given that surgical revascularization is usually limited to complex cases, reported success and complication rates are probably higher than if simpler cases were included. In one series of 26 patients, 6 of whom had failed PTA and 20 who were unsuitable for PTA, there were two bypass occlusions resulting in renal loss, and five significant nonrenal complications during a median follow-up of 2.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia-of-the-renal-arteries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

FMD in the extracranial cerebrovasculature may be associated with dissection, stenosis, intracranial aneurysm, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke, or may be entirely asymptomatic. FMD may also affect other arterial beds such as mesenteric, iliac, and coronary arteries. In general, FMD in these locations is treated with revascularization (usually percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA]) only in symptomatic patients (eg, those patients with claudication, intestinal ischemic, coronary ischemia). Aneurysms can be treated with covered stents, coil embolization or surgical resection when the size warrants such treatment.</p><p>The treatment of cerebrovascular FMD also depends in part upon the absence or presence of symptoms. Antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is reasonable in all patients. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty is recommended for patients with TIA or stroke. Stenting is reserved for patients with suboptimal angioplasty results or for patients with a dissection who fail anticoagulation therapy. If there is an intracranial aneurysm present, then serial imaging (every 6 to 12 months) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) should be performed so that the aneurysm can be treated once it reaches a prespecified size.</p><p>Detailed discussions of the treatment of nonrenal FMD are presented in other topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracranial carotid aneurysms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracranial carotid artery aneurysm&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection of extracranial carotid vertebral arteries (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery dissection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric ischemic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonocclusive-mesenteric-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3601284853\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

It has been observed in nearly every arterial bed. The most often involved arteries are the renal and internal carotid arteries, and less often the vertebral, iliac, subclavian, and visceral arteries. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common manifestation of renal artery FMD is hypertension that is due to renal artery stenosis. Options for management of hypertension in patients with FMD include antihypertensive drug therapy and revascularization. Most patients with renal FMD and hypertension will require antihypertensive therapy, even if they undergo revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H79701418\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial antihypertensive drug class of choice in FMD is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If goal blood pressure is not reached with angiotensin inhibition alone, other antihypertensive drugs (such as a thiazide diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or a beta blocker) should be added as necessary. Goal blood pressure in patients with FMD is the same as in similarly aged hypertensive patients who have an etiology other than FMD. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antihypertensive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that the following patients with renal FMD and hypertension undergo renal artery revascularization rather than antihypertensive therapy alone (see <a href=\"#H79701501\" class=\"local\">'Indications for revascularization'</a> above) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those with recent-onset hypertension, particularly younger patients who are less likely to have underlying atherosclerotic disease, in whom the goal is to cure hypertension or significantly reduce the number of antihypertensive medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those with resistant hypertension despite compliance with an appropriate three-drug regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those who are unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications or who are noncompliant with their medication regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adults with bilateral renal FMD, or unilateral renal FMD to a single functioning kidney, who have otherwise unexplained progressive renal insufficiency that is thought to result from renal artery stenosis (ie, &quot;ischemic nephropathy&quot;). The clinical manifestations of ischemic nephropathy are presented elsewhere.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypertensive children with renal FMD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients with FMD who are selected for renal revascularization, we suggest percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) rather than surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, surgery is preferred if the arterial anatomy is not amenable to PTA, as in patients with small renal arteries (&lt;4 mm), with branch renal artery disease, or with extensive intimal fibroplasia. In addition, patients who fail PTA should have surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Angioplasty versus surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PTA is typically performed without placement of stent (unlike PTA for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis). In general, stents are only placed when a dissection results from the performance of PTA or in the rare instance in which a perforation of the renal artery occurs during angioplasty. When PTA is performed, physiologic assessment should be made using a pressure guidewire, with a mean gradient of &lt;5 mmHg across the treated segment suggesting a satisfactory result. It is important to measure pressure gradients both before and after angioplasty to be certain that all of the intraluminal fibrous webs have been adequately disrupted. Post-procedure renal duplex scanning should also be used to assess the adequacy of intervention. In successfully treated patients, the degree of turbulence is less prominent, and velocity elevation in the mid-distal renal artery returns to normal. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If surgery is performed, aortorenal bypass with a saphenous vein graft is the most commonly performed revascularization procedure in patients with renal FMD. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An important limitation of pursuing medical therapy alone is that renal artery stenosis and kidney dysfunction may progress despite good blood pressure control. As a result, every patient with FMD should have periodic measurement of serum creatinine every 6 months and duplex ultrasound every 6 to 12 months. Patients who undergo percutaneous revascularization should have duplex ultrasonography and serum creatinine measurements performed on the first office visit post procedure, then every six months for two years, and then yearly if stable.
