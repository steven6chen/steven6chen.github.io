But in rare cases, polio can cause a person's muscles to stop working (called &quot;paralysis&quot;) or death.</p><p>Polio used to be common in the US. But no cases have started in the US since 1979. In the mid-1950s, doctors started giving a vaccine to prevent polio. It is one of the vaccines doctors recommend for all babies.</p><p>Polio is a still a problem in parts of Asia and Africa. People who travel from those areas to the US might have the virus and could spread it to people who have not had the vaccine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8415318\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of polio?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with polio have no symptoms. A small number of people get symptoms that can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) and throwing up (vomiting)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p/><p>A small number of people who have polio also get more serious symptoms. These include weakness or paralysis that gets worse and worse for a few days. The weakness can affect the muscles of the legs, arms, and even the muscles that help you breathe and swallow. The legs are affected more often than the arms. Some people get severe weakness that leads to trouble walking, breathing, or swallowing.</p><p>People who are paralyzed from polio can have long-lasting problems. Many people who get muscle weakness do not regain full strength, although some do.</p><p>Many years later, some people who were paralyzed from polio can get a condition called &quot;post-polio syndrome.&quot; Symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New or worse muscle weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8415333\"><span class=\"h1\">How does polio spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poliovirus is most commonly spread by contact with the bowel movements (called &quot;feces&quot;) of a person infected with poliovirus. This can happen different ways, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating foods or drinking liquids that have poliovirus in them &ndash; This can happen if the food or water comes in contact with sewage water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touching surfaces or things that have feces from a person with the virus on them.</p><p/><p>Poliovirus can also be spread through saliva (also known as &quot;spit&quot;). That means people can also get polio by sharing food or utensils with an infected person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8415350\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for polio?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The main test for polio involves lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;). During this procedure, a doctor puts a thin needle into the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Another doctor then does lab tests on the spinal fluid to check for poliovirus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91257715\"><span class=\"h1\">How is polio treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to ease pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation &ndash; This involves using a machine that helps with breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8415365\"><span class=\"h1\">Can polio be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting the polio vaccine can prevent polio. This vaccine is given to babies in a series of 4 shots between the ages of 2 months and 6 years.</p><p>Most adults living in the US today got the vaccine during childhood. But adults who are traveling to countries where polio is still a problem should get a second series of the vaccine (called a polio &quot;booster&quot;) for extra protection.
