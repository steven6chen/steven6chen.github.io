A high index of suspicion is often necessary to expeditiously establish the diagnosis.</p><p>The hepatic metabolism of drugs and the mechanisms by which drugs might injure the liver will be reviewed here. The different clinical patterns of drug-induced hepatotoxicity and the use of medications in patients with liver disease are discussed separately.

Over 1000 medications and herbal products have been implicated in the development of DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. DILI has an estimated annual incidence of between 10 and 19 per 100,000 persons exposed to prescription medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. It accounts for up to 30 percent of cases of acute hepatitis, up to 10 percent of consultations by hepatologists, and is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>]. It is also the cause of acute jaundice in up to 50 percent of patients who present with new onset jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/8,9,13,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,13,21-26</a>]. Finally, DILI is the most frequently cited reason for the withdrawal of medications from the marketplace and the list continues to grow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/14,15,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,27-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245315203\"><span class=\"h2\">Database of drugs, herbs, and supplements associated with hepatotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains a <a href=\"http://www.livertox.nih.gov/&amp;token=2zSk/UZTeO3J4oIM4h1Di9fg9utsfkFQlC3ryKItrySs0myBELRJEc3r1dIl6tjF&amp;TOPIC_ID=3568\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">searchable database</a> of drugs, herbal medications, and dietary supplements that have been associated with DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, in 2004 the DILI Network initiated a prospective, observational, longitudinal study of individuals two years of age or older with suspected DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE LIVER IN DRUG METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver is responsible for the selective uptake, concentration, metabolism, and excretion of the majority of drugs and toxins that are introduced into the body. While some parent drugs can directly cause hepatotoxicity, it is generally the metabolites of these compounds that lead to drug-induced liver injury (DILI). These compounds are processed by a variety of soluble and membrane-bound enzymes, especially those related to the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum. Each drug has its specific enzyme disposal pathway(s) of biotransformation involving one or more of these enzyme systems. Genetic variation in drug metabolism is increasingly being recognized as a factor in the development of DILI. Although less clear, environmental factors (eg, alcohol use) may also alter the processing of drugs and toxins.</p><p>The majority of drugs absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract are lipophilic and water-insoluble. They are rendered water-soluble via hepatic metabolism and thus, more easily excreted in the bile or renally filtered. Exogenous products are hepatically metabolized predominantly through two mechanisms: phase I and phase II reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74094 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The subsequent products are then excreted via excretory transporters on either the canalicular or sinusoidal membranes (phase III reactions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase I reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase I reactions transform lipophilic molecules into more polar, hydrophilic molecules via oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis. These reactions are catalyzed by the membrane-bound cytochrome P450 superfamily of mixed function oxidases (CYP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. These hemoproteins are composed of an apoprotein and a heme prosthetic group (the oxidizing center).</p><p>Approximately 60 genes coding for CYP proteins have been identified in humans. These enzymes are organized into families (eg, CYP2) and subfamilies (eg, CYP2E1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The vast majority of these enzymes are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (microsomal-type) or the mitochondria (mitochondrial type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The microsomal-type is responsible for phase I drug metabolism.</p><p>Hepatic metabolism of exogenous drugs and toxins is performed mainly by the CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 families, with a smaller contribution from CYP4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-46</a>]. The remaining families are often highly specific for the metabolism of endogenous compounds and are not inducible by exogenous compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,47</a>]. The most important drug metabolizing member is CYP3A4, which comprises approximately 60 percent of all hepatic cytochromes and catalyzes the biotransformation of over 50 percent of commonly used drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,48</a>]. Free radicals and toxic electrophilic compounds can be produced during this process. These reactive metabolites can then lead to cellular injury and are important to the development of idiosyncratic DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">CYP activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytochrome activity varies considerably depending in part upon the concentration of the enzymes and the degree of induction by exogenous factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Factors influencing drug metabolism and the risk of DILI'</a> below.) Factors that alter the activity of an enzyme have the potential to increase the toxicity of a compound (either by reducing its conversion to nontoxic metabolites or by increasing its conversion to toxic metabolites) or to decrease its therapeutic effectiveness (eg, by increasing the rate of metabolism of active drug).</p><p>In some cases, alternate detoxification routes may become overloaded, leading to the development of hepatotoxicity. This may in part explain why some drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>) are not toxic in normal therapeutic doses, but are toxic when increased amounts are ingested. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-pathophysiology-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-poisoning-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase II reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase II reactions occur either directly with a parent compound (rare) or with a metabolite formed by a phase I reaction that is still not adequately hydrophilic for excretion. These reactions conjugate the drug or metabolic byproducts to highly polar ligands such as glucuronate, sulfate, acetate, glycine, glutathione, or a methyl group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74094\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74094 \">figure 1</a>). As a general rule, phase II reactions result in the formation of readily excreted, nontoxic substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/32,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,44</a>]. Phase II reactions occur predominantly within the hepatocyte cytoplasm via the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronyl transferases (UGT1 and UGT2), sulfotransferases, and glutathione S-transferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Conjugation ordinarily leads to a decrease in pharmacologic activity with enhanced clearance of the compound (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, and bilirubin), and these enzymes are rarely responsible for toxic metabolite formation. However, exceptions do occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and in some cases conjugation leads to increased pharmacologic activity. For example, glucuronidation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> leads to increased analgesic potency and sulfation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> is required for its antihypertensive effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase III reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phase III reactions lead to the transport of drugs and drug-products across the canalicular membranes and into the bile. The biliary transporters are members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and include multidrug resistant P-glycoprotein 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(MDR1/ABCB1),</span> MDR3 (ABCB4), multidrug resistant protein 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(MRP2/ABCC2),</span> and the bile salt export protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(BSEP/ABCB11)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The predominant role of these transporters is that of regulation of bile formation and the excretion of xenobiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Altered activity of these transporters may lead to hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors influencing drug metabolism and the risk of DILI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may alter the activity of any of these drug-metabolizing reactions and influence drug metabolism, contributing to hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These factors potentially alter the level of exposure to toxic drug products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118531904\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many genetic polymorphisms in the CYP isoenzymes and other drug-processing enzymes have been identified and associated with DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/36,47,60-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,47,60-67</a>]. Genetic alterations may contribute to diminished metabolism, lack of metabolism, or excessive metabolism of a compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This has been particularly well studied in the alcohol-metabolizing CYP2E1 subfamily and in the CYP2D6 subfamily, which is responsible for the metabolism of drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/1,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,69</a>]. This genetic variability may explain some of the individual hypersensitivity reactions to specific drugs.</p><p>Genetic polymorphisms in the phase II and the phase III enzymes also lead to both decreased and increased activity. This is seen in glutathione S-transferase, N-acetyltransferase 2,<em> </em>and<em> </em>UDP-glucuronosyltransferase B7, and has been associated with development of idiosyncratic DILI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-76</a>]. Certain genetic variations in the hepatobiliary transporters (BSEP, MDR3) may also predispose to drug-induced cholestasis or injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/55-57,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57,77</a>]. As an example, variable drug pharmacokinetics have been reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> depending upon which genetic variant of the phase III hepatobiliary enzyme was present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Another factor influencing the individual response to drugs is genetic polymorphisms of the major histocompatibility molecules (human leukocyte antigens [HLA]), several of which have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/78-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-82</a>]. Certain HLA types may favor presentation of the offending drug. As an example, a predominance of HLA-DR6 is seen in hepatitis caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>, and a predominance of HLA-A11 is seen in hepatitis from tricyclic antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In one study, patients with HLA DRB1*5701 had an 80-fold increased risk of hepatotoxicity due to flucloxacillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. There are also strong associations of hepatotoxicity with HLA DRB1*07 and the use of ximelagatran and with some HLA types and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/64,78,79,81,82,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,78,79,81,82,84</a>]. Cholestatic DILI is more common in those with HLA DRB1*15 and HLA DQB1*06 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/82,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,85,86</a>].</p><p>Idiosyncratic DILI is most often immune-mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. The regulation of the immune response is genetically determined, which may play a role in an individual's susceptibility to hepatotoxicity. In addition, genetic alterations in the hepatocytes themselves may contribute to risk of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4788380\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol ingestion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of alcohol in the development of DILI remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. Chronic alcohol ingestion increases CYP2E1 and CYP4A activity, an effect that lasts for up to 10 days following ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/91,93-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,93-97</a>]. Alcohol also inhibits the rate of glutathione synthesis, leading to accelerated glutathione turnover, and it impairs mitochondrial transport of glutathione (with sequestration within the mitochondria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/91,93,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,93,98</a>].</p><p>Drugs that have been reported to have increased hepatotoxicity when associated with alcohol intake are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, cocaine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1660400020\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction of CYP enzymes, particularly CYP1A2, has been observed with the ingestion of Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli), and charcoal-broiled beef [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38,100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,100-102</a>]. In contrast, grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A activity, primarily acting on the intestinal form of the enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/103-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-105</a>]. An excellent example is the interaction of grapefruit juice with the immunosuppressive agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>.</p><p>CYP activity may be increased by high-protein diets and reduced by low-protein diets and severe malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/106-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-109</a>]. Thus, states of severe malnutrition or chronic alcoholism with poor nutrition may influence certain detoxifying cofactors such as glutathione. Alternatively, obesity has been reported to increase the risk of DILI in the setting of halothane use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Presence of other drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concomitant use of two or more drugs may be one of the most important factors affecting components of the CYP system and influencing drug metabolism. A drug may act either as a cytochrome P450 inhibitor and slow another drug's metabolism, or it may induce CYP450 and enhance another drug's metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/38,110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,110-112</a>]. The adage that &quot;alcohol and drugs do not mix&quot; is based in part upon this phenomenon.</p><p>The list of drug interactions with the CYP system is vast. The aryl hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke can induce CYP1A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-and-the-liver-metabolism-and-mechanisms-of-injury/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Competitive inhibition of CYP can lead to clinically important drug interactions which are most pronounced when there is no alternative pathway for the metabolism of a potentially toxic drug or its metabolite. The most spectacular example is the development of torsade de pointes during the administration of terfenadine or cisapride (both no longer available in the United States) to a patient taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Drug-induced induction and inhibition of phase II enzymes are not uniformly seen. However, reduced phase II reactions have been described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> use.
