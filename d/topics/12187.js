A retrospective series describing orbital fractures in children reported a mean age of 12.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of these children, 81 percent were boys.</p><p>The low prevalence of orbital fractures among younger children may be related to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The face of a child is relatively small compared with the head, and thus, most fractures in young children tend to involve the upper face and skull [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, the proportion of cancellous to cortical bone is greater, providing more elasticity to the facial bones. In addition, sinus cavities are poorly developed. However, pneumatization of the frontal sinus may actually be protective for adults with injury to the superior orbital rim.

The frontal sinus is adjacent to the superior medial portion of the roof of the orbit. The supraorbital nerve runs through the supraorbital notch, which is located at the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the superior orbital rim.</p><p>The greater wing of the sphenoid bone and the zygoma (which is relatively thick) form the lateral wall of the orbit. The lateral canthal ligament attaches to the zygoma.</p><p>The zygoma and the thin maxillary bone comprise the infraorbital rim and the floor of the orbit. The inferior oblique and inferior rectus muscles lie above the floor of the orbit. The maxillary sinus is beneath the orbital floor.

Factors that influence the location and extent of the fracture include the mechanism of injury and the age of the patient. Injury to adjacent structures can also occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Orbital zygomatic fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The orbital zygomatic region is the most common location of a fracture of the orbital rim. This injury is typically the result of a high-impact blow to the lateral orbit. There is often an associated fracture of the orbital floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasoethmoid fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures in the nasoethmoidal region of the medial orbital rim are also common. In a retrospective series of adult patients, 32 percent of fractures occurred in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fracture of the maxillary bone in this portion of the orbital rim can result in disruption of the medial canthal ligament and the lacrimal duct system. In addition, the medial rectus muscle may become trapped in fractures of the medial wall of the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Orbital floor fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the floor of the orbit, sometimes known as &quot;blowout fractures,&quot; typically occur when a small round object, such as a baseball, strikes the eye. Experimental evidence suggests that orbital floor fractures may be caused by one or both of the following mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intraocular pressure as the result of posterior displacement of the globe (hydraulic theory)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A direct blow to the infraorbital rim</p><p/><p>In children, the floor of the orbit is more flexible. Consequently, it may fracture in a linear pattern creating a bone fragment that snaps back to create a &quot;trap-door&quot; fracture. In adults, the floor of the orbit is thinner and more likely to shatter when exposed to force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A significant consequence of fractures of the orbital floor is entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> orbital fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79690 \">picture 1</a>). Ischemia and subsequent loss of muscle function may occur either because of entrapment of muscle within the fracture fragment (more likely in children), or as the result of edema and hemorrhage of muscle and extraocular fat that have prolapsed through the fracture into the maxillary sinus (more likely in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/4,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12-14</a>].</p><p>Enophthalmos (the eye is receded into the orbit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76971\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76971 \">picture 2</a>)) may develop when the globe is displaced posteriorly in association with an orbital floor fracture and prolapse of tissue into the maxillary sinus. Orbital dystopia (the eye on the affected side is lower in the horizontal plane than the other) may occur because entrapped muscle and orbital fat pull the eye downward.</p><p>Injury to the infraorbital nerve (resulting in decreased sensation along the cheek, upper lip, or upper gingiva) may occur as the result of an orbital floor fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Orbital roof fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orbital roof fractures are more common in younger patients (less than 10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/orbital-fractures/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This phenomenon is probably related to the high cranium-to-midface ratio of young children as compared with adults (thus exposing a larger upper surface for injury). In addition, pneumatization of the frontal sinus helps the adult skull dissipate energy from forces to the superior orbital rim. As expected, orbital roof fractures have a high association with intracranial injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid overview that includes key clinical features and the diagnostic evaluation of orbital fractures is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61925\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61925 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The first priority in the evaluation of patients who may have orbital fractures is to identify life-threatening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serious associated injuries (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>).

Numbness of the forehead suggests damage to the supraorbital nerve as the result of injury to the superior orbital rim or roof of the orbit.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting are common following eye injury.

The eye should be examined with visual acuity performed as quickly as possible because soft tissue swelling may make it difficult for the patient to open their eyes or for the clinician to separate the eyelids. Care should be taken not to put pressure on the eye, which, in the presence of a globe rupture, could cause extrusion of intraocular contents.</p><p>Deformity involving any of the facial bones should be noted. Tenderness, crepitus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> step-off on palpation of the malar eminences, zygomatic arches, or orbital rims may indicate an underlying fracture.</p><p>Examination of the eyelids and surrounding soft tissue may demonstrate crepitus, indicating orbital emphysema as the result of fracture into a sinus. Injury to the lacrimal ducts can occur as the result of lacerations or soft tissue injury along the medial canthus.
