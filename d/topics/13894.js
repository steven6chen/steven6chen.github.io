(See <a href=\"#H1059672024\" class=\"local\">'Identification of high-risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p>Among high-risk patients who are not hypotensive, we generally stop ACE inhibitors and ARBs if patients are receiving other nephrotoxins, particularly in the setting of pancreatitis or sepsis.</p><p>The management of high-risk patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs preoperatively is discussed elsewhere.

Details concerning the studies that have examined this issue are available in separate topic reviews.

The best data are provided by a meta-analysis of 20 randomized, controlled trials that investigated the renoprotective effects of perioperative hemodynamic optimization among 4220 surgical patients who were undergoing elective or emergent procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/possible-prevention-and-therapy-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Postoperative AKI was reduced by perioperative hemodynamic optimization compared with the control group (odds ratios [OR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.83). This benefit was seen when optimization was initiated preoperatively, as well as intraoperatively and postoperatively, suggesting that ischemic injury can be prevented or effectively treated with prompt reperfusion.</p><p>Fluid administration should be assessed at regular intervals intraoperatively and postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inotropes should be reserved for consideration in patients with remarkable hemodynamic instability despite adequate volume repletion.

AKI is commonly, though not always, caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), particularly among critically ill hospitalized patients. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Acute kidney injury (AKI) versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedures and conditions that are more commonly associated with ATN include major surgery (particularly cardiac surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery, surgery to correct obstructive jaundice, emergent surgery, or re-exploration surgery), sepsis, marked hypovolemia, severe pancreatitis, cardiogenic shock, and hemorrhagic shock. (See <a href=\"#H1059672024\" class=\"local\">'Identification of high-risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at high risk for AKI should be identified early. Comorbidities that are associated with increased AKI risk include chronic kidney disease (CKD; either reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or proteinuria with normal eGFR), severe atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, advanced malignancy, obesity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor nutrition, and heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H1059672024\" class=\"local\">'Identification of high-risk patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are at high risk for ischemic ATN should have interventions to prevent AKI. Interventions include optimizing volume status and avoiding or stopping nephrotoxins, if possible. We do not administer any pharmacologic agent (such as diuretics or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fenoldopam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fenoldopam</a>)</span> for the prevention of ischemic ATN. (See <a href=\"#H3503759147\" class=\"local\">'Interventions to decrease risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early measures to treat established ischemic ATN include the maintenance of adequate hemodynamic status to ensure renal perfusion and the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins to prevent further kidney injury. We do not use diuretics or any other pharmacologic agents to treat ATN, although diuretics may be used to manage volume status. (See <a href=\"#H1062219813\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple pharmacologic agents and methods are under evaluation to assist in the prevention and <span class=\"nowrap\">treatment/recovery</span> of AKI.
