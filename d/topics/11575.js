Compared with most other subtypes of breast cancer, a higher percentage of HER2-positive patients achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), even in the absence of HER2-targeted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Using targeted therapy to block activation of those pathways further enhances the chemosensitivity of HER2-positive breast cancer, increasing the pCR rate. Clinical trial results from the last few years suggest that newer HER2-targeted agents may allow more effective inhibition of HER2 and expand options for the NACT regimen administered with HER2-targeted therapy based on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors and overall medical condition.</p><p>This topic will review issues pertaining specifically to administration of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-neoadjuvant-therapy-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Adjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive disease who have received neoadjuvant treatment is also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer#H2265801069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Patients who were treated with neoadjuvant therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3102275113\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is appropriate for many patients with locally advanced breast cancer regardless of subtype, because a response may allow both less extensive surgery and improved surgical outcomes. We generally define locally advanced as stage III cancers as well as the subset of IIB cancers with T3 disease. In addition, patients with earlier-stage, HER2-positive disease (stage I or II) may also be candidates for neoadjuvant therapy if they meet any of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient desires breast-conserving surgery (BCS) but is not a candidate for BCS or is likely to have a suboptimal cosmetic outcome with BCS due to tumor location or size relative to the size of the patient&rsquo;s breast, and may be a better candidate if neoadjuvant therapy decreases the extent of her tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has limited axillary nodal involvement (N1), for which axillary lymph node dissection would be standard surgical management, but could be a candidate for sentinel lymph node sampling alone if converted to node-negative disease with neoadjuvant therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery must be postponed awaiting consultation with plastic surgery regarding breast reconstruction, results of genetic testing or resolution of an intercurrent illness, including pregnancy, and the patient and treating clinicians do not wish to delay initiation of treatment.</p><p/><p>These considerations are particularly suited to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, given the high rates of both clinical and pathologic response seen with neoadjuvant therapy, particularly if treatment includes a HER2-directed agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>For patients with HER2-positive disease who proceed directly to surgery without receiving neoadjuvant treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy with HER2-directed therapy is appropriate.

While some of the clinical trials discussed below used different definitions of pCR, including absence of residual invasive disease in the breast regardless of the status of the axillary nodes <span class=\"nowrap\">(ypT0/is</span> Nany), the most widely accepted definition requires the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast and the absence of cancer in any sampled axillary nodes <span class=\"nowrap\">(ypT0/is</span> ypN0). Although it is a surrogate outcome measure, achievement of pCR is associated with highly significant improved rates of disease-free and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>].</p><p>In a 2016 meta-analysis of 36 trials enrolling nearly 5800 patients with HER2-positive disease receiving neoadjuvant therapy, those who achieved a pCR (including breast and axilla) had superior EFS and OS compared with those who did not (hazard ratio [HR] EFS 0.37, 95% CI 0.32-0.43; HR OS 0.34, 95% CI 0.26-0.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The association was even stronger in the hormone receptor-negative subgroup (HR EFS 0.29, 95% CI 0.24-0.36). A previous meta-analysis including approximately 2000 patients with HER2-positive disease showed similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H60449804\" class=\"local\">'Tumor prognostic features'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients with HER2-positive cancers who do not achieve a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those with minimal residual invasive disease at surgery have a better prognosis than those with more extensive residual disease. Though not yet validated in prospective clinical trials, retrospective analyses using the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) scoring system have shown it to be predictive of relapse-free survival at 5 and 10 years in patients with HER2-positive cancers and that patients with minimal residual disease (RCB class I) have improved outcomes compared with the overall group of non-pCRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915041628\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive disease consists of chemotherapy and HER2-directed therapy, specifically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pertuzumab</a> (see <a href=\"#H487979734\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1989289272\" class=\"local\">'Biologic therapy'</a> below). The use of pertuzumab is somewhat controversial and is discussed in further detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3659552426\" class=\"local\">'Pertuzumab'</a> below.)</p><p>While all systemic therapy given for nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer is intended to reduce the risk of distant recurrence, the additional rationale for administering it in the neoadjuvant setting is to downstage a tumor preoperatively, potentially allowing for less extensive surgery and improved cosmetic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-her2-positive-breast-cancer/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].

However, since patients with HER2-positive cancers typically receive a year of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting, the standard of care for patients who received trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting has been for these patients to resume trastuzumab after surgery and complete a year of treatment.
