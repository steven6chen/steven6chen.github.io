In the United States, gallstones are seen in approximately 6 percent of men and 9 percent of women. Most individuals with gallstones are asymptomatic throughout their lives. When the stones start causing symptoms, the condition is referred to as gallstone disease. Uncomplicated gallstone disease refers to stones in the gallbladder that are associated with biliary colic in the absence of complications such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or gallstone pancreatitis.</p><p>Determining whether a patient's upper digestive symptoms are the result of gallstones detected on imaging can be challenging. While both gallstones and upper digestive symptoms are common in the general population, they are not always related. Differentiating patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease from those with other disorders and an incidental finding of gallstones is important since cholecystectomy is often curative in those with symptomatic gallstones, but it exposes those with incidental gallstones to unnecessary risk, delays appropriate treatment for the actual cause of symptoms, and incurs unnecessary expense.</p><p>This topic will review uncomplicated gallstone disease. The epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones, the approach to patients with an incidental finding of gallstones, gallstone disease in pregnant women, and the complications of gallstone disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with incidental gallstones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallstones in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-acute-pancreatitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Gallstones'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The discussion that follows is generally consistent with <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6241?etoc=&amp;token=pvjxet6noCjROA9KC807zb4M/btqvZaeIbnP3JAdP4sTJAvqSdrP6ICy2ealV9lX1szpeJ3FcTE+NFzJQS36mg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=654\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a> from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73972061\"><span class=\"h1\">CATEGORIZATION OF PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When considering gallstone disease, we have found it helpful to categorize patients into the following clinical groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 1: Gallstones on imaging studies but without symptoms (incidental gallstones)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 2: Typical biliary symptoms and gallstones on imaging studies with no evidence of complications (uncomplicated gallstone disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 3: Atypical symptoms and gallstones on imaging studies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 4: Typical biliary symptoms but without gallstones on ultrasound</p><p/><p>As will be discussed below, the approach to patients in categories 1 and 2 is generally straightforward. Patients in category 1 should generally be left alone, while those in category 2 should undergo treatment aimed at eliminating the gallstones. By contrast, optimal approaches to patients who fall into the last two categories (3 and 4) are less clear. Management of such patients should be individualized and depends largely upon the likelihood (based upon clinical features and diagnostic testing) that the patient's symptoms are related to the gallstones. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243183886\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with gallstones are asymptomatic and will remain so throughout their lives. Of those with incidental (asymptomatic) gallstones, approximately 20 percent will develop symptoms over 15 years of follow-up, but their initial symptoms are typically not severe. The mortality rate related to incidental gallstone disease is significantly less than that associated with treatment, which is why most experts advise against a cholecystectomy for patients with asymptomatic gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-incidental-gallstones#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with incidental gallstones&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients who develop symptoms, a significant number will subsequently develop complications, which is why prophylactic cholecystectomy is advised once biliary symptoms develop. This is based on a variety of large population studies that, on the whole, indicate that once the initial uncomplicated biliary symptoms develop, the chance of recurring symptoms is approximately 30 percent per year in the first two years, and the chance of developing complications is approximately 2 to 3 percent per year. Once a complication develops, the chance of having additional, often more severe, complications is approximately 30 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].</p><p>Complications that may develop in patients with gallstones include acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis with or without acute cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis. Acute cholecystitis is the most common complication. In a systematic review, it was seen in 6 to 11 percent of patients with symptomatic gallstones over a median follow-up of 7 to 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rare complications include gallbladder cancer, gallstone ileus, and Mirizzi syndrome (impaction of a gallstone in the cystic duct, causing compression of the common bile or hepatic duct). </p><p>Patients with asymptomatic gallstones appear to have a slightly lower risk of complications than those with symptomatic gallstones. This was demonstrated in a study that followed 123 patients with asymptomatic gallstones and 298 patients with mild symptoms due to gallstones for up to 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It found that the cumulative probability of developing severe complications was lower among patients with asymptomatic gallstones compared with those with mild symptoms after 5, 10, 15, and 20 years of follow-up (4 versus 5 percent, 5 versus 12 percent, 10 versus 15 percent, and 16 versus 18 percent, respectively; p = 0.03). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease typically present with biliary colic, normal physical examination findings, and normal laboratory test results. Patients often report associated diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p>While patients may present with atypical symptoms such as chest pain or nonspecific abdominal discomfort, the absence of biliary colic should prompt an investigation for alternative diagnoses. On the other hand, biliary colic that is associated with fevers, jaundice, or abnormal blood tests (leukocytosis, liver tests, pancreas tests) suggests the development of a complication of gallstone disease. (See <a href=\"#H58360586\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8995491\"><span class=\"h2\">Biliary colic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the name, the pain of biliary colic is usually constant and not colicky. The classic description is of an intense, dull discomfort located in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, or (less often) substernal area that may radiate to the back (particularly the right shoulder blade) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The pain is often associated with diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. It is not exacerbated by movement and is not relieved by squatting, bowel movements, or passage of flatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pain typically lasts at least 30 minutes, plateauing within an hour. The pain then starts to subside, with an entire attack usually lasting less than six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Biliary colic is usually caused by the gallbladder contracting in response to hormonal or neural stimulation, forcing a stone (or possibly sludge) against the gallbladder outlet or cystic duct opening, leading to increased intra-gallbladder pressure. This increase in pressure then results in pain. As the gallbladder relaxes, the stones often fall back from the cystic duct, and the pain slowly subsides. In many patients, the pain is not severe, which is why patients often have had several attacks before seeking medical attention. </p><p>Eating a fatty meal is a common trigger for gallbladder contraction, and many patients report postprandial pain. However, an association with meals is not universal, and in a significant proportion of patients the pain is nocturnal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The frequency of recurrent attacks is variable, ranging from hours to years, though most patients do not have symptoms on a daily basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Typically, the pain has a characteristic pattern and timing for an individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22973364\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous symptoms other than biliary colic have been reported in patients with gallstones, but their predictive value for the presence of gallstone disease is poor. In many cases they may coexist with biliary colic but may or may not be related to the gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Atypical symptoms seen in patients with gallstones include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonspecific abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fullness after <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/early</span> satiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid regurgitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">distension/bloating</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epigastric or retrosternal burning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting without biliary colic</p><p/><p>Whether atypical symptoms are due to the gallstones or due to a coexistent problem can be difficult to determine. Patients with atypical symptoms without associated biliary colic should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, even if gallstones are demonstrated on imaging. (See <a href=\"#H58360586\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8995514\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with biliary colic due to uncomplicated gallstone disease are usually not ill-appearing and do not have fever or tachycardia. The pain is often not severe enough to bring the patient to the emergency department. If a patient does present during a pain episode, the abdominal examination is generally benign. Biliary colic is visceral pain, and there are no peritoneal signs because the gallbladder is not inflamed. However, voluntary guarding may be encountered depending upon the severity of the pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8995574\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies should be normal in patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease, both during asymptomatic periods and during attacks of pain. Abnormal blood tests (leukocytosis, elevated liver or pancreas tests) suggest the development of a complication of gallstone disease, such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholangitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholangitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58365548\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease will have gallstones demonstrated on transabdominal ultrasound. Other imaging studies, such as plain abdominal radiographs or computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen, are less sensitive than ultrasound, though patients may have had the tests as part of the general evaluation of their abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Plain abdominal radiographs rarely reveal gallstones because only approximately 10 percent of gallstones contain enough calcium to make them sufficiently radio-opaque to be visible on a plain radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71203\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71203 \">image 1</a>). The sensitivity of CT scan for gallstones has been reported to be 55 to 80 percent. Gallstones may be missed on CT because many stones are isodense with bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of uncomplicated gallstone disease should be suspected in a patient with biliary colic, a normal physical examination, and normal laboratory tests (complete blood count, aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase). Such patients should undergo an imaging study to determine if there are gallbladder stones or sludge. Typically, the evaluation begins with a transabdominal ultrasound since it is the most sensitive modality for detecting gallbladder stones. If the transabdominal ultrasound is negative in a patient with biliary colic, additional studies that may help with the diagnosis include endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and bile microscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Transabdominal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transabdominal ultrasound is generally considered to be the most useful test to detect the presence of gallstones since it is noninvasive, readily available, relatively inexpensive, and does not subject the patient to ionizing radiation. The examination should be conducted with the patient having fasted for at least eight hours because stones are best seen when surrounded by bile in a distended gallbladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58361345\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristics of stones on ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease may have ultrasound findings of gallstones, gravel, or sludge. Distinguishing among these three entities is generally not clinically important because they are managed identically. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>On ultrasound, gallstones appear as echogenic foci that cast an acoustic shadow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70175\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70175 \">image 2</a>) and seek gravitational dependency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Gravel is the appearance of multiple small stones that are echogenic and cast shadows. Sludge is echogenic in appearance but does not cast an acoustic shadow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F88946\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88946 \">image 3</a>). It is also more viscous and does not move to the dependent portion of the gallbladder as rapidly as gravel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The sludge seen on ultrasound represents microlithiasis (lithogenic bile that contains cholesterol monohydrate crystals, bilirubin granules, and a mucus glycoprotein gel) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Microlithiasis can produce biliary colic and lead to complications such as acute cholangitis and acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. It may also progress to macroscopic gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. </p><p>False-negative or misleading results may be obtained if the gallbladder is completely filled with stones or if it is contracted around many stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F97751\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97751 \">image 4</a>). In such cases, the findings may be confused with gas in a partially collapsed duodenal bulb, emphysematous cholecystitis, porcelain gallbladder, or a calcified hepatic artery aneurysm. False-positive results may be seen if gallbladder polyps are present since they produce sonographic images similar to those seen with gallstones, though they do not cast an acoustic shadow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70175\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70175 \">image 2</a>). The ultrasonographer performing the procedure regularly uses specific maneuvers and techniques to identify and distinguish gallstones from some of these other entities. As a result, ultrasonography is highly operator-dependent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-polyps-and-cholesterolosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder polyps and cholesterolosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58360944\"><span class=\"h3\">Test characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have evaluated the ability of transabdominal ultrasound to detect gallstones, though it is important to recognize that precise estimates of sensitivity and specificity are difficult to determine since surgical confirmation of a negative sonogram is unlikely. </p><p>A systematic review estimated that the sensitivity was 84 percent (95% confidence interval [CI] 76 to 99%) and specificity was 99 percent (95% CI 97 to 100%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Rarely, advanced scarring and contraction of the gallbladder around gallstones leads to nonvisualization of the gallbladder lumen, which has a specificity of 96 percent, but it should also raise the possibility of gallbladder cancer. </p><p>When compared with other cross-sectional imaging modalities and cholecystography, ultrasound has the highest sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Modern sonographic equipment is able to detect stones as small as 1.5 to 2 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Smaller stones may be missed, and the sensitivity falls to 50 to 60 percent for stones less than 3 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. </p><p>The accuracy of transabdominal ultrasonography is operator-dependent. The entire gallbladder must be examined axially and sagittally. Every effort should be made to examine the outlet of the gallbladder (Hartmann's pouch), where gallstones may be difficult to detect. The gallbladder neck must be traced all the way into the porta hepatis to exclude stones in this region. If an out-pouching from the gallbladder (Phrygian cap) is present, the redundant portion of the fundus must not be overlooked.</p><p>Even with an experienced operator, it is difficult to determine the number or size of stones in the gallbladder with transabdominal ultrasound. This is especially true for very small stones (1 or 2 mm in diameter) that frequently, when present in large numbers, can appear on transabdominal ultrasound as one large stone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150685460\"><span class=\"h2\">Next steps if the ultrasound is negative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with symptoms that do not fit the classic description for biliary colic, an evaluation for non-biliary causes for the patient's symptoms should be pursued. However, in a patient with classic biliary colic, if the initial transabdominal ultrasound was negative, additional testing to detect missed gallstones, sludge, or microlithiasis is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H58360586\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65536788\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with typical biliary colic but no gallstones on ultrasonography, we usually repeat the transabdominal ultrasound in a few weeks. If the repeat transabdominal ultrasound is negative, the patient may have microlithiasis or may be a category 4 patient (typical biliary symptoms without gallstones on ultrasound). In such patients the next step is debatable. The approach depends on the patient's preferences, age, and risk factors for adverse outcomes with invasive procedures. </p><p>The more definitive approach is to proceed with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to look for missed stones or sludge and, if the EUS is negative, obtain samples of bile for bile microscopy to evaluate for microlithiasis. However, some centers recommend cholecystokinin-stimulated cholescintigraphy before an EUS with bile sampling. Cholescintigraphy is more widely available and less invasive. A positive result (low gallbladder ejection fraction) suggests functional gallbladder disorder, though it may also be seen in the setting of microlithiasis or sludge and microcrystals that are interfering with bile ejection through the cystic duct. Differentiating between the two entities is typically not required since both conditions are treated with cholecystectomy. If the cholescintigraphy is normal, EUS can then be pursued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-gallbladder-disorder-in-adults#H366143604\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional gallbladder disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'CCK-stimulated cholescintigraphy'</a>.)</p><p>If medical dissolution therapy with oral bile acids is being considered, EUS with bile collection for microscopy should be done first to confirm the presence of microlithiasis or sludge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F88946\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88946 \">image 3</a>). Many patients with microlithiasis will respond to a one- to two-year course of oral bile acid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones#H3565731258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical treatment of gallstones&quot;, section on 'Bile acid therapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65536795\"><span class=\"h3\">Repeat transabdominal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repeating the transabdominal ultrasound increases the sensitivity for detecting stones, particularly if they are smaller than 3 mm in diameter. A repeat examination should pay particular attention to regions of the gallbladder where stones are easily overlooked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Patients with a negative repeat transabdominal ultrasound may still have microlithiasis or small stones that were missed. EUS and bile microscopy may identify missed stones or microlithiasis. These tests also both include an upper endoscopy, which also helps to exclude other conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease. If no stones are seen with EUS and bile microscopy, other disorders in the differential diagnosis of biliary colic (eg, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or functional gallbladder disorder) should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H58360586\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>It is important to thoroughly evaluate category 4 patients who have biliary colic but negative transabdominal ultrasounds because patients with missed stones or microlithiasis will typically respond to cholecystectomy. However, patients with other diagnoses, such as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia, or irritable bowel syndrome, may not improve or may even worsen following cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-dyspepsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with dyspepsia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-gallbladder-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional gallbladder disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58361831\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging of the gallbladder can be obtained by EUS. During EUS, an ultrasound transducer on the tip of an endoscope is placed into contact with the gastric antrum, which is in close proximity to the gallbladder. This permits gallbladder visualization without interference from bowel gas, subcutaneous tissue, or the liver. As a result, EUS is more sensitive than transabdominal ultrasound for the detection of gallstones, particularly in patients who are obese or have other anatomic considerations that limit gallbladder visualization with transabdominal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that EUS is useful for the detection of small stones and microlithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. In one study of 45 patients in whom there was a clinical suspicion of cholelithiasis but with at least two normal transabdominal ultrasound examinations, EUS detected evidence of cholelithiasis in 26 patients (58 percent). The sensitivity and specificity of EUS for detecting cholelithiasis were 96 and 86 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>In a second study of 89 patients with acute pancreatitis, EUS revealed small gallbladder stones (1 to 9 mm) in 14 of 18 patients who had otherwise negative standard imaging studies, including transabdominal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy confirmed the presence of stones in all 14 patients. None of the remaining four patients developed evidence of cholelithiasis during a median follow-up of 22 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8996071\"><span class=\"h3\">Bile microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile microscopy detects microcrystals of cholesterol or amorphous bilirubinate as indirect evidence for the presence of microlithiasis in the bile.

Because of the improved sensitivity of transabdominal ultrasonography for detection of small stones and sludge, there is less need for microcrystal analysis. However, it still has a role in category 4 patients with biliary colic without gallstones on transabdominal ultrasound. However, because obtaining a sample for bile microscopy during endoscopy can take over 45 minutes, we reserve the procedure for patients with a negative EUS. </p><p>The test is based upon the theory that patients with cholesterol microlithiasis have bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol and thus have cholesterol monohydrate crystals in their gallbladder bile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73479\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73479 \">picture 1</a>), while those with bilirubinate microlithiasis have amorphous reddish-brown bilirubinate granules in their gallbladders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80050\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80050 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, the methods for performing the test have not been well standardized, which has led to confusion regarding how to collect and process the bile samples for analysis and what constitutes a positive test.</p><p>The proportion of patients with suspected gallstones but negative transabdominal ultrasound found to have microlithiasis varies substantially among reports. A systematic review found that microcrystals accounted for 7 to 79 percent of cases of idiopathic pancreatitis, 83 percent of patients with unexplained biliary-type pain, and 25 to 60 percent of patients with altered biliary and pancreatic sphincter function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>While the presence of any cholesterol crystals is theoretically abnormal, to increase specificity, some of the newer reports presume the test to be positive only if more than three crystals are seen per high power field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, whether findings based upon this approach correlate with clinical outcomes has not been established. As a result, this presumption has not been widely accepted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64850136\"><span class=\"h4\">Bile collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most available studies describe the test as it pertains to the detection of microlithiasis in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis and have used variable techniques for bile collection, bile processing, and microscopic crystal analysis. Nevertheless, most investigators agree that crystals are formed in the gallbladder where bile is concentrated, so gallbladder bile rather than hepatic bile should be analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/28,44,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,44,52</a>]. Hepatic bile is significantly less concentrated and thus has a lower yield for the detection of microlithiasis.</p><p>Gallbladder bile can be collected using the following techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through direct percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, either through selective gallbladder cannulation or by aspirating bile from the common bile duct after stimulating gallbladder contraction with a slow intravenous infusion of the cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sincalide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sincalide</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During endoscopy by suctioning bile from the duodenum in the region of the ampulla after gallbladder stimulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sincalide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sincalide</a>. </p><p/><p>In most cases, collection during endoscopy is the simplest and most practical method. Since EUS includes an endoscopic examination, bile collection can be performed during the same session as an EUS, which increases the sensitivity for detecting gallstones over that of EUS alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H58361831\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p>Our approach in patients with biliary colic and a negative EUS is to collect a bile sample during the same endoscopic session as the EUS. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sincalide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sincalide</a> (0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight) is given by intravenous drip over 45 minutes; the longer infusion is safer and more effective than a short bolus technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The tip of the endoscope is positioned next to the ampulla and the bile is aspirated. Bile flow usually starts to accelerate within five minutes of the start of the sincalide infusion. The first 5 to 10 minutes of bile flow is normally light in color and represents common bile duct and hepatic bile. Gallbladder bile is the darker bile that starts flowing several minutes later. We use a commercially available bile collecting catheter with a mushroom tip that we introduce through the working channel of the endoscope and connect to an external suction trap. Once we start to observe dark gallbladder bile being suctioned into the collecting trap, we empty the light colored bile from the trap and begin collecting the dark bile sample. When about 10 to 20 mL of bile has been collected, we stop the Sincalide infusion and conclude the procedure. This typically takes about 30 to 45 minutes from the start of the sincalide infusion to accomplish.</p><p>The collected sample of dark bile is incubated at 37&deg;C for 24 hours and then centrifuged at 3000 G for 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The supernatant is discarded and the sediment is mixed into the liquid remaining at the bottom of the tube. A drop of that liquid is placed on a slide and examined using a polarizing microscope; a polarizing filter facilitates identification of cholesterol crystals, which exhibit birefringence (they shine against the dark background of the polarizing microscope). The test is considered positive if any cholesterol crystals or amorphous red-brick colored bilirubinate granules are seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997053\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests that are rarely done</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8997156\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral cholecystography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral cholecystography can diagnose gallstones and assess gallbladder function, but it has largely been replaced by more sensitive and specific tests, such as transabdominal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/33,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,55</a>].

Gallstones appear as filling defects within the contrast on plain radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79353\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79353 \">image 5</a>). Non-opacification of the gallbladder can occur due to poor absorption from the intestine, impaired liver function, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction.

The patient is given a fatty meal and serial radiographs are obtained. If the gallbladder is functioning normally, there will be a decrease in gallbladder size over time.

An episode of prolonged right upper quadrant pain (greater than four to six hours), especially if associated with fever, should arouse suspicion for acute cholecystitis as opposed to an attack of simple biliary colic.

While biliary colic is present in both uncomplicated gallstone disease and in acute cholecystitis, the pain in uncomplicated gallstone disease is entirely visceral in origin since the gallbladder wall is not inflamed. Thus, it is less well localized and patients do not exhibit a positive Murphy's sign on physical examination. A Murphy's sign is elicited by palpating the area of the gallbladder fossa just beneath the liver edge while the patient is asked to inspire deeply, causing the gallbladder to descend toward the examining fingers. Patients with acute cholecystitis commonly experience increased discomfort and may have an associated inspiratory arrest (a positive Murphy's sign).

On the other hand, patients with acute cholecystitis may have a leukocytosis and mild elevations in serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, and amylase. Transabdominal ultrasound findings that are not seen in patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease but that may be present with acute cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickening or edema and a &quot;sonographic Murphy's sign&quot; in which pain is reproduced when the gallbladder is compressed by the ultrasound probe under direct ultrasonic visualization. Cholescintigraphy (99mTc-heapto-iminodiacetic acid [HIDA] scanning) is not used in the diagnosis of gallstones, but is useful in excluding acute cholecystitis in patients who present with acute biliary colic.

However, the pain is usually more prolonged than is seen with uncomplicated gallstone disease. Serum aminotransferases are normal with uncomplicated gallstone disease but are typically elevated early in the course of biliary obstruction. If the stone is not passed, a cholestatic pattern may develop (increased bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase out of proportion to the elevation in the aminotransferases).

Pain control can usually be achieved with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Those with prolonged attacks (especially if accompanied by vomiting) should also receive intravenous hydration.</p><p>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> (30 to 60 mg adjusted for age and renal function given in a single intravenous or intramuscular dose) for patients who present to the emergency department with biliary colic. Treatment usually relieves symptoms within 10 to 30 minutes. Patients are then prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 400 mg orally for subsequent attacks that may occur while the patient is awaiting cholecystectomy. Patients who are managed as outpatients should be instructed to report to the emergency department if the pain does not resolve within four hours of the start of the pain because they are then at risk for developing complications such as acute cholecystitis. We reserve opioids for patients who have contraindications to NSAIDs or who do not achieve adequate pain relief with an NSAID. </p><p>The role for NSAIDs in the treatment of biliary colic was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials with 1076 patients that compared NSAIDs with no treatment, placebo, or other treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In addition, there was no difference in pain control between NSAIDs and opioids (RR 1.1; 95% CI 0.8-1.3). NSAIDs may also favorably alter the natural history of biliary colic, possibly due to the role of prostaglandins in the development of acute cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

It has traditionally been taught that meperidine is the narcotic of choice in patients with biliary colic or gallstone pancreatitis because it has less of an effect on sphincter of Oddi motility than morphine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>].

In addition, there are no clinical studies comparing meperidine and morphine, nor are there clinical studies to suggest that morphine causes pancreatitis or cholecystitis. Thus, there are insufficient data to suggest that morphine should be avoided in patients with biliary colic. In addition, morphine has the benefit of having a longer half-life than meperidine. Meperidine's short half-life may lead to the need for frequent dosing, resulting in the accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine, which causes neuromuscular irritation and, rarely, seizures. Finally, meperidine is associated with several drug interactions (for example, it is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors).</p><p>While anticholinergic agents are useful in the management of renal colic due to their smooth muscle relaxation effects, they do not appear to help biliary colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholecystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive prophylactic therapy to prevent future attacks of biliary colic and to prevent the complications of gallstone disease is appropriate for patients with typical biliary colic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F104170\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104170 \">algorithm 1</a>). Several modalities are available, ranging from cholecystectomy to medical dissolution of the stones. Cholecystectomy is recommended for the majority of patients, but medical dissolution therapy may be appropriate for patients who are poor surgical candidates or who refuse surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open cholecystectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones#H1099599667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical treatment of gallstones&quot;, section on 'Oral medical gallstone dissolution'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately a third of patients with a first episode of biliary colic will not develop a recurrence within two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, it is important to note that some patients may have unrecognized recurrent attacks if the initial attacks were not severe enough to lead to their seeking medical attention. While we still suggest cholecystectomy for patients with an isolated attack of biliary colic, for patients who wish to avoid surgery, expectant management or consideration of oral medical dissolution therapy may be a reasonable alternative provided that the patient understands the risk of subsequent complications developing. It is important that patients who do not undergo cholecystectomy be educated about the symptoms of biliary colic and be instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms develop. For patients who opt not to undergo surgery, oral dissolution therapy with bile acids is an option. Studies suggest that long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> therapy of 600 mg per day reduces the risk of biliary complications and the need for a cholecystectomy by 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

The importance of this is outlined in a study of 11,126 patients with symptomatic gallstones who presented to the emergency department and were discharged prior to having a cholecystectomy. Of those, only 48 percent saw a surgeon in follow-up (29 percent saw a physician other than a surgeon, and 23 percent did not see a physician) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Subsequent emergency hospitalization was required in 8 percent of those who saw a surgeon, 15 percent of those who saw a physician other than a surgeon, and 78 percent of those who did not see a physician in follow-up. Of the 57 percent of patients who had presented with biliary colic, 36 percent subsequently underwent elective cholecystectomy, and 17 percent required emergency cholecystectomy. Importantly, in the cohort overall, complications following cholecystectomy were more common in those who underwent emergency surgery compared with those who underwent elective surgery (41 versus 19 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64850949\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholecystectomy is typically performed laparoscopically, though it may also be performed through an open right upper quadrant incision. A laparoscopic approach eliminates the need to cut the rectus abdominis muscle and is associated with less postoperative pain, better cosmesis, shorter hospital stays, and less time off from work than open cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/69-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-73</a>]. However, the laparoscopic procedure has been associated with an increased risk of common bile duct injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. In addition, the laparoscopic procedure may require conversion to an open procedure due to a variety of technical or patient issues.

In a systematic review of 23 studies looking at the effect of cholecystectomy for patients with gallstones, 92 percent of patients with biliary colic had symptom relief following cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Factors that predict a response to cholecystectomy were evaluated in a study of 1008 patients with upper abdominal pain and gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Upper abdominal pain relief was reported by 594 patients (59 percent) following cholecystectomy. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with pain relief following cholecystectomy included pain that occurred once a month or less (odds ratio [OR] 1.6), pain that began one year or less prior to surgery (OR 1.3), and pain that awakened the patient at night (OR 1.5). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of achieving pain relief were the presence of lower abdominal pain (OR 0.7), usually having an abnormal bowel pattern (OR 0.6), and often feeling bloated or &quot;burpy&quot; (OR 0.6).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64850996\"><span class=\"h4\">Complications and side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major complications have been reported to occur in 2.6 percent of laparoscopic cholecystectomies and include bleeding, abscess formation, bile leak, biliary injury, and bowel injury.

Increased risks of right-sided colon cancer, esophageal cancer, and small intestinal cancer in patients who have undergone cholecystectomy have also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>]. This may be related to the effects of increased concentrations of the bile acid deoxycholic acid in the gut lumen as a result of loss of the gallbladder, which normally acts as a reservoir for concentrated bile acids.

Nonsurgical techniques for treatment of gallstones have been developed, including medical dissolution therapy with oral bile acids.

This suggests that in some patients, the atypical symptoms are related to the gallstones, but that in others they are due to another cause and the gallstones are an incidental finding. Thus, a careful search for other causes of a patient's atypical symptoms is indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F104170\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104170 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, symptoms as described by patients are highly subjective and often change. As a result, it is useful to review the symptoms on more than one occasion to see if a patient has developed biliary colic. (See <a href=\"#H58360586\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The probability of patients with atypical symptoms and gallstones responding to cholecystectomy was evaluated in a systematic review. Among patients with upper abdominal pain (but not necessarily biliary colic), the relief rates for elective and acute cholecystectomy were 72 and 86 percent, respectively. In patients with dyspeptic symptoms, the relief rates were 56 and 82 percent, respectively. In addition, 65 percent of patients with food intolerance reported relief after 12 months.</p><p>An empiric trial of oral dissolution therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) may help identify patients who will benefit from cholecystectomy, provided there has been a thorough evaluation for other causes of the symptoms. UDCA therapy relieves the symptoms in many patients within three months if the symptoms are due to gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. While UDCA therapy may provide symptomatic relief, the rates of complete stone dissolution are poor (37 percent in a meta-analysis), leaving patients at risk for complications from their gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. As a result, we refer patients who respond to UDCA for cholecystectomy if they are surgical candidates, especially if they are not interested in staying on UDCA for two to three years to see if their stones will dissolve. We do not suggest cholecystectomy in patients who fail to respond to UDCA, and instead treat for disorders more consistent with the patient's symptoms (eg, functional dyspepsia in a patient with bloating).

Biliary colic often presents with upper abdominal pain associated with diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications are rare in patients with asymptomatic gallstones, but are much more common once patients develop symptoms. Symptoms are usually mild initially. Once symptoms are present, complications develop at a rate of 2 to 3 percent per year. Once a complication occurs, subsequent and often more severe complications occur at a rate of 30 percent per year. Complications include acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis with obstruction (with or without acute cholangitis), and gallstone pancreatitis. Rare complications include gallbladder cancer, gallstone ileus, and Mirizzi syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H243183886\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, the evaluation of a patient with biliary colic begins with a transabdominal ultrasound. If the ultrasound is negative, additional studies that may help with the diagnosis include repeating the transabdominal ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, and bile microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease may have ultrasound findings of gallstones, gravel, or sludge. Distinguishing among these three entities is generally not clinically important because they are managed identically. On ultrasound, gallstones appear as echogenic foci that cast an acoustic shadow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70175\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70175 \">image 2</a>) and seek gravitational dependency. Gravel is the appearance of multiple small stones that are echogenic and cast shadows. Sludge, which represents cholesterol crystals and bilirubinate particles in a mucus glycoprotein gel, is echogenic in appearance but does not cast an acoustic shadow. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallstone disease is usually considered as part of the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with upper abdominal symptoms. Thus, the decision to implicate the gallbladder has to be made based upon clinical suspicion for a varied group of disorders that include peptic ulcer disease, nonulcer dyspepsia, functional gallbladder disorder, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, complications related to gallstones, such as acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, and acute cholangitis also need to be considered.

However, patients must be educated about the symptoms of gallstone disease so they can seek treatment before more severe symptoms or complications develop. On the other hand, cholecystectomy may be a reasonable alternative in patients at increased risk for complications or gallbladder cancer.

For patients who have had an isolated episode of biliary colic without complications and wish to avoid surgery, expectant management may be a reasonable alternative provided that the patient understands the risk of subsequent complications developing. It is important that patients who do not undergo cholecystectomy be educated about the symptoms of biliary colic and be instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms develop. Dissolution therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients who are not surgical candidates.

Such patients should be thoroughly evaluated for non-gallstone-related causes of their symptoms. Cholecystectomy is a reasonable alternative if a thorough evaluation for other causes of the patient's symptoms is negative and if the patient has a symptomatic response to dissolution therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a>.

If the evaluation for functional gallbladder disorder is negative, patients are generally treated for functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome.
