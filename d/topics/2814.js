Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-use-and-disorder-epidemiology-comorbidity-health-consequences-and-medico-legal-status/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The legal status of cannabis use, for medical as well as recreational purposes, varies internationally as well as across the United States. The potency of cannabis has increased significantly around the world in recent decades, which may have contributed to increased rates of cannabis-related adverse effects. Cannabis use disorder develops in approximately 10 percent of regular cannabis users, and may be associated with cognitive impairment, poor school or work performance, and psychiatric comorbidity such as mood disorders and psychosis. </p><p>The medico-legal context, epidemiology, comorbidity, and health consequences of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder in adults are reviewed here. The pathogenesis, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of cannabis use disorder are reviewed separately.
