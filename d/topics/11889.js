These included: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral medical dissolution with bile acids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous cholecystostomy with stone extraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous or transnasal topical solvent dissolution</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy</p><p/><p>Of these, only oral medical dissolution therapy and percutaneous cholecystostomy with stone extraction are viable therapeutic alternatives in a subset of patients. Topical solvent dissolution therapy for gallbladder stones is no longer used as it is labor intensive, costly, and requires a complex apparatus for safe solvent delivery that is not readily available. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has also fallen out of favor for similar reasons, but may be used in rare situations in association with oral medical dissolution therapy. Transnasal topical dissolution of common bile duct stones is still available but rarely used. It is practiced in cases of large cholesterol bile duct stones that are difficult to extract endoscopically.</p><p>The role of nonsurgical management of gallstone disease has decreased since the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which remains the preferred method because of its reduced cost, short recovery, relatively definitive nature, and safety track record [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. While the nonsurgical approaches are hypothetically safer, requiring no abdominal incision, no general anesthesia, and preserving the gallbladder, they all suffer from three inherent disadvantages, as they are labor intensive, some are mainly suited for primarily cholesterol stones, and recurrence can occur at a rate as high as 50 percent over five years. With the significant progress in general anesthesia and the advantages of laparoscopic over open cholecystectomy, nonsurgical treatment of gallbladder stones has been falling out of favor. Nevertheless, medical oral dissolution therapy, which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, may be an alternative to cholecystectomy in selected patients with symptomatic gallstone disease aiming at either eliminating the stones or reducing the risk of recurrent symptoms and further complications. Percutaneous cholecystostomy and stone extraction is another non-surgical, less invasive approach that is still offered in several centers for patients who are a prohibitive surgical and anesthesia risk.</p><p>This topic will mainly concentrate on oral dissolution therapy for the elective treatment of gallbladder stones, but will briefly review the other nonsurgical modalities. Endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones without subsequent cholecystectomy, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy are discussed separately.

Gallstones are composed of a mixture of cholesterol, calcium salts of bilirubinate or palmitate, proteins, and mucin. Patients with gallstones may have any one of three types of stones based on chemical composition. They are broadly classified as cholesterol, black pigment, or brown pigment stones, depending upon the predominant constituents, although most &quot;cholesterol&quot; stones have a mixed composition with small amounts of calcium, palmitate, and bilirubinate salts. The stone population in any patient is usually of homogeneous composition, and it is rare that any one patient would have different types of stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114842 \">picture 1</a>). Cholesterol stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114842 \">picture 1</a>) usually form in individuals with a genetic or environmental predisposition to bile that is supersaturated with cholesterol. In the Western world, they account for 75 percent of stones, which is why most medical therapies were developed for the management of cholesterol-rich gallstones. Black pigment stones result from hemolysis and consist primarily of calcium bilirubinate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114842 \">picture 1</a>). Brown pigment stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114842 \">picture 1</a>) are associated with bacterial infection, parasitic infestation of the biliary system, and are also often found in the bile ducts in association with prior biliary manipulation. They may also occur as de novo common bile duct stones following cholecystectomy. The prevalence of pigment stones is dependent primarily upon the frequency of hemolytic disorders in the community. In industrialized countries, cholesterol gallstones account for approximately 75 percent of stones, black pigment stones for 20 percent, and brown pigment stones for 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1099599667\"><span class=\"h1\">ORAL MEDICAL GALLSTONE DISSOLUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this modality, bile acids are administered orally, to be secreted by the liver into bile and concentrating in the gallbladder to shift the concentration balance of cholesterol in relationship to bile acids, reversing its supersaturation and leading to dissolution of the cholesterol crystals from the structure of cholesterol stones. This is a slow process that may take several years; thus, it is not suited for patients who are acutely symptomatic with severe symptoms. However, in most cases, recurrent uncomplicated biliary colic will subside within a few weeks of bile acid administration even though the stones are still present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>The success of bile acid dissolution therapy depends upon the size and composition of the gallstone(s), cystic duct patency, and gallbladder function (both contractile and absorptive). Small, cholesterol-rich stones without evidence of calcification and with low concentrations of bilirubin salts are the best candidates for bile acid therapy. Multiple small stones dissolve faster than a few larger stones due to their larger surface area that would be exposed to the bile acid. Occasionally, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was used to fracture the stones into small pieces and sand to increase the surface area that is exposed to the bile acids, facilitating dissolution and clearance of the stone(s). (See <a href=\"#H1158344479\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl)'</a> below.)</p><p>Fair to good gallbladder function is necessary for two reasons. First, a functioning gallbladder is able to contract and relax to allow the continued exchange of gallbladder bile with fresh, unsaturated hepatic bile containing the administered bile acid to mix with the stones and affect their dissolution. Secondly, the mucosa of the gallbladder has to be able to carry out its normal function of absorbing water to concentrate bile, which will also concentrate the administered bile acid within the gallbladder. This is essential in allowing the bile acid to dissolve the cholesterol in the stones. Needless to say, the cystic duct has to be patent to allow entry of the bile acid into the gallbladder in the first place. Thus, appropriate patient selection is of paramount importance, although even carefully selected patients have significant failure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. These characteristics can be determined noninvasively with a number of simple imaging tests that are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3565731258\"><span class=\"h2\">Bile acid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile acids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA), have been used in the treatment of cholesterol gallstones, though only UDCA is currently used because chenodeoxycholic acid is associated with a number of adverse side effects. Bile acids work by reducing biliary cholesterol secretion, increasing biliary bile acid concentrations, and as a result, reducing the cholesterol saturation index in bile. In addition, UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile flow, and improve gallbladder emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. Bile acids have also been shown to improve gallbladder muscle contractility and reduce gallbladder wall inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Together, all these properties of bile acids are expected to dissolve pure cholesterol stones. However, most gallstones have a mixed composition, containing varying amounts of calcium salts, which limits, to some extent, the efficacy of this form of therapy. Although, when the cholesterol portion of stones that have limited amounts of calcium salts dissolve, the remainder of the stones will disintegrate into sand that a functioning gallbladder can expel overtime, as long as bile acid administration continues for a period of time after the stones have dissolved to prevent cholesterol reaccumulation over the calcium salt nidus until all the sand has been expelled. Occasionally, rim calcification develops after chronic UDCA use, inhibiting further stone dissolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The primary aim of therapy is to achieve complete gallstone dissolution, but an equally important goal is to reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of complications. While the former may take a few years to accomplish, biliary colic attacks will seize and the patient will usually become asymptomatic on bile acid therapy within a few weeks in spite of the stones still being there [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/10,11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,21</a>]. The exact reason for this response is not clear, but it is thought that bile acids increase biliary water secretion and bile flow reducing viscosity and sludging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3175678974\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients selected for oral bile acid therapy should have the following favorable characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/10-12,14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,14,21,22</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4272107972\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small stone size (&lt;1 cm) determined by ultrasonography or an oral cholecystogram.

This can be determined by an oral cholecystogram. (See below.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal stone calcification and high cholesterol concentration as can be assessed using a limited non-contrast CT scan of the gallbladder to ascertain low CT density of the stones in Hounsfield units. Gallstone buoyancy demonstrated on an upright oral cholecystogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114838\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114838 \">image 1</a>) or on an ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114839\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114839 \">image 2</a>) or CT scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114841\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114841 \">image 3</a>) is an indication of high cholesterol content and very good response to bile acid dissolution.</p><p/><p>Good gallbladder motor function (ie, filling and emptying) is also theoretically desirable to ensure that bile that has become saturated with the dissolved cholesterol is regularly emptied out into the duodenum in exchange with fresh, bile acid rich bile delivered from the liver. It is also necessary to ensure that resultant gallstone debris are expelled to minimize stone recurrence. However, to assess gallbladder motor function, a stimulated HIDA scan, stimulated oral cholecystogram, or stimulated ultrasound with measurement of ejection, fraction is needed, which can lead to biliary colic in patients with gallbladder stones. Hence, we usually do not attempt to assess gallbladder motor function in patients with known gallstones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4272107972\"><span class=\"h4\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristics of the gallstones need to be considered before instituting medical therapy. This can usually be achieved by a plain abdominal X-ray, computed tomography (CT) combined with ultrasonography, oral cholecystography, or cholescintigraphy of the gallbladder. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain Abdominal X-ray (KUB) </strong>&mdash; A pain abdominal x-ray may show calcified gallstones in approximately only 10 percent of unselected patients with gallstones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71203\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71203 \">image 4</a>). Its low cost and simplicity make it a very attractive first test that can exclude patients who will not respond to dissolution therapy. However, a negative KUB does not necessarily predict response to dissolution therapy since amounts of calcium in stones that are not sufficient to show on a KUB can still render stones non-dissolvable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography </strong>&mdash; A limited noncontrast CT scan of only the region of the gallbladder is useful in evaluating whether stones that have been detected by other imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography, will respond to dissolution therapy. Stones with a high calcium bilirubinate and calcium palmitate content will not dissolve well as compared to pure cholesterol stones which dissolve relatively more rapidly. The usefulness of a CT scan in predicting stone dissolution with oral bile acids has been evaluated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Stones with an average CT density of more than 100 Hounsfield units dissolve poorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The pattern of calcification and morphologic appearance on CT imaging may also be predictive of dissolution success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Highly calcified stones and stones with dense surface calcification are unlikely to dissolve. Stones with a high concentration of cholesterol usually have an average CT image density of less than 100 Hounsfield units and are most susceptible to dissolution but only about 20 percent of patients have this type of stones. The majority of gallstones are not visualized on abdominal CT because they are isodense with bile. These stones have varying rates of response to dissolution, but assessing the CT density of bile in the gallbladder can help predict outcomes. Stones that appear as black holes within gallbladder bile, due to very low CT density of negative Hounsfield Units, have a high propensity for dissolution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114841\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114841 \">image 3</a>). Floating stones (gallstone buoyancy) demonstrated on a CT scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114841\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114841 \">image 3</a>) is an indication of high cholesterol content and excellent response to bile acid dissolution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &mdash; Ultrasound is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for detecting gallbladder stones. However, even with an experienced operator, it is difficult to determine the number or size of stones in the gallbladder with ultrasonography. This is especially true for very small stones (1 or 2 mm in diameter) that frequently, when present in large numbers, can appear on transabdominal ultrasound as one large stone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F97751\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97751 \">image 5</a>). Ultrasonography has been used to assess response to oral dissolution treatment. However, when used for this purpose, it is important to note that because most stones dissolve from inside out, stones do not appear to be decreasing in size on yearly follow-up exams before they disappear when the external shell disintegrates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H58360944\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Test characteristics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral cholecystography</strong> &mdash; While oral cholecystography is<strong> </strong>no longer used to establish the diagnosis of gallstones, it is useful in selecting patients for non-surgical treatment of gallstones especially for oral medical therapy by accurately assessing stone number and size, buoyancy (relative density of the stones to bile), cystic duct patency, and the gallbladder's concentrating ability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114838\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114838 \">image 1</a>). Buoyant stones on an upright radiograph tend to be cholesterol rich and have a 90 percent probability of complete dissolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The oral cholecystogram is performed as follows: After a regular evening meal, which is needed to empty the gallbladder at least to some extent, an orally administered contrast agent (eg, iopanoic acid, sodium tyropanoate, or calcium ipodate) is given. It is absorbed through the intestine, taken up by the liver, secreted into bile, and concentrated in the gallbladder. If all these steps were intact and take place overnight, and if the patient remains fasting, then an abdominal upright x-ray the next morning will show an outline of the gallbladder full of the concentrated contrast. Gallstones appear as filling defects within the contrast on the plain radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F114838\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114838 \">image 1</a>). Non-opacification of the gallbladder can occur due to poor absorption from the intestine, impaired liver function, fibrotic gallbladder mucosa not capable of concentrating, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. With available oral contrast agents, it is unlikely that the gallbladder will be visualized if the serum bilirubin is greater than 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An approximation of gallbladder motor function can also be obtained using oral cholecystography. The patient is given a fatty meal and serial radiographs are obtained. If the gallbladder is functioning normally, there will be a decrease in gallbladder size over time. Evaluation of the gallbladder motor function is not recommended in patients who have known gallbladder stones since it may induce biliary colic or complications of gallstone disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) </strong>&mdash; Cholescintigraphy using 99mTc-hepatic iminodiacetic acid (generically referred to as a HIDA scan) is indicated to assess cystic duct patency if an oral cholecystogram is not available. The HIDA scan is not useful in elucidating mucosal concentrating function, as it is too sensitive and will visualize the gallbladder without the need for concentration. A stimulated HIDA scan with cholecystokinin should not be performed in patients with gallbladder stones as a forceful gallbladder contraction may lead to an attack of biliary colic or other complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)'</a>.)</p><p/><p><strong> &#160;Choice of bile acid</strong> &mdash; Early studies showed that 40 to 60 percent of carefully selected patients treated with 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a> cleared their gallstones after 12 to 24 months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, dose-related diarrhea is seen in approximately 50 percent of patients and a substantial proportion of patients develop hypercholesterolemia and increased serum aminotransferases significantly limiting the acceptability of chenodeoxycholic acid monotherapy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) has significantly fewer side effects than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a>, causes less diarrhea, does not increase serum cholesterol, and has no hepatotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Hence, it is the bile acid typically chosen for dissolution therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The only drawback to UDCA is its cost, but generic alternatives are now available.</p><p>Combining these two agents using lower doses of each has been used to offset the side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a> and the high cost of UDCA. Some studies suggest that this combination may be superior to the use of either agent alone, but others have not confirmed these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>], and, as a result, this approach is not generally used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1375116986\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and rate of dissolution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UDCA is typically given at a dose of 10 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It is suggested that bile acids be given at bedtime to maintain hepatic bile acid secretion overnight. This reduces secretion of supersaturated bile and increases stone dissolution rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The rate of gallstone dissolution in patients taking UDCA at a standard dose is approximately 1 mm per month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3751132890\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of oral dissolution therapy correlate with the size and composition of the gallstones and the rigor with which the patients have been selected. Studies using strict inclusion criteria have found dissolution rates of between 50 to 60 percent, and a meta-analysis found a 37 percent dissolution rate with UDCA, with the best results occurring in patients with small buoyant stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, studies show that symptomatic patients who are not candidates for cholecystectomy appear to benefit from long-term UDCA with lower rates of biliary symptoms and reduced rates of cholecystectomy irrespective of whether the stones completely dissolve or not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>If only ideal patients are selected (those with small, noncalcified, buoyant stones in a functioning gallbladder), dissolution rates may exceed 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Unfortunately, less than 10 percent of patients fall into this category. The response to treatment is slow, with gallstone size falling by only 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/month</span> on average. Thus, treatment may be required for two years or more. However, in most cases, symptoms will subside after a few weeks of UDCA therapy, even though it may take a few years for the stones to completely dissolve. This is believed to be due to the reduction in biliary viscosity as a result of the choleretic effects of UDCA.</p><p>Incomplete dissolution remains a significant problem. This has been attributed to insoluble components of the gallstones as well as a process referred to as &quot;rim calcification,&quot; in which calcium is laid down upon the surface of the stone. Rim calcification has been reported in 10 to 12 percent of patients treated with bile acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/20,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,41</a>]. Rim calcification was initially thought to be associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> therapy, but it has also been found using other bile salts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. High calcium content of the stone may facilitate rim calcification. Careful selection of non-calcium-containing stones using CT scan may prevent some of these therapeutic failures. As expected, patients with low-density stones on a CT scan (&lt;75 Hounsfield units) respond more rapidly and completely to oral bile acid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>However, several studies have suggested that treatment with bile acids prevents gallstone-related symptoms, even in patients in whom gallstone dissolution is incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/21,31,36,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31,36,42</a>]. This observation was supported by a cohort study that included 527 patients with gallstones who were followed for up to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The patients received UDCA (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or no specific treatment based upon their preference. Multivariate analysis showed that UDCA was associated with a significantly reduced risk of gallstone-related symptoms at up to 10 years of follow-up (62 versus 92 percent in those with a history of gallstone-related symptoms, and 6 versus 12 percent in those without a prior history of symptoms). This benefit was independent of stone dissolution. Although this study is limited by its nonrandomized design, it suggests a potential benefit of long-term bile acid therapy in symptomatic patients in whom cholecystectomy is undesirable, even if complete gallstone dissolution cannot be accomplished. Even though randomized trials in this area are lacking, many centers, including ours, do use bile acid therapy in this fashion.</p><p>On the other hand, a short course of therapy may not be of benefit. This issue arises in regions where there is a long waiting time between the diagnosis of gallstone disease and subsequent cholecystectomy such as in the case of inadequate resources. The role of UDCA in this setting was evaluated in a trial of 177 symptomatic patients with gallstones who were randomly assigned to UDCA or placebo while awaiting cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. No significant difference was observed in the proportion of patients with gallstone-related symptoms during an average follow-up of approximately 90 days. While the study may have been too small to detect a difference, it suggests that a benefit of UDCA in preventing gallstone symptoms in the short-term is small at best.</p><p>To enhance the efficacy of UDCA therapy and shorten the duration of dissolution, two supplementary techniques have been studied. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was used to fracture the stones into rubble, which presents a larger surface area, increasing the rate of dissolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. However, subsequent studies failed to show this approach to be clinically significantly better than UDCA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Stirring is known to enhance the dissolution of solids in liquids, on the basis of which a vibrating belt system is being developed, which a gallstone patient can wear several hours a day to vibrate the gallbladder and stir its contents. Studies are underway in Europe to evaluate this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2848971862\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been interest in the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in the treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. These agents reduce biliary cholesterol secretion, providing the rationale for their use in gallstone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Several studies have shown that statins reduce the cholesterol saturation index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. Two studies from the United States and United Kingdom suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with a modest reduction in the need for cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest that statins lead to gallstone dissolution or prevent the formation of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/49,55-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,55-61</a>], whereas others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>]. Combining statins with bile acids has also been studied with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/63,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,67</a>]. As an example, in a randomized controlled trial, 50 patients with radiolucent gallstones were treated with UDCA (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or UDCA (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. At the end of the study, significantly more patients with multiple gallstones who received simvastatin and UDCA achieved dissolution compared with those who received UDCA alone (71 versus 25 percent). However, combined therapy was not significantly better than UDCA alone in patients who had single gallstones. Based upon the available limited data, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of statins for the treatment or prevention of gallstones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4198018534\"><span class=\"h2\">Ezetimibe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ezetimibe</a> is a hypocholesterolemic drug that acts by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption. Animal models suggest that it may be effective for the treatment or prevention of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. It lowers biliary cholesterol secretion but does not decrease the bile salt content in bile. In humans it has been shown to reduce the cholesterol saturation index of bile and retard cholesterol crystallization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Trials are needed in humans to determine if it is effective for gallstone prevention or dissolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343442799\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoterpenes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rowachol, an orally administered mixture of cyclic monoterpenes, has been used in several studies for the dissolution of gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. This agent is capable of dissolving radiolucent and some radio-opaque gallstones. Furthermore, it also enhanced the efficacy of UDCA or lithotripsy when these modalities were used in combination. However, the added benefit is modest, and these agents are not widely used, although they are available through alternative medicine outlets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4144592426\"><span class=\"h1\">TOPICAL CONTACT DISSOLUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact dissolution of gallstones with solvents instilled directly into the gallbladder or bile duct was another approach to treating gallstones without surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p><strong>Gallbladder Stones </strong>&mdash; For gallbladder stones, a small (typically 7 French size) percutaneous catheter is inserted into the gallbladder under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>], through which a chemical liquid solvent is instilled and stirred into the gallbladder around the stones either manually with hand syringing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>] or automatically with a computerized solvent transfer system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>], which dissolves them in a few hours while preserving the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The initial solvent used was methyl tert-butyl ether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/72,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,76</a>], but subsequently the food additive ethyl propionate was advocated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>]. Neither is currently United States Food and Drug Administration approved for this purpose. While results with this technique were good, with up to 98 percent of patients with radiolucent stones achieving complete stone dissolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], the procedure is no longer used as it is labor intensive, costly, and requires a complex apparatus for safe solvent delivery that is not readily available since it generated no commercial interest after the emergence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and advanced very safe general anesthesia practices. </p><p><strong>Common Bile Duct Stones </strong>&mdash; Monooctanoin is a solvent approved for the dissolution of bile duct stones by slow infusion over many hours through an endoscopically placed nasobiliary catheter, a percutaneously placed catheter, or a surgically placed T-tube into the common bile duct to dissolve large common bile duct stones that are not amenable to endoscopic removal techniques. Typically, when endoscopic removal of a large common bile duct stone(s) fails, a nasobiliary catheter is placed endoscopically into the bile duct with its pigtail above the stone(s), and monooctanoin diluted by 10 percent water is infused at a rate of about 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> to bathe the stones and flow into the duodenum. The catheter is placed concentrically past the stone to create a path for the solvent to drain around the stone from the proximal bile duct into the duodenum. During infusions, flow pressure is monitored using an inline liquid manometer similar to an old fashion central venous pressure line. Infusion rate must be adjusted for each individual patient so that common bile duct pressure, which is indirectly estimated based on the infusion pressure, will not rise above 12 cm of monooctanoin fluid pressure in order to avoid generating high biliary ductular pressures that may lead to back flow into the liver and hepatic sinusoidal spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The solvent is viscous and hence cannot be stirred, leading to prolonged dissolution times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Although it is still available, it is rarely used given advanced endoscopic stone extraction instruments and techniques. It is, however, useful in patients who are at prohibitive surgical risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380755204\"><span class=\"h1\">PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY AND GALLSTONE EXTRACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute gallstone-related disease who are not surgical candidates may require percutaneous cholecystostomy, which, in combination with antibiotic therapy, is very effective in resolving the acute gallbladder inflammation until the patient is made stable enough to undergo surgery or a nonsurgical technique if still not a surgical candidate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. One such procedure is that of percutaneous extraction of stones, where, after two or more weeks during which a percutaneous track into the gallbladder is allowed to form, the track is dilated under fluoroscopic guidance using graded percutaneous dilators followed by basked extraction of the stones and irrigation of the debris to the outside using saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Percutaneous cholecystoscopy has been used to monitor and aid this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/82,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,88</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1666503493\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPIC PLACEMENT OF A CYSTIC DUCT STENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case series have also described placement of a cystic duct stent during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with gallstone-related disease (such as biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and gallstone pancreatitis) and serious comorbidities that precluded other approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/89-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-94</a>]. Although placement of such stents may be technically challenging, they can provide sufficient palliation until more definitive therapy can be performed. No comparative data exists, but since this approach requires an ERCP with all its inherent risks, it is unclear if this procedure is safer than the percutaneous cholecystostomy. <br/><br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1158344479\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCK WAVE LITHOTRIPSY (ESWL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With this technique, shock waves generated outside the body are focused on the gallstones, using acoustic reflectors, to fracture them and reduce them to sand, which is then expected to be ejected into the duodenum through the biliary system or to be dissolved more readily by oral bile acids or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/26,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,95</a>]. While this technique has been very successful in managing renal stones, its success in treating gallbladder stones has been very limited due to its applicability to only a very select group of patients, its high cost, low efficacy, and the high rate of side effects including biliary colic attacks that ensue as the generated stone fragments start passing through the biliary system into the duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In addition, comparative studies have found that ESWL in combination with oral bile acids is not significantly superior to oral bile acid therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1190030602\"><span class=\"h1\">GALLSTONE RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the gallbladder is left behind and nothing is done to alter the metabolic disorder that led to the stones in the first place, gallstone recurrence is theoretically expected in all patients after nonsurgical treatment of gallstones. However, in many patients, whatever imbalance or disorder that had led to the gallstones initially may not be present anymore, which is why many patients will not have recurrent stones after successful dissolution. Approximately 15 percent of patients will recur by one year, and 45 percent will recur by five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/97-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-102</a>]. However, recurrent stones are usually asymptomatic and appear to follow the natural history of asymptomatic stones. In the case of oral bile acid therapy, the risk of recurrence appears to be highest in those with multiple stones and in whom the time to complete dissolution was longest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The rate of gallstone recurrence after the other modalities has not been well-studied but it appears to be high after ESWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonsurgical-treatment-of-gallstones/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

The two main methods for the nonsurgical management of selected patients with gallstone disease are oral bile salt therapy and percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by manual gallstone extraction. (See <a href=\"#H3640824757\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3175678974\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristics of the gallstones need to be considered before instituting medical therapy. This can usually be achieved by computed tomography combined with ultrasonography and oral cholecystography of the gallbladder. (See <a href=\"#H4272107972\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic gallstones in select patients may be treated with medical therapy alone. The main form of medical therapy is the orally administered bile acid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA), which may lead to gallstone dissolution and reduce symptoms in patients with mild symptoms or those who are not candidates for cholecystectomy. Other forms of nonsurgical therapy are rarely used. (See <a href=\"#H3565731258\" class=\"local\">'Bile acid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest dissolution therapy with UDCA in patients with mild symptoms who have non-calcified small stone(s) in a functioning gallbladder and are not candidates for cholecystectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Treatment should be continued until six months or longer after ultrasonography demonstrates clearance of the gallstones. In successfully treated patients, long-term therapy may be considered to minimize stone recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H3175678974\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3565731258\" class=\"local\">'Bile acid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The success of these techniques varies from 40 to 90 percent depending upon patient compliance, the stone characteristics, gallbladder function, and the experience of the center. Gallstone recurrence remains a significant problem, although only a small proportion of patients develop recurrent symptoms, at least in the short-term. Long-term bile acid therapy should be considered in patients who would not tolerate complicated stone recurrence and who are not surgical candidates.
