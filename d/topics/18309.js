Functional dyspepsia often comes back over time. It can develop because of an underlying medical problem. However, doctors are not able to find a cause for functional dyspepsia in most people.</p><p>This article discusses the symptoms, testing, and treatment options for people with functional dyspepsia. Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about dyspepsia is available by subscription.

However, researchers have focused on several factors that may be involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor or nerve problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of digesting food involves a series of events involving the nerves and muscles of the digestive tract. Problems in this system can cause the stomach to empty more slowly than normal, causing nausea and vomiting, feeling full quickly when eating, or bloating. However, not everyone whose stomach empties slowly has functional dyspepsia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stomach normally stretches as we eat to hold more food. However, some people are sensitive to this stretching and feel pain. It is not clear why this happens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Helicobacter pylori </em>(<em>H. pylori</em>) is a bacterial infection of the stomach that can lead to inflammation (gastritis) or ulcers. There may be a relationship between infection with <em>H. pylori</em> and functional dyspepsia. However, not all people with <em>H. pylori</em> have functional dyspepsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Helicobacter pylori infection and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Functional dyspepsia occasionally begins with acute gastroenteritis, usually due to a bacterial or viral infection. Dyspepsia can persist long after the infection subsides, perhaps caused by a change in the bacteria that normally lives in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological and social factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with functional dyspepsia often have mood problems, like anxiety or depression. Treating the underlying depression or anxiety can improve symptoms of abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help figure out the cause of your symptoms, your doctor or nurse will ask you questions and perform a physical exam. Questions to think about before your visit include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain &quot;gnawing&quot; or worse when you are hungry?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain worse when you move in certain ways or press on certain areas of the abdomen?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you take medicines for pain, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve)? Do you have a history of ulcers?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you also have heartburn?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have intense pain in the upper right or middle of the abdomen? Does the pain shoot into your back or between the shoulder blades? Does this happen periodically, along with vomiting, sweating, or feeling restless?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have there been changes in your bowel movements (new constipation or diarrhea)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you recently unintentionally lost weight, vomited repeatedly, or had difficulty swallowing?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to diagnose functional dyspepsia is not clear. Some experts recommend the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are 60 or older or have serious symptoms, such as repeated vomiting, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing, you might need an upper endoscopy procedure. This is a test that allows your doctor to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are younger than 60 or you do not have serious symptoms, you might be offered other types of testing. This might include a breath, blood, or stool test for <em>H. pylori</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Helicobacter pylori infection and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>If your symptoms do not get better within four to eight weeks or if you get worse, your doctor or nurse might recommend further testing, including upper endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Understand the condition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Being diagnosed with functional dyspepsia might be a relief to some people and a frustration to others. It is important to understand that your pain is not in your head. If you have questions or concerns about your symptoms or treatments that are offered, talk to your doctor or nurse honestly.</p><p>If you have mood problems, such as anxiety or depression, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you see a mental health specialist (eg, social worker, psychologist, counselor). Dealing with emotional issues can help you to feel better, both physically and mentally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people feel less pain after making changes in what they eat. This might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding fatty foods (which can slow the emptying of the stomach).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating small, frequent meals. Instead of three large meals, eat five or six small meals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding foods that make you feel worse. However, do not stop eating whole food groups unless you talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p>If you have questions about what you should eat, talk to your doctor, nurse, or a dietitian.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid-reducing medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people feel better after taking a medicine that reduces stomach acid. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more likely than other types of acid reducers to improve pain. Example of PPIs include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), and rabeprazole (AcipHex).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine blockers do not work as well as PPIs but might help some people. Examples include ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), and nizatidine (Axid).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antacids are not usually helpful for people with functional dyspepsia. Examples of antacids include Tums, Maalox, and Mylanta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">H. pylori treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are diagnosed with <em>H. pylori</em> and you have a stomach ulcer, treating the <em>H. pylori</em> can help to reduce symptoms of dyspepsia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Helicobacter pylori infection and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you test positive for <em>H. pylori</em> but you do not have a stomach ulcer, talk to your doctor or nurse to see if you should be treated. In this case, treating <em>H. pylori</em> usually does not help to reduce symptoms of indigestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low doses of an antidepressant medicine might help to reduce symptoms, even if you are not depressed. One of the most commonly used antidepressants is called a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is not clear how TCAs work, but they seem to improve pain when taken at low doses. The dose of TCAs used to treat pain is usually much lower than that used to treat depression.</p><p>TCAs commonly used for pain include amitriptyline and desipramine. In the beginning, many people who take TCAs feel tired; this is not always an undesirable side effect since it can help improve sleep when TCAs are taken in the evening. TCAs are generally started in low doses and increased gradually. It can take a few weeks to begin feeling better.</p><p>Nonprescription pain medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) are not usually helpful and can actually worsen stomach upset.</p><p>Prescription pain medicines, such as codeine, hydrocodone, or oxycodone, are not usually recommended long-term. These medicines have side effects (constipation) and are addictive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary and alternative medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several complementary and alternative medicine treatments are advertised to improve functional dyspepsia. Examples include treatments that include peppermint and caraway. However, there are no well performed medical studies of these treatments, so it is not clear if they are safe or if they work.
