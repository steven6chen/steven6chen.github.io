It is different from &quot;aphasia,&quot; which can cause difficulty in finding the right words to say or to understand what is being said. People who have dysarthria but do not have aphasia can understand language; they just can't form words clearly. Sometimes, people have both aphasia and dysarthria.</p><p>People with dysarthria might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slur their speech and sound as though they are drunk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speak very softly or in a whisper</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speak too quickly or too slowly, or mumble</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sound hoarse, nasal, or breathy when they talk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drool or have trouble controlling their saliva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble chewing or swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find that their face droops to 1 side</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6590964\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes dysarthria?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysarthria is usually caused by a disease or an injury that damages the brain or the body's nerves or muscles. For example, dysarthria can happen because of these conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parkinson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as &quot;ALS&quot; or Lou Gehrig's disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sclerosis (sometimes called &quot;MS&quot;)</p><p/><p>Some medicines, including medicines that make people sleepy, can also cause dysarthria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6590979\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you develop a new problem with speaking, your doctor or nurse will want to do an exam and learn about your problem. He or she will want to know what medicines you take and what else was happening when your problem started.</p><p>It's also possible you will need 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI or CT scan &ndash; These are imaging tests that create pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors can use them to check for problems in the brain or in the nerves and muscles that control speech.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (also called &quot;EMG&quot;) or nerve conduction studies (also called &quot;NCS&quot;) &ndash; These tests check how well nerves and muscles are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6590994\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I regain my ability to speak?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the cause of your dysarthria. If your dysarthria was caused by a stroke, you might be able to speak normally again one day. But if your dysarthria was caused by a nerve or muscle disorder that gets worse over time, it is less likely you will be able to speak normally again. Still, people with dysarthria can often learn new ways to communicate. For instance, they can learn to use alphabet boards to spell out the words they want to say. Plus, new technologies are being developed that use computers to help people speak.</p><p>If you develop dysarthria, you will probably need to work with a speech and language therapist. He or she can give you exercises to do to improve the way you speak. If you have problems swallowing, the therapist can also help you learn about things that can improve your swallowing. For instance, he or she might recommend that you eat and drink only things that are thick and have few chunks. That way you are less likely to choke or have foods go down the wrong way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6591009\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aphasia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Aphasia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysphagia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysphagia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=recovery-after-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Recovery after stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parkinson-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Parkinson disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=myasthenia-gravis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Myasthenia gravis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
