According to the 2013 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) report, the adjusted 60-month survival probabilities measured from day 1 of therapy for all patients was 0.30 for the cohort starting in 1998 compared with 0.36 for the cohort starting in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Previously, one partial explanation for the poor survival in the United States was inadequate dialysis since substantially higher survival rates have been reported in Europe and Japan, even after case adjustment for age, sex, and renal diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Japanese patients, for example, have far fewer comorbid risk factors than those in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, it is more likely that factors such as older age, a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, more comorbid conditions, and an inability to accurately capture severity of any noted comorbid disease are components of the higher dialysis mortality in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This is particularly true as an increasing dialysis dose has been realized in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>One of the highest survival rates has been reported from Tassin, France, where patients are dialyzed 24 hours per week, much longer than in almost all other centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53811 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This and other observations have led to a general increase in time in the dialysis prescription in the United States.</p><p>In addition to increased duration of dialysis, it has been proposed that other factors also may improve patient outcome such as frequency of the dialysis treatment and middle-molecule clearance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the selection of dialysis modality and patient outcomes that are associated with specific modalities. Patient outcomes associated with dialysis adequacy, the use of daily or nocturnal hemodialysis, and the selection of different types of peritoneal dialysis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolonged-intermittent-renal-replacement-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF DIALYSIS MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis modalities include hemodialysis, either in a dialysis center or at home, or peritoneal dialysis, including chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). In Europe, some patients are treated with hemofiltration technologies.</p><p>The selection of dialysis modality is influenced by a number of clinical and socioeconomic consideration, such as availability and convenience, comorbid conditions, dialysis-center factors, the patient's home situation, clinician comfort with home therapies, the method of clinician reimbursement, and the ability to tolerate volume shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].</p><p>At times, patients are not given unbiased information about their choices. Predialysis education regarding different modalities may increase the patient selection of peritoneal dialysis. In a systematic review and meta-analysis that included four observational studies (n = 7653), structured, patient-targeted educational interventions were associated with a twofold increase in the odds of choosing peritoneal dialysis compared with standard care (pooled odds ratio [OR] 2.15, 95% CI 1.07-4.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the single randomized trial included in the meta-analysis, the odds of choosing peritoneal dialysis was fourfold higher among patients who had received an educational intervention (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.19-17.74). Analysis of nine observational studies suggested that education was also associated with an increase in the odds of the patient receiving peritoneal dialysis, at least as an initial modality (3.50, 95% CI 2.82-4.35). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies due in part to differences in study populations and in interventions. Many of the included studies did not include adequate description of a control intervention.</p><p>In 2011, reimbursement in the United States changed to a bundled payment that removed unintended financial payment incentives, favoring center hemodialysis, and replaced them with a system that provided equal pay for both modalities (peritoneal dialysis and center hemodialysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Since that change in reimbursement, utilization of peritoneal dialysis in the 10 largest dialysis providers in the United States increased from 8.5 to 11.2 percent between 2010 and 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Patients who are selected for peritoneal dialysis may have fewer comorbidities compared with those who undergo hemodialysis. This was best shown in the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD (CHOICE) cohort study in which the baseline characteristics of 279 and 759 incident peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients, respectively, were assessed using the index of coexistent diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Comorbidity was significantly less severe among peritoneal dialysis patients, with the OR of choosing peritoneal dialysis being much less for those with the most severe coexistent conditions (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.90).</p><p>Other studies that have examined this issue have yielded conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. However, many of these reports, particularly those in the United States, were flawed because comorbidity was commonly assessed among prevalent (and not incident) patients and was principally defined as the relative contributions from age, diabetes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the underlying cause of renal disease.</p><p>Reimbursement strategies favor using one modality at a time. However, among some patients, it may be optimal to utilize both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in a way that provides the advantages of each modality but without the disadvantages. This is seldom done in the United States but is not uncommon in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. An example would be to do peritoneal dialysis five or six days a week and hemodialysis on the one or two off days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Another strategy, for example, may be an integrated-care approach in which incident dialysis patients initially undergo peritoneal dialysis, with transfer to hemodialysis once complications ensue with peritoneal dialysis. This is based in part on the hypothesis that, principally via its ability to preserve residual renal function, peritoneal dialysis provides significant benefits as an initial modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Other benefits may include preservation of vascular access and, perhaps, better survival during the first few years of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/1,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal dialysis versus in-center hemodialysis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVIVAL BY MODALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, in 2009, approximately 94 percent of prevalent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients were treated with in-center hemodialysis and 6 percent with peritoneal dialysis, which is a different modality distribution from that observed in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The ideal method to compare survival on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis is a prospective study that randomly assigned patients to peritoneal dialysis or in-center hemodialysis. Although such trials have been attempted, none have been completed in a way that provides conclusive answers. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. One such a study was initiated in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, among 738 patients who were eligible to participate, only 38 agreed to be randomly assigned. Because of the small number of enrolled patients and of deaths (nine and five with hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively), no significant survival data could be derived from this trial. Unfortunately, this study suggests that an appropriately powered trial to answer this important question will be extremely difficult to perform.</p><p>Many observational studies have attempted to compare outcomes among patients on in-center hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis. Our opinion is that, for most patients dialyzing at a center that is equally qualified to provide both in-center hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the expected outcomes for either modality would be similar. The following is an overview of some of the relative survival data related to the different available chronic dialysis modalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal dialysis versus in-center hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported first-year mortality rate for peritoneal dialysis patients in the United States is 6 to 12.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. A large number of studies, practically all retrospective and observational, have been performed concerning the relative effect upon mortality of peritoneal dialysis versus in-center hemodialysis. The results have been conflicting, with hemodialysis reportedly having no difference, a relative benefit, or a relative adverse effect upon survival compared with peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/33-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-42</a>]. Reasons for these variable results include selection bias, flawed study design, differences in mortality effects with time from initiation of dialysis, differences in comorbid diseases, and other factors.</p><p>Multiple studies have found that peritoneal dialysis may provide relative short-term survival benefits but comparable or decreased survival after one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/43-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intention-to-treat analysis of 35,265 Canadian patients who initiated dialysis between 1991 and 2004 demonstrated better survival associated with peritoneal dialysis for the first 18 months and with hemodialysis after 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Analysis of patients who started dialysis between 2001 and 2004 showed better survival with peritoneal dialysis for two years and comparable survival thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study from the Canadian registry using an &quot;as-treated&quot; analysis (in which treatment modality switches were incorporated) found that continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(CAPD)/continuous</span> cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), compared with hemodialysis, was associated with a significantly lower risk of death (relative risk [RR] of 0.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Most of the survival benefit was observed during the first two years after the initiation of renal replacement therapy. By comparison, the survival benefit of peritoneal dialysis largely disappeared (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.93) with an &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; analysis (in which treatments were classified based upon modality 90 days post-initiation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An advantage in short-term, but not long-term, survival with <span class=\"nowrap\">CAPD/CCPD</span> was also noted in a study of incident patients in the United States (99,048 hemodialysis and 18,110 <span class=\"nowrap\">CAPD/CCPD</span> patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Compared with patients undergoing hemodialysis, Cox regression analysis found that the RR of death for <span class=\"nowrap\">CAPD/CCPD</span> in nondiabetic and diabetic patients was 0.62 and 0.73 at three months, respectively; however, there was no significant difference in risk at two years.</p><p/><p>Analysis of data provided by the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) in the 2009 report suggested a survival benefit associated with peritoneal dialysis during the first few years on dialysis but which was lost over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Patients on peritoneal dialysis had a slight overall survival advantage compared with those on hemodialysis during the first three years of therapy, but, at five years, survival was equal, at 34 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83660 \">figure 2</a>). The 2016 report from the USRDS showed further improvement in peritoneal dialysis survival. Patients who started dialysis in 2009 had a 41.5 percent adjusted 60-month survival on hemodialysis compared with a 51.4 percent 60-month survival on peritoneal dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F115217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115217 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>These observations are not confined to the United States. There are similar trends in review of data from Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], Northern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47</a>], and from Australia and New Zealand (ANZDATA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>However, a large study of Korean patients showed improved survival among hemodialysis patients compared with peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This was a matched cohort study that included 32,280 incident dialysis patients who were followed for a median of 26.5 months. After propensity-score matching and after censoring for KT, mortality was higher for peritoneal dialysis patients compared with hemodialysis patients over the entire duration of dialysis therapy (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.28). Age was an important determinant of mortality differences between groups: Among patients &ge;55 years, mortality was higher among peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis patients, except among patients with malignancy. However, among patients &lt;55 years, mortality was the same between groups.</p><p>Suggested reasons for the disparity between results of this study and studies of Western countries include differences between countries in the quality of dialysis modality or in patient population characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It is possible that results of studies of Western populations may not apply to Asian patients.</p><p>In studies that have shown an early survival benefit associated with peritoneal dialysis, the time after dialysis initiation at which the relative survival benefit is lost and survival comparisons start to favor hemodialysis depends on multiple variables, including the cause of ESRD, vintage (ie, the year the patient started renal replacement therapy), gender, country of treatment, and presence or absence of comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. As an example, the survival advantage conferred by peritoneal dialysis is not as robust if the primary case of ESRD is diabetes, the patient is older, or the patient has comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/47,48,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48,56-59</a>]. In one study that analyzed data from 398,940 patients who initiated dialysis between the years 1995 to 2000, mortality risk was higher with hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis among those who had no baseline comorbidity (with RRs of 1.24, 1.13, and 1.13 among those between 18 to 44, 45 to 64, and older than 65 years, respectively) and among younger diabetics with no comorbidity (RR 1.22, for age between 18 and 44 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. By comparison, hemodialysis was associated with a lower mortality risk in older diabetics with either no comorbidity (RR 0.92 and 0.86 for ages 45 to 64 and greater than 65 years, respectively) or a baseline comorbidity (RR 0.82 and 0.80 for ages 45 to 64 and greater than 65 years, respectively).</p><p>The presence of heart failure may also attenuate the early survival benefit associated with peritoneal dialysis. Although one study found one- and two-year survivals of 90 and 64 percent among peritoneal dialysis patients with severe systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], a subsequent study found poorer survival among new dialysis patients with heart failure who were initially treated with peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>One of the major limitations of these epidemiologic studies is that there is an age by modality interaction. In particular, the risk of death with modality varies with age, with peritoneal dialysis having a relatively increased and decreased mortality in older and younger patients, respectively. Overall, it appears that the variable results are due to differences among incident patients and the type of analytical method utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Matched cohort studies have attempted to address some of these shortcomings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/48,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,61,62</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study (Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD [CHOICE]) compared the risk of death among 1041 patients starting dialysis (274 and 767 receiving peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively) who were followed for up to seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After statistical adjustment, the risk of death at one year from dialysis initiation was similar with both modalities. In the second year, however, the risk of death was significantly higher with peritoneal dialysis (HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.19-4.59). This result was consistently observed with different statistical models including a propensity score model. With subgroup analysis, a higher risk of death with peritoneal dialysis was observed in patients with cardiovascular disease and those with an intermediate propensity score of being initially treated with peritoneal dialysis. Unlike other studies, an increased risk for death with peritoneal dialysis was not observed among patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease or older patients. However, the overall mortality was relatively low for hemodialysis patients, suggesting that the cohort may not be representative of the US as a whole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective cohort study analyzed 6337 matched patient pairs who initiated dialysis in the United States during 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In an intention-to-treat analysis, compared with hemodialysis patients, cumulative survival was higher for peritoneal dialysis patients (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-1.00).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cumulative survival probabilities for peritoneal versus hemodialysis were 85.8 versus 80.7 percent, 71.1 versus 68 percent, 58.1 versus 56.7 percent, and 48.4 percent versus 47.3 percent at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. The survival advantage for peritoneal dialysis was most robust in patients less than 65 years old, those with no cardiovascular disease, and those without diabetes. If the observation was started at day 90, there was no difference between the modalities overall, but hemodialysis was associated with improved survival in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 27,015 patients from Australia and New Zealand, compared with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis was associated with a higher survival from day 90 to day 365 (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These benefits were most significant among younger patients without comorbid conditions. After one year, however, peritoneal dialysis was associated with markedly higher mortality (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.42).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a propensity-score analysis (in which peritoneal dialysis patients were matched with hemodialysis patients with known covariates) showed no difference in mortality between groups prior to one year (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89-1.10) and an increase in mortality associated with peritoneal dialysis after one year (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.27-1.42).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more recent, propensity-matched cohort study compared survival between patients who initiated peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis between 2001 and 2013 in a health care organization in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In order to remove the confounding effects on mortality of a hemodialysis catheter, only patients with an arteriovenous fistula or graft were included in the hemodialysis group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By as-treated and intent-to treat analyses, the cumulative HRs for death after one year were 2.38 (95% CI 1.67-3.38) and 2.09 (95% CI 1.49-2.92), respectively, for hemodialysis relative to peritoneal dialysis patients. The cumulative risk of death remained lower for peritoneal dialysis patients for nearly three years in the as-treated analysis and two years in the intent-to-treat analysis. There was no difference between groups in survival thereafter.</p><p/><p>Survival on peritoneal dialysis may be improving. According to the 2009 USRDS report, overall five-year survival continued to improve such that patients who started dialysis from 1998 to 2002 had a 7.5 percent increase in survival from that seen for patients who started dialysis from 1993 to 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Whereas there was 14.8 percent improvement in five-year survival for patients on peritoneal dialysis, there was only a 7.2 percent improvement for hemodialysis patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83658 \">figure 3</a>). The 2012, 2013, and the 2016 USRDS reports showed continued improvement in five-year survival for patients starting peritoneal dialysis up until the last reported cohort in 2009 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F115217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115217 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/52,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,64,65</a>]. Adjusted five-year survival for hemodialysis improved from 35.6 percent in the 2001 cohort to 41.5 percent in the 2009 cohort, while the adjusted five-year survival for patients on peritoneal dialysis improved from 39.4 percent in the 2001 cohort to 51.4 percent in the 2009 cohort.</p><p>USRDS data also suggest that the early benefit associated with peritoneal dialysis may be maintained for a longer period of time in more recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Whereas, among patients who started peritoneal dialysis between 1991 and 1995, survival was higher for peritoneal dialysis patients until 12 to 16 months but better among hemodialysis patients after that, among patients who started dialysis between 1996 and 2000, the survival advantage conferred by peritoneal dialysis was maintained for approximately 36 months.</p><p>Possible reasons for the improved observed survival among peritoneal dialysis patients may be that earlier mortality studies were published before the widespread use of alternative peritoneal dialysate solutions and prior to the implementation of robust home dialysis programs, the latter of which allow for refinement of clinician skills and establishment of continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs, which could improve patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/13,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,67</a>].</p><p>In summary, these data suggest that, at the start of renal replacement therapy, for most patients, survival on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis is similar, with perhaps a slight advantage favoring peritoneal dialysis. We should embrace other factors such as quality of life, patient convenience, and ability to travel. A study specifically examining the prevalence of contraindications to peritoneal dialysis in several centers in the United States and Canada found that, in general, approximately 78 percent of patients were candidates for peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Patients should be allowed to make a choice. We should be more proactive about providing an unbiased modality education and encourage patients to consider home dialysis much more often than has historically happened in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">High-flux and high-efficiency hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High efficiency refers to standard cellulosic membranes with a larger surface area, whereas high flux refers to more porous noncellulosic membranes with increased permeability, particularly to larger molecules.</p><p>These modalities may decrease morbidity (hypotension and symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, cramps, and headache) during dialysis.

The question of a possible survival benefit with high-flux dialysis was best addressed in a large, randomized clinical trial, called the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In this report, 1846 patients were randomly assigned to a low-flux or high-flux dialyzer (based on clearance of beta-2-microglobulin) and a standard or high dose of dialysis. The primary outcome was death from any cause, while the main secondary outcomes were the rate of all hospitalizations (but excluding those related to access) and the composite outcomes of the first hospitalization for a cardiac problem or death from any cause, the first hospitalization for an infectious cause or death, and the first decline of greater than 15 percent of the serum albumin from baseline value or death. Issues relating to dialysis dose and survival in this study are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following results concerning survival and membrane flux were reported at a mean follow-up of 4.5 years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impressive separation was obtained for the low- and high-flux groups, with clearances of beta-2-microglobulin of 3 and 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of death from any cause, the primary outcome, was the <strong>same</strong> in the high- and low-flux groups (RR of death of 0.92 for high versus low flux, 95% CI 0.81-1.05) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71570\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71570 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of the main secondary outcomes was also the <strong>same</strong> for both flux groups. In the high-flux group, there were significant reductions, compared with the low-flux group, in the risk of death from cardiac causes and the combined outcome of hospitalizations or death from a cardiac cause. However, as previously mentioned, total mortality was the same in both groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subgroup analysis revealed a significant overall survival and cardiovascular survival benefit for patients with more than 3.7 years of dialysis receiving high-flux dialysis (32 percent lower risk than the low-flux group, CI 0.53-0.86). However, the strength of the interaction between the flux group and years of dialysis was weakened when years of dialysis were treated as a continuous variable or were further subdivided into five groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, although there does not appear to be an overall survival benefit with high-flux dialysis membranes, subgroup analysis suggests a possible benefit with high-flux dialysis among longer vintage dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A similar finding showing a survival benefit with high-flux membranes among those undergoing dialysis was noted in a retrospective study from France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In this study, among 650 patients undergoing dialysis therapy for a mean period of 96 to 102 months, multivariate analysis revealed that survival was significantly higher among those undergoing dialysis with high-flux membranes (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.91).</p><p>A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis found that high-flux dialysis did not change all-cause mortality (10 studies, 2915 participants) but did decrease cardiovascular mortality (five studies, 2612 participants, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70&ndash;0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The dialysis vintage varied between studies, however, and subgroup analysis of patients with increased vintage was not performed.</p><p>Additional studies are required to confirm the suggested benefit of high-flux membranes among dialysis patients of increasing vintage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. The patient is not involved in deciding to use a high-flux or a high-efficiency hemodialysis membrane. Rather, the clinician prescribing hemodialysis decides which membrane to use based on the hemodialysis membranes available for in-center or home use at the dialysis unit that will be providing the patient's care. As noted above, the patient should be involved in deciding on in-center care (almost always <span class=\"nowrap\">3/week</span> daytime hemodialysis, although <span class=\"nowrap\">4/week</span> daytime hemodialysis, in-center nocturnal hemodialysis, and rarely even in-center peritoneal dialysis are other options) or home dialysis.</p><p>If the patient is interested in home dialysis, then the next step is to decide if the patient should do peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis (frequent short daily or nocturnal).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Home, nocturnal, and short daily hemodialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observed survival is generally highest in patients treated with home hemodialysis: up to 89 percent at 5 years, 74 percent at 15 years in nondiabetics, and 50 percent at 15 years overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-modality-and-patient-outcome/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. As was described for peritoneal dialysis versus center hemodialysis above, the magnitude of the survival advantage varies based on patient comorbidities and the time in the patient's ESRD lifetime that they decide to do home dialysis. However, despite this apparent survival advantage, the absolute number and relative percentage of patients with ESRD who use home hemodialysis in the United States has slowly declined over the last decade and is much lower than that in some other countries (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>). Based on these observations, it is important that home hemodialysis is presented to appropriate patients as a choice for their renal replacement therapy. Nocturnal hemodialysis (ie, long, nightly, home hemodialysis, a form of quotidian hemodialysis) was introduced, principally in Canada, as a (possibly) more desirable alternative to conventional dialysis since it provides quantitatively more dialysis, based upon dose, duration, and frequency. This can be accomplished because it is performed during nightly sleep, an otherwise unproductive time.</p><p>Based on better outcomes in many biochemical areas, quality-of-life issues, blood pressure control, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, improved sleep patterns, and improved general well-being, one would expect improved survival rates of these patients. There now are prospective randomized trial data, using cardiovascular endpoints as a surrogate for survival, that suggest that survival is truly improved with these modalities, with lower mortalities and similar survival rates to deceased-donor renal transplants. For all these reasons, it is the authors' opinion that nocturnal hemodialysis will be associated with improved patient survival since it provides the best clearance of uremic products, along with remarkable hemodynamic stability (with only gradual changes in physiological parameters) and improved cardiovascular function with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (which is a potent cardiovascular disease risk factor). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another modality is short-hours, high-efficiency daily hemodialysis (short daily hemodialysis), another form of quotidian hemodialysis. This consists of hemodialysis occurring five to six <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week,</span> with a total duration of 1.5 to 2.5 hours per day. Limited data have suggested relatively better survival among patients on short daily hemodialysis compared with in-center conventional hemodialysis.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Selection of dialysis modality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients can be treated with either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. The selection of dialysis modality is influenced by a number of considerations such as availability and convenience, comorbid conditions, socioeconomic and dialysis-center factors, the patient's home situation, method of clinician reimbursement, and the ability to tolerate volume shifts. Among some patients, it may be optimal to utilize both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis over the course of treatment.
