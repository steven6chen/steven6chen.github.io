As a result, the community will have a higher incidence of rare genetic disorders associated with the allele, a situation known as the &quot;founder effect.&quot; The increased incidence of Tay-Sachs disease and several other disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314 \">table 1</a>) among descendants of Ashkenazi Jews is an example of this phenomenon. Because these serious disorders are more common among Ashkenazi Jews, genetic carrier screening programs have been successful and have a high acceptance rate in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335917662\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ashkenazi Jews are descendants of Jews from Central and Eastern Europe (eg, Germany, France, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania), while Sephardic Jews are descendants of Jews from Spain, Portugal, and North Africa. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are an example of the founder effect. One in four to one in five individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent carry a mutation for one of the autosomal recessive disorders included in a group of disorders sometimes called &quot;Jewish genetic disorders&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some of these disorders have a high incidence, primarily among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (eg, Tay-Sachs disease); for many of the disorders (eg, familial dysautonomia), the mutation has been identified almost exclusively in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some of the disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis) are also common in other high-risk ethnic groups. Although the disorders can also affect Sephardic Jews, non-Jews, and Jews from mixed backgrounds, they are less prevalent in these populations. Most of the disorders are severely disabling, untreatable, and associated with a shortened life expectancy.</p><p>Carrier screening in this population is performed to identify asymptomatic individuals who carry genetic mutations causing any of the genetic disorders more common in descendants of Ashkenazi Jews. If both parents are carriers of a mutation causing the same disorder, there is a one in four chance their offspring will inherit two copies of the mutation (one from each parent) and will be susceptible to developing the phenotype. Identification of these couples gives them the opportunity to pursue reproductive options to avoid an affected pregnancy, prepare for the birth of an affected child, or terminate an affected pregnancy. Negative test results relieve some of the anxiety associated with pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H335917741\" class=\"local\">'Post-test management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335918492\"><span class=\"h2\">What to screen for</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratories offer screening panels that test for several disorders as a group in a single multiplex assay. The number of disorders included in panels for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is variable (eg, 4, 9, 11, or more), based in part on the carrier frequency in this population and the severity of the phenotype. Some panels include disorders that are rare even in this population if only a few mutations account for the majority of disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends routinely offering carrier screening for the following nine disorders: Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom Syndrome, and Gaucher disease, because of carrier detection rates &ge;90 percent and population carrier frequency of &ge;1 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on Genetics recommends routinely offering all Ashkenazi Jews carrier screening for four of the most common disorders that are either lethal or associated with significant morbidity: Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia, and considers offering an expanded panel an acceptable approach. The expanded panel would include these four disorders plus Bloom Syndrome, familial hyperinsulinism, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, glycogen storage disease type I, Joubert syndrome, Maple syrup urine disease, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann Pick disease type A, and Usher syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Some laboratories offer an expanded panel that includes carrier screening for other autosomal recessive disorders more prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. ACMG had published a position statement on <span class=\"nowrap\">prenatal/preconception</span> expanded carrier screening, which includes criteria for disease selection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F104779\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104779 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].<strong> </strong>Routinely screening for Maple Syrup Urine Disease, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, and Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1a is reasonable since the screening test has &gt;90 percent detection rate or allele frequency &ge;1 percent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and the disorders are associated with significant morbidity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality.</p><p>Screening for autosomal recessive diseases with an allele frequency &lt;1 percent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is controversial. These inherited diseases (and allele carrier frequencies) include nemaline myopathy (1 in 120), Usher syndrome type 1F (1 in 165), Usher syndrome type 3 (1 in 107), and Joubert syndrome (1 in 102). Testing for carrier status is indicated if a patient has a family member affected by one of these disorders or known to be a carrier of a gene responsible for one of these disorders; however, the value of routine population screening of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals for these disorders is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Allele frequency for Walker-Warburg syndrome has been reported to be 1 in 150 to 1 in 79 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is not included among disorders in ACOG or ACMG practice guidelines for screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but if allele frequency &ge;1 percent is used as a threshold for offering carrier screening, then it would be reasonable to offer carrier screening for Walker-Warburg syndrome in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</p><p>The author orders a 20-disease panel via multiplex assay that includes the <span class=\"nowrap\">nine-disease/syndrome</span> panel recommended by the ACMG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314 \">table 1</a>) and the following nine <span class=\"nowrap\">diseases/syndromes:</span> lipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, ABCC8-related hyperinsulinism, NEB-related nemaline myopathy type 2, Joubert 2, Usher type 1F, Usher type 3, glycogen storage type Ia, maple syrup urine, and Walker-Warburg. (The author also screens for spinal muscular atrophy and fragile X syndrome as she offers these tests to all patients regardless of ethnic background). If a specific mutation has been identified in an affected family member, the mutation should be included in the panel.</p><p>New technologies using DNA sequencing and microarray hybridization analysis allow more comprehensive, general population-based carrier screening for a large number of mutations. Some commercially available genetic carrier screening tests screen for several hundred genetic diseases (using either saliva or blood) at approximately the same cost as screening for single gene mutations. Although the introduction of these new tests has shifted the screening paradigm from the identification of ethnic-specific or family-specific risk factors for genetic disease to general population-based screening, the role of these newer generation tests versus traditional carrier screening as in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is unclear. In addition to the turmoil that can result from performing these screening tests without first providing genetic counseling, potential limitations of comprehensive testing are the detection of genes with mild phenotypes, variable expression, low penetrance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> identifying diseases characterized by adult onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For this reason, screening for any condition is optional, and if a patient requests screening only for a particular condition for which testing is available, the requested test should be offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This tenet holds true regardless of ethnicity and family history as long as the patient has been counseled on the risks, benefits, and limitations of screening. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists indicates that ethnic-specific, pan-ethnic, and expanded carrier screening are all acceptable strategies for carrier screening. When it comes to choosing between ethnic-specific, pan-ethnic, and expanded carrier screening, it is recommended that each obstetrician-gynecologist establish a standard approach within his or her practice that is offered to each patient consistently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the following approach for carrier screening for the disorders of concern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314 \">table 1</a>) as it is reasonable and generally consistent with that of the ACOG Committee on Genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and the ACMG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the personal and family history of individuals considering pregnancy or who are already pregnant to determine whether either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or has a relative with one or more genetic disorders more prevalent in this population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer carrier screening to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent &ndash; One grandparent of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is enough to justify testing. If Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is more remote, it is still prudent to offer screening, but patients should understand that carrier screening has variable sensitivity and specificity in the setting of mixed ancestry because the frequencies and known mutations of most of these diseases are less well-established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals unsure of their Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals with a relative with one of the genetic conditions prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Individuals with an affected first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) or second-degree relative <span class=\"nowrap\">(aunt/uncle,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">niece/nephew,</span> grandparent, half-sibling) are at high risk of being a carrier. This risk can be 33 to 100 percent, depending upon which relative is affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Whether to screen patients with a more remote family history of disease is controversial. As an example, if a fifth-degree relative (eg, second cousin) is known to have been affected with one of the diseases of concern, a patient has a 1 in 16 chance of being a carrier and this risk is higher than the carrier frequencies of most of the genetic diseases in the Ashkenazi population. Therefore, we believe any history of a blood relative with a confirmed autosomal recessive disease justifies offering carrier testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partners of individuals who are screen-positive, whether or not they are Ashkenazi Jews.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335919924\"><span class=\"h2\">Consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening programs should be voluntary, confidential, and with informed consent. If a screening panel is ordered, the patient should be informed about and consent to all of the diseases included in the panel.</p><p>It may not be practical for a clinician to discuss each disease included in a multi-disease carrier screening panel. The ACMG suggests giving patients an informational pamphlet or referring them to an internet site where they can obtain a brief description of each disorder included in the test panel. Genetic counseling before testing should be available for patients who want more information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and testing sequence</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before conception &ndash; Ideally, carrier testing of either partner of an Ashkenazi Jewish couple is initiated at a preconceptional counseling visit. If that partner tests positive, carrier testing can then be extended to the other partner (ie, sequential testing). If testing is negative, the other partner is not tested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that partner should be screened first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During pregnancy &ndash; If the woman is already pregnant and only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that partner should be screened first. However, carrier testing of both partners can also be performed simultaneously at the first prenatal visit. Screening results are typically available in one to two weeks. This should allow ample time for further prenatal evaluation and diagnosis in the event that both partners screen positive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Test requisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carrier testing for each disease generally involves DNA mutation analysis for that disease. There are many different mutations associated with the various diseases; thus, the test requisition typically states &quot;DNA mutation analysis for&quot; and then lists the <span class=\"nowrap\">diseases/syndromes</span> for which the patient has consented to be screened (eg, Tay-Sachs, Bloom, cystic fibrosis) rather than a specific mutation. An exception is Tay-Sachs screening. In this case, biochemical analysis is preferred as the primary testing method because it is more sensitive&nbsp;than DNA testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, biochemical screening for hexosaminidase A activity detects 98 percent of carriers compared with 93 or 94 percent of carriers with DNA-based assays that test for the three common mutations accounting for &gt;95 percent of disease alleles in this population (1278insTATC, G269S, 1421&nbsp;+&nbsp;1GC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In low-risk populations, biochemical analysis identifies almost all carriers, while DNA mutation analysis may identify only 50 percent of carriers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335919865\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of results and post-test genetic counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-test genetic counseling should be available for those with positive screening results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>If both parents are carriers, each offspring has a 25 percent chance of inheriting the disease, a 50 percent chance of being a carrier, and a 25 percent chance of not inheriting the affected allele. Post-test counseling should include an explanation of the mutation(s) detected; risk of disease; clinical manifestations, range of severity, natural history, and management of the disorder; options for fetal testing and reproductive decision-making; and implications for other family members at risk for the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This discussion is made easier by appropriate pretest counseling, during which many of these issues will have been introduced. When an individual is found to be a carrier, <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> relatives are also at risk for carrying the same mutation; the individual should be encouraged to discuss this information with them.</p><p>A negative screening test result for one or both partners significantly reduces the possibility of an affected offspring, but does not exclude it, because test sensitivity is less than 100 percent, and therefore not every carrier is identified. Genetic counseling should inform the couple of the residual risk for the disease.</p><p>For example, the residual risk of being a carrier after a negative test result in an individual of full Ashkenazi Jewish descent is <span class=\"nowrap\">1/400</span> for cystic fibrosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2700</span> for Tay-Sachs disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2500</span> for Canavan disease, and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/4900</span> for familial dysautonomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. DNA mutation analysis has lower sensitivity in the non-Ashkenazi Jewish population, so residual risk may be higher. In a couple in which one partner carries a mutation causing Tay-Sachs disease, biochemical testing of the partner may clarify whether <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is a carrier with an unrecognized mutation. Gene&nbsp;sequencing&nbsp;can help identify rare mutations in individuals with a family history of Tay-Sachs disease, evaluate partners of known carriers of Tay-Sachs disease who have indeterminate enzyme analysis and negative common mutation analysis, and resolve ambiguous results from enzyme tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>If the carrier is pregnant and the partner is not available for testing, the risk of fetal disease can be estimated based on the carrier rate in the partner's ethnic group, and options for fetal diagnosis should be discussed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335917741\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-test management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335917695\"><span class=\"h3\">Both partners positive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When carrier mutations are identified preconceptionally in both parents, they may choose to avoid pregnancy, use gametes from a donor who is a noncarrier, employ preimplantation genetic diagnosis with transfer of only unaffected embryos, or conceive naturally and undergo prenatal diagnosis if desired.</p><p>If pregnancy is already established, fetal DNA testing can be performed on chorionic villi at 10 to 14 weeks of gestation or on <span class=\"nowrap\">amniocytes/amniotic</span> fluid at &ge;15 weeks of gestation.

Due to the founder effect, Tay-Sachs disease is also relatively more common in individuals of Pennsylvania Dutch, Southern Louisiana Cajun, or Eastern Quebec French Canadian descent. Because of screening protocols initiated in the 1970s targeting Ashkenazi Jews, including pre-marriage screening and prenatal testing, the number of cases of Tay-Sachs disease detected prenatally in the non-Jewish population has increased three- to fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and the disease burden from Tay-Sachs disease has been reduced by 90 percent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease is characterized by normal motor development in the first few months of life.

Ashkenazi Jewish carrier testing should start with DNA mutation analysis. Non-Jews should also be tested for a fourth mutation, which accounts for 15 percent of mutations in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme analysis &ndash; Enzyme assays can measure activity of Hex A and Hex B in serum or leukocytes. Tay-Sachs disease carriers have decreased Hex A activity and normal or increased activity of Hex B. Enzyme analysis can also be performed on amniocytes or chorionic villus cells.</p><p/><p>Although the enzyme test is cost-effective, it has several limitations. First, there may be overlap in carrier and non-carrier range, making the test inconclusive in some cases. The test also can be unreliable in pregnant patients and in women on hormonal forms of contraception. In these instances, serum levels of Hex A can be falsely elevated, increasing the likelihood of false-negative screening test results (a positive test is a low level of Hex A). </p><p>If biochemical screening is performed in pregnant women or women taking oral contraceptives, leukocytes must be used &#160; Biochemical testing also may identify carriers of pseudodeficiency alleles, which are alleles that are associated with decreased Hex A activity, but are not associated with the disease. For these reasons, ambiguous or positive biochemical results should be confirmed by DNA analysis for the most common mutations.</p><p>Because of the limitations of biochemical testing discussed above, DNA testing should be performed first in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].
