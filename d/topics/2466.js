But it's also important to eat and drink foods that have calcium and vitamin D. Eating enough calcium and vitamin D is an important first step in preventing and treating osteoporosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665286929\"><span class=\"h1\">What foods and drinks have calcium and vitamin D?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different foods and drinks have calcium and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 1</a>). Some foods and drinks have more calcium and vitamin D than others.</p><p>Foods and drinks that have a lot of calcium include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk, yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, ice cream, and other dairy foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Green vegetables, such as kale, collard greens, and broccoli</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain nuts and breads</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods that have calcium added to them, such as juices, cereals, and soy products</p><p/><p>Foods and drinks that have a lot of vitamin D include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milk, orange juice, or yogurt with vitamin D added</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cooked salmon or mackerel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Canned tuna fish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cereals with vitamin D added</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cod liver oil</p><p/><p>Your body can also get vitamin D from the sun. The body uses sunlight that shines on the skin to make vitamin D. But doctors don't suggest spending a lot of time in the sun to get vitamin D. That's because getting too much sun can lead to serious problems, including skin cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665286936\"><span class=\"h1\">What are supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplements are pills, capsules, liquids, or tablets that have nutrients in them. Supplements are another way people can get calcium and vitamin D. Some supplements contain either calcium or vitamin D. Others have both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665286943\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take calcium or vitamin D supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who do not get enough calcium or vitamin D from their food and drink might need to take supplements.</p><p>If your doctor recommends that you take calcium or vitamin D supplements, ask him or her which type, how much, and when to take the supplements. For example, some calcium supplements can be taken with food, but others should be taken on an empty stomach.</p><p>The type and dose of supplement that is right for you will also depend on your medical problems and the other medicines you take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665286950\"><span class=\"h1\">What are some common side effects of calcium supplements?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common side effects of calcium supplements can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation &ndash; People who are constipated can have trouble having bowel movements.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upset stomach</p><p/><p>Many people find that they can reduce these side effects by splitting up their calcium dose. For example, they might take a few small doses of calcium each day instead of one large dose.</p><p>Taking calcium supplements can also increase a person's chance of getting kidney stones. Kidney stones are small, hard stone-like objects that can form in a person's kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665286957\"><span class=\"h1\">How much calcium and vitamin D do I need each day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends, because each person is different. Ask your doctor or nurse how much calcium and vitamin D you need each day. Women who have gone through menopause and no longer get monthly periods usually need more calcium each day than women who still get monthly periods.</p><p>It is important not to take too much calcium or vitamin D. Taking too much calcium or vitamin D can cause problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665286964\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paget-disease-of-bone-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Paget disease of bone (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-for-babies-and-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vitamin D for babies and children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vitamin D deficiency (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
