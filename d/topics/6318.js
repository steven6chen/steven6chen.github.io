Atherosclerosis of the noncardiac vessels is defined as peripheral artery disease (PAD). An ankle-brachial index (ABI) &le;0.90 is sensitive and specific for arterial <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion</span> and diagnostic for PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Although other disease processes can lead to narrowing of the arteries (eg, inflammation, thrombosis) and symptoms of arterial insufficiency, PAD is by far the most prevalent etiology. The lower extremity vessels are affected more commonly than the upper extremity vessels.</p><p>Ischemic symptoms result when there is an imbalance between the supply and demand for blood flow. The clinical manifestations of PAD depend upon the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion, and range from mild extremity pain with activity (ie, claudication) to limb-threatening ischemia. For patients found to have asymptomatic PAD, the natural history is relatively benign; however, for those patients with PAD who continue to smoke or have diabetes or renal insufficiency, the clinical manifestations can progress rapidly and unpredictably.</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of peripheral artery disease are reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and management of peripheral artery disease are discussed elsewhere.

In 2010, 202 million people around the world were living with PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In Europe and North America, an estimated 27 million individuals are affected with approximately 413,000 inpatient admissions annually attributed to PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of individuals with PAD (70 percent) live in <span class=\"nowrap\">low/middle</span> income regions of the world, including 55 million individuals in southeast Asia and 46 million in the western pacific region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The number of individuals with PAD increased by 29 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">low/middle</span> income regions and 13 percent in high income regions from 2000 to 2010 compared with the preceding decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In a study that included over 3 million participants in Life Line screening (LLS, Independence, Ohio) in the United States, PAD was present in 3.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. PAD is more prevalent in older individuals, certain ethnic populations, families with atherosclerosis, and in those with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. </p><p>Risk factors that favor the development of PAD are similar to those that promote the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. However, the Scottish Heart Health Extended Cohort identified some risk factor differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among over 15,000 men and women aged 30 to 75 years who were free of PAD or CHD and followed for 15 to 25 years, 19.7 percent developed CHD and 3.2 percent developed PAD. PAD and CHD shared seven of the nine of the ASSIGN risk score variables, including age, gender, family history, socioeconomic status, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and systolic blood pressure, and four biomarkers (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide [NT-pro-BNP], cotinine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cystatin-C).&nbsp;For PAD, markers associated with inflammation and&nbsp;tobacco smoking predominated, while total cholesterol and body mass were less important. The highest ranked adjusted hazard ratios in PAD were age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, expired carbon monoxide, cotinine, socioeconomic status, and lipoprotein(a).&nbsp;Diabetes mellitus was also an important risk factor but not the most common cause of PAD. These identified differences in risk factors&nbsp;for PAD versus CHD may indicate subtle differences in pathophysiology. </p><p>The American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on PAD have identified the risk groups below, which are associated with an increased prevalence of PAD and earlier onset of symptomatic PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/4,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,8</a>].

There were 537 cases of incident PAD defined as limb amputation or revascularization, angiogram reporting vascular obstruction &ge;50 percent, ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.90, or physician-diagnosed PAD. Each risk factor (smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes) was significantly and independently associated with a higher risk of PAD after adjustment for the other three risk factors, and confounders. Men without any of the four risk factors had a lower risk of PAD compared with all other men in the cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.23, 95% CI 0.14-0.36). The age-adjusted incidence rates (cases per 100,000 person-years) were 9 for no risk factors, 23 for one risk factor, 47 for two risk factors, 92 for three risk factors, and 186 for four risk factors. The population-attributable risk for PAD associated with these four risk factors was 75 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, a study evaluating data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] determined the cumulative effects of known risk factors for peripheral artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Risk factors for PAD used in the model included age, gender, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and smoking. The likelihood of PAD increased with each additional risk factor present. With one risk factor present relative to no risk factors, the risk for PAD was not significant (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI, 0.9-2.6). For two risk factors, the risk for PAD was nearly quadrupled (OR 3.7 95% CI 2.3&ndash;6.1), and for three risk factors the risk was increased 10-fold (OR 10.2, 95% CI 6.4-16.3). Smoking was the single factor associated with the highest risk for PAD. Non-Hispanic Blacks and women, who had the highest prevalence rates, were particularly sensitive to this cumulative effect. A higher prevalence of current smoking among women and non-Hispanic Blacks may explain the excessive risk of PAD in these populations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidemiologic model based upon a systematic review of the prevalence of PAD (defined as an ankle-brachial index &le;0.90) around the world was used to compare predicted PAD prevalence in three high income and five <span class=\"nowrap\">low/middle</span> income World Health Organization (WHO) regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were important risk factors in high and <span class=\"nowrap\">low/middle</span> income regions.

As a result, PAD is a growing clinical problem in the United States and other developed countries due to an aging population.

However, only half of aged patients are symptomatic from lower extremity PAD, often because of other comorbidities that limit mobility, such as arthritis, cardiac disease, and pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The relationship between PAD prevalence and age was illustrated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>].

However, the population-based prevalence of PAD in women has not been fully evaluated. In population studies, the prevalence of PAD in women is at least as high as that of men across all age groups, but increases to a greater extent in women after age 70 compared with men of the same age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. In a review of 133,750 women and 71,996 men who underwent voluntary screening for PAD (ie, Lifeline), women were significantly more likely to have ABI &le;0.9 (4.1 versus 2.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a large review, incident cardiovascular disease varied by type of presentation (eg, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm), age, and gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The risk difference between men and women for an initial presentation of peripheral artery disease was most pronounced for men aged 50 to 59, with a twofold increase compared with women. </p><p>In a population study of individuals 60 to 90 years of age in Sweden, women had a higher prevalence of PAD compared with men, when ABI only was used to diagnose PAD (asymptomatic: 12.6 versus 9.4 percent). In this study, the prevalence of severe limb ischemia was higher in women compared with men (1.5 versus 0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Similar results were found in a retrospective review of 231 consecutive patients diagnosed with PAD following referral to a vascular laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The prevalence of severe limb ischemia was 13.2 percent in women and 4.3 percent in men. The difference was likely related to the significantly higher incidence of hypercholesterolemia (88.2 percent versus 73 percent), metabolic syndrome (78 percent versus 43 percent), and diabetes (67.6 percent versus 42.9 percent) found in the female patients. </p><p>Whether there is any effect of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women on the development of PAD is largely unknown. One study of 847,982 postmenopausal women found that in spite of an increased prevalence of several atherosclerotic risk factors among women who used hormone replacement therapy, they were significantly less likely to have PAD (3.3 versus 4.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The prevalence of PAD is higher in African Americans than non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/11,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,37-39</a>]. The difference does not appear to be completely explained by differences in the prevalence of risk factors for atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. African and Hispanic Americans have higher rates of diabetes and hypertension, whereas Caucasians are more likely to have hypercholesterolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found an increased prevalence of PAD for African Americans (men and women), and also Hispanic American women compared with non-Hispanic Caucasian Americans (19.2 and 19.3 percent, respectively, versus 15.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in the San Diego Population Study, a survey of 2343 randomly-selected participants, African Americans had a significantly higher prevalence of PAD (7.8 versus 4.9 percent) compared with non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this study, PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) &le;0.90, an abnormal Doppler waveform, or prior revascularization for PAD. Although African Americans had significantly higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and greater body mass index, the increased risk for PAD was maintained after adjustment for these and other variables. Hispanic and Asian Americans had somewhat lower rates of PAD than non-Hispanic whites, but the difference was not significant. In a multi-ethnic Asian (Chinese, Malays, and Indians) population study from Singapore, PAD was present in 4.3 percent of the population, and a high ABI &gt;1.4 was rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A systematic review identified 14 studies comparing prevalence between South Asians and white Europeans and found a significantly lower risk of PAD in South Asians with coronary artery disease odds ratio (OR) 0.47 (95% CI 0.39-0.56), and diabetes (OR = 0.44 95% CI, 0.30-0.63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21070132\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history and genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a family history of cardiovascular disease appear to be at increased risk, although the relative contributions of genetics and environmental factors are not fully elucidated but continue to be an active area of investigation.

Studies that have investigated heritable factors in the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD), include family and twin studies, ankle-brachial index variance analysis, and gene studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/43-45,47-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45,47-53</a>]. </p><p>Several studies have found that 20 to 50 percent of the variance in ankle-brachial index (ABI) can be explained by genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. However, in spite of finding such correlations, investigators of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin study found no significant difference in the prevalence of PAD for identical (monozygotic) compared with fraternal (dizygotic) twins (33 percent versus 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In contrast, a study using data from the Swedish Twin Registry and the national patient discharge registry, found that traditional cardiovascular risk factors were significantly more prevalent in twins with PAD compared with those without PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Concordances and correlations were higher in monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins, suggesting genetic influences in PAD. The risk of PAD for persons whose twin had PAD was significantly increased compared with persons whose twin did not have PAD (OR 17.7, 95% CI, 11.7-26.6 for monozygotic twins, OR 5.7, 95% CI 4.1-7.9 for dizygotic twins).

During follow-up (ranging from 1 to 13 years), approximately 7 percent of asymptomatic PAD patients progressed to claudication, and 21 percent of claudication patients were diagnosed as having critical limb ischemia, with 4 to 27 percent undergoing amputations.

As a result, PAD is growing as a clinical problem due to the aging population in the United States and other developed countries. As such, a standard review during the examination of older patients should always include questions related to a history of walking impairment, extremity pain with ambulation, and the presence of nonhealing wounds. (See <a href=\"#H2543090771\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for peripheral artery disease are similar to those that promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis (ie, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome). Other factors include age, gender, ethnicity, family history and genetic influences, and possibly homocysteinemia. The American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on PAD identified the following groups at risk for lower extremity PAD (See <a href=\"#H21056745\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age &ge;70 years</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age 50 to 69 years with a history of smoking or diabetes </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age 40 to 49 with diabetes and at least one other risk factor for atherosclerosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leg symptoms suggestive of claudication with exertion or ischemic pain at rest </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal lower extremity pulse examination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Known atherosclerosis at other sites (eg, coronary, carotid, renal artery disease) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of PAD increases progressively with age, beginning after age 40. Individuals over 70 are at a significantly increased risk for PAD due to age alone, while the risk for younger individuals is due to other factors, most commonly cigarette smoking. Early-onset atherosclerosis, or premature atherosclerosis, is defined as PAD presenting prior to 50 years of age. Patients with early-onset atherosclerosis more often present with critical limb ischemia and have poor overall outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H21057025\" class=\"local\">'Age'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21055452\" class=\"local\">'Early-onset atherosclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender and ethnic-related differences in prevalence of PAD have been documented. PAD is cited historically as more prevalent in men overall compared with women. However, the population-based prevalence of PAD in women has not been fully evaluated. The prevalence of PAD in women is at least as high as that of men across all age groups, but increases to a greater extent in women after age 70 compared with men of the same age, African Americans having a higher prevalence of PAD than non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics and Asians having a somewhat lower rate of PAD than non-Hispanic whites. (See <a href=\"#H21057032\" class=\"local\">'Gender'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21057372\" class=\"local\">'Ethnicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of peripheral artery disease in patients who present initially as asymptomatic or with mild to moderate intermittent claudication is relatively benign. Of those with intermittent claudication, 70 to 80 percent have stable claudication, 10 to 20 percent develop worsened claudication, and only approximately 1 to 2 percent progress to critical limb ischemia. The prognosis for limb loss or survival is significantly worse in those with early-onset atherosclerosis, patients with diabetes or end-stage renal disease, and for those who continue to smoke.
