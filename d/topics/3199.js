Knowledge of the normal physiology and pathophysiology of CSF production and flow is useful in interpreting such test results.</p><p>This topic will review the normal physiology and composition of CSF. The technique for obtaining CSF via lumbar puncture and the complications and contraindications to this test are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Technique, indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CSF analysis in children is presented elsewhere.

The choroid plexus consists of projections of vessels and pia mater that protrude into the ventricular cavities as frond-like villi containing capillaries in loose connective stroma. A specialized layer of ependymal cells called the choroidal epithelium overlies these villi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57840 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>CSF is formed in the choroid plexus by both filtration and active transport. In normal adults, the CSF volume is 125 to 150 mL; approximately 20 percent of the CSF is contained in the ventricles; the rest is contained in the subarachnoid space in the cranium and spinal cord. The normal rate of CSF production is approximately 20 mL per hour.</p><p>CSF circulates from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle and then the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct. Thereafter, CSF passes through apertures in the fourth ventricle into the subarachnoid space at the base of the brain and then flows over the convexities of the brain and down the length of the spinal cord. The CSF is propelled along the neuroaxis by a cranio-caudal pulsatile wave induced by flow in the cerebral arteries and by the associated expansions of the vascular compartment in the cranial vault.</p><p>CSF is reabsorbed in the arachnoid villi, located along the superior sagittal and intracranial venous sinuses and around the spinal nerve roots. Each arachnoid villus functions as a one-way valve permitting unidirectional flow of CSF into the blood. Arachnoid villi and venous sinuses are separated by endothelial cells connected by tight junctions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57840 \">figure 1</a>). Arachnoid villi normally allow the passage of particles less than 7.5 micron in diameter from the CSF into the blood.</p><p>Movement of CSF and cellular components across arachnoid villi occurs via transport within giant vesicles. These vesicles may become obstructed by bacteria or cells as a result of an inflammatory process or by red blood cells during subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p>Lipid-soluble molecules or drugs readily diffuse across the vascular endothelium and epithelium of the choroid plexus into the interstitial fluid and CSF. In contrast, ionically charged molecules generally require active transport for entry into the CSF. Drug entry also may be altered in patients with meningitis by the accompanying inflammation, and this may subsequently rapidly change with regression of this inflammation with therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'CSF in CNS infection'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to these well-described transport mechanisms, newer studies have documented the existence of other pathways involved in the movement of CSF and solutes throughout the central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These include perivascular pathways within the CNS parenchyma that support the clearance of solutes from the brain to the CSF and extra-axial meningeal lymphatic vessels associated with the dural sinuses that facilitate the movement of solutes in the CSF into the systemic vascular system. The finding of dura-associated lymphatic vessels is contrary to long-held beliefs about the absence of meningeal lymphatics. The role of these lymphatic pathways, however, in the clearance of interstitial and CSF solutes has not yet been elucidated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CSF PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion and reabsorption remain in balance in most healthy individuals to maintain a CSF pressure less than 150 mm H<sub>2</sub>0. The normal CSF pressure as measured with a manometer in a patient lying flat in the lateral decubitus position with the legs extended is between 60 and 250 mm H<sub>2</sub>0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, some experts consider the upper limit of normal CSF pressure to be 200 mm H<sub>2</sub>0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54738\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54738 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although obese patients tend to have higher opening pressures than nonobese patients, the correlation between opening pressure and body mass index was weak in a study involving 242 outpatients with a variety of neurologic complaints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conditions that are not associated with elevated CSF pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Finally, it is important to note that a variety of factors, such as the patient's position, the skill of the person performing the lumbar puncture, and the degree of relaxation of the patient can affect the measurement of the opening pressure.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of an increase in CSF pressure includes both infectious and noninfectious diseases and relates to disruptions in the normal physiology of CSF secretion and absorption and whether or not compensatory mechanisms develop if secretion or absorption of CSF is altered. Processes, such as infection, bleeding, or a tumor, can alter the balance between CSF secretion and reabsorption and thus cause intracranial hypertension. However, slow-growing masses, such as abscesses or tumors, may allow time for compensation between CSF secretion and absorption to occur; thus, a rise in CSF pressure may not occur until the normal compliance of the intracranial structures is overcome. In contrast, acute infections, such as meningitis, typically lead to rapid increases in CSF pressure due to alterations in either production or reabsorption of CSF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Increased intracranial pressure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children: Neurologic complications&quot;, section on 'Increased intracranial pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Downward and backward shifting of the cerebrum and brainstem may occur when intracranial hypertension develops, resulting in either respiratory depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death due to herniation of the cingulate gyrus, the uncus of the temporal lobe, or the cerebellar tonsils. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;blood-brain barrier&quot; is used to describe barrier systems that separate the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the blood and prevent entry by simple diffusion of fluids, electrolytes, and other substances from blood into the CSF or brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are actually two barriers: a blood-brain barrier and a blood-CSF barrier. Both barriers separate the central nervous system (CNS) from systemic immune responses and affect the composition of the brain interstitial fluid and CSF. The blood-brain and the blood-CSF barriers are not precisely equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood-brain barrier</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blood-brain barrier controls the content of brain interstitial fluid. It has a 5000-fold greater surface area than the blood-CSF barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The anatomic basis for the blood-brain barrier is a series of high-resistance, tight junctions between endothelial cells as well as astrocytes with processes that terminate in overlapping fashion on capillary walls.</p><p>Lipid-soluble small molecules with a molecular mass less than 400 to 600 Da are transported readily through the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, many drugs and other small molecules cannot cross this barrier system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood-CSF barrier</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blood-CSF barrier controls the composition of the CSF, which, as noted above, is primarily dependent upon secretion in the choroid plexus. The blood-CSF barrier is formed by tight junctions between choroid epithelial cells.</p><p>Both barrier systems are dynamic. Endothelial cells and astrocytes that compose the blood-brain barrier and cells forming the blood-CSF barrier are capable of producing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukins. In addition, astrocytes can act as antigen-presenting cells that modulate the immunologic response to CNS infections. Release of cytokines from endothelial cells and astrocytes probably mediate or generate much of the CNS inflammatory response in infectious and noninfectious conditions.</p><p>A brain-CSF barrier also exists in the pia mater. A continuous layer of astrocytes overlies the basement membrane of cells in the pia mater. These astrocytes are separated by gap junctions that affect the movement of constituents from the CSF into the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbe entry in meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which bacteria or other microbes traverse the blood-brain barrier and enter the CNS remains poorly understood. A number of theories have been advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microbes in the blood could traverse the blood-brain barrier via attachment of specific bacterial surface constituents to endothelial cells. Such surface constituents include the capsular polysaccharide present on many of the encapsulated bacteria that cause acute bacterial meningitis. As an example, the phosphorylcholine moiety of the pneumococcal cell wall lipoteichoic acid appears to utilize endogenous receptors for platelet activating factor to facilitate attachment and transcellular migration across endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pili on gram-negative rods may facilitate bacterial entry into the brain or CSF.

Both infectious and noninfectious processes can alter the appearance of the CSF. As few as 200 white blood cells <span class=\"nowrap\">(WBCs)/microL</span> or 400 red blood cells <span class=\"nowrap\">(RBCs)/microL</span> will cause CSF to appear turbid. CSF will appear grossly bloody if &ge;6000 <span class=\"nowrap\">RBCs/microL</span> are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Red blood cells rapidly lyse after entry into CSF. The breakdown of hemoglobin first to oxyhemoglobin (pink) and later to bilirubin (yellow) leads to a yellow or pink discoloration of the CSF known as xanthochromia. Spectrophotometry can be used to analyze blood breakdown products as they progress from oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin and finally to bilirubin, thereby ruling out traumatic blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Although xanthochromia is generally confirmed visually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], laboratory confirmation with spectrophotometry may be more sensitive and, if available, is recommended by some experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>].</p><p>Xanthochromia can be detected as soon as two to four hours after RBCs have entered the subarachnoid space, and therefore this is often used in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Xanthochromia is present in over 90 percent of patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage within 12 hours of the onset of bleeding, and it may persist thereafter for two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/9,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15-17</a>].

However, up to 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs are considered normal in adults when the CSF is sampled by lumbar puncture (LP). More than 3 polymorphonuclear leukocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">(PMNs)/microL</span> are abnormal in adults. The CSF cell profiles in neonates and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cell count'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cell count'</a>.)</p><p>The CSF cell count determination should be performed promptly since the count may be falsely low if measured more than 60 minutes after the LP is performed. This spuriously low cell count may be due to settling of the cells in the CSF over time <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adherence of RBCs or PMNs to plastic tubes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594373286\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated CSF WBC concentration does not diagnose an infection, since increases in the CSF WBC concentration can occur in a variety of both infectious and noninfectious inflammatory states. The following truisms about the interpretation of CSF cell counts may be useful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CSF cell count must always be correlated with clinical findings. PMNs, for example, predominate in the CSF of as many as two-thirds of patients with meningitis due to enteroviruses; a shift to lymphocytic predominance occurs within 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. On the other hand, lymphocytes rarely predominate in the early phases of bacterial meningitis.

CSF eosinophilia may occur in parasitic infestations but also in infections due to other microorganisms, including <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>, some fungi, and in noninfectious conditions, such as lymphomas, leukemias of various types, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and obstructive hydrocephalus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Predicted WBC count after traumatic tap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accidental trauma to a capillary or venule may occur during performance of an LP, increasing the number of both RBCs and WBCs in the CSF. If a traumatic lumbar puncture is suspected and the peripheral WBC count is not abnormally low or high, a good rule of thumb for estimating the adjusted WBC count is to subtract 1 WBC for every 500 to 1500 RBCs measured in the CSF. The formula in the following Calculator can also be used to determine the adjusted WBC count in the presence of CSF RBCs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-adjusted-cerebrospinal-fluid-white-blood-cell-count-in-the-presence-of-red-blood-cells\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Elevations in oligoclonally expanded immunoglobulin concentrations in the CSF, termed oligoclonal bands, may occur in any disorder that disrupts the blood-brain barrier. Oligoclonal bands may also be caused by intrathecal production of IgG, and the presence of such bands is a diagnostic criterion for multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Examples of other diseases that can cause oligoclonal bands in the CSF include infections (eg, nervous system Lyme disease), autoimmune diseases, brain tumors, and lymphoproliferative diseases.

Abnormally low CSF glucose concentrations (hypoglycorrhachia) can occur in bacterial meningitis and mycobacterial, mycoplasmal (<em>M. pneumoniae</em>), treponemal, and fungal CNS infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107252\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107252 \">table 1</a>).
