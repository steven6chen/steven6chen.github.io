All HCV genotypes can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis. The acute process is self-limited, rarely causes hepatic failure, and usually leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years and can ultimately result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of treatment is to eradicate HCV RNA, which is predicted by the achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR), defined by the absence of HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction 12 weeks after stopping treatment. An SVR is associated with a 99 percent chance of being HCV RNA negative during long-term follow-up and can therefore be considered cured of the HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-4-5-and-6-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, the cost of these new agents prevents universal delivery of antiviral therapy, particularly in resource-limited settings where these genotypes are prevalent. When resources are constrained, prioritizing patients who may benefit most from antiviral treatment may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H620696534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Deciding when to treat'</a>.) </p><p>In locations where interferon-free regimens are unavailable, regimens for genotypes 4, 5, and 6 continue to include peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, and it may be preferable to defer therapy to avoid the attendant side effects with such regimens.</p><p>The decision on whether to treat now with an interferon-based regimen or defer therapy to await more effective or better tolerated regimens should take into account the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Current liver disease stage</strong> &ndash; This is the main factor that informs the risk of morbidity from liver disease deferring therapy. If a patient has early stage liver fibrosis (none to portal or periportal fibrosis) and has no indications that there is rapidly progressive disease, it is unlikely that he will progress to clinically significant liver fibrosis over several years. In contrast, if the patient has bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis, many clinicians favor initiating antiviral treatment given the risk of developing decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Factors associated with disease progression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extrahepatic manifestations</strong> &ndash; If serious extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection, such as mixed cryoglobulinemia or glomerulonephritis are present, prompt antiviral therapy can improve these effects. However, in some cases, slightly delaying antiviral therapy to allow initiation of immunosuppressive therapy may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome#H1233455\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome&quot;, section on 'Initiation of HCV therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Likely efficacy of therapy</strong> &ndash; Alternative interferon-containing regimens have suboptimal efficacy rates among certain patient populations, such as those with cirrhosis or with a history of prior partial or null response to antiviral therapy. Deferring interferon-based therapy may be particularly attractive for such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Expected adverse effects of therapy</strong> &ndash; Deferring interferon-based therapy may be particularly attractive to individuals who have relative contraindications to peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> or would otherwise be more likely to suffer adverse effects.

In contrast, some patients may not be immediately appropriate for antiviral therapy because of adherence concerns or personal preference, even if an interferon-free regimen is available to them. </p><p/><p>For patients who do defer antiviral treatment, liver wellness (eg, alcohol abstinence, maintaining a healthy weight, control of diabetes mellitus) and close monitoring of clinical status are warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1735447792\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF TREATMENT REGIMENS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1735447799\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several interferon-free regimens have high expected efficacy against genotype 4 infection.

The choice between them depends primarily on potential for drug interactions, availability, and cost. If these are not an issue, we favor ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, or glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for the avoidance of ribavirin and ease of administration (once-daily dosing) with these regimens. If the only available option is sofosbuvir plus peginterferon and ribavirin, we favor deferring therapy until interferon-free regimens are available unless patient characteristics (such as advanced liver disease or severe extrahepatic manifestations) warrant earlier treatment.

(See <a href=\"#H2080848469\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of genotypes 4, 5, and 6'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interferon-free regimens have demonstrated efficacy for genotypes 4, 5, and 6, but these may not be widely available because of cost or other issues. Other regimens for genotypes 4, 5, and 6 continue to include peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>. The decision to treat a patient at this time or await availability of interferon-free regimens should take into account the expected efficacy and adverse effects of available regimens, history of prior antiviral therapy, the current liver disease stage, extrahepatic manifestations, and patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H1735447621\" class=\"local\">'Deciding when to treat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective interferon-free regimens for genotype 4 infection include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ledipasvir-and-sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a> for 12 weeks, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-and-velpatasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> for 12 weeks, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glecaprevir-and-pibrentasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a> for 8 weeks (for patients without cirrhosis) or for 12 weeks (for patients with cirrhosis), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbasvir-and-grazoprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elbasvir-grazoprevir</a> for 12 weeks (for treatment-na&iuml;ve) or for 16 weeks with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> (for treatment-experienced), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ombitasvir-paritaprevir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir</a> plus weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> plus weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks. The choice between them depends primarily on potential for drug interactions, availability, and cost. If these are not issues, we suggest ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, or glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If interferon-free regimens are not available, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir plus peginterferon and weight-based ribavirin is also highly effective for treatment-na&iuml;ve patients but has the added toxicity of peginterferon. Furthermore, the efficacy of this regimen is uncertain in treatment-experienced patients. (See <a href=\"#H1735447799\" class=\"local\">'Genotype 4'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on treatment of genotype 5 and 6 infection are limited. For patients with genotype 5 or 6 infection, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ledipasvir-and-sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ledipasvir-sofosbuvir</a> for 12 weeks, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-and-velpatasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir-velpatasvir</a> for 12 weeks, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glecaprevir-and-pibrentasvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glecaprevir-pibrentasvir</a> for 8 weeks (for patients without cirrhosis) or for 12 weeks (for patients with cirrhosis) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If these interferon-free regimens are cost-prohibitive or otherwise unavailable, the 12-week regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> plus peginterferon and weight-based <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> is also expected to be highly effective in the treatment-na&iuml;ve. (See <a href=\"#H2080844825\" class=\"local\">'Genotype 5'</a> above and <a href=\"#H757195663\" class=\"local\">'Genotype 6'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interferon-free regimens are generally well tolerated, although the potential for drug interactions should be reviewed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ribavirin</a> is potentially teratogenic, so two effective forms of contraception should be used by both men and women of child-conceiving potential during and six months after treatment with ribavirin-containing regimens. Peginterferon and ribavirin are associated with a number of other side effects. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.
