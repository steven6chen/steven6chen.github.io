Therapy consists of thyroid hormone replacement, unless the hypothyroidism is transient (as after painless thyroiditis or subacute thyroiditis) or reversible (due to a drug that can be discontinued). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of therapy is restoration of the euthyroid state, which can be readily accomplished in almost all patients by oral administration of synthetic thyroxine (T4, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>).

The clinical manifestations are highly variable, depending upon the age at onset and the duration and severity of thyroid hormone deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized biochemically by a high serum TSH concentration and a normal serum free T4 concentration. Most patients are asymptomatic. The diagnosis and management of subclinical hypothyroidism are reviewed separately.

TSH may be low, normal, or even slightly elevated (up to approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. The clinical manifestations of central hypothyroidism are similar to but sometimes milder than those of primary hypothyroidism. The diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>All patients with overt primary (or central) hypothyroidism require treatment (regardless of symptoms), unless the hypothyroidism is transient (as after painless thyroiditis or subacute thyroiditis) or reversible (due to a drug that can be discontinued). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Transient hypothyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid hormone should not be prescribed to biochemically euthyroid individuals with nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight gain, depression). Thyroid hormone has been administered to euthyroid patients with several clinical problems in whom it was hoped that outcome would be improved. These include T3 therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and in those with refractory depression in an attempt to enhance the response to antidepressant drug therapy. A meta-analysis on the efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy in depressed patients was equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although there was evidence for overall benefit, the analysis limited to randomized, double-blind trials revealed no benefit of synthetic T3. In addition, T3 did not help in an open-label study of patients with severe depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Finally, T4 therapy in euthyroid patients with &quot;hypothyroid symptoms&quot; was no more effective than placebo in ameliorating symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2890829890\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amelioration of symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normalization of serum TSH secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in the size of the goiter in patients with goitrous autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis)</p><p/><p>We aim to keep serum TSH within the normal reference range (approximately 0.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. Approximately 50 percent of patients will have some decrease in goiter size, which lags behind the fall in TSH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>If a patient has possible hypothyroid symptoms and the serum TSH is confirmed by repeat measurement to be at the upper limits or above the reference range, it is reasonable to increase the dose and to aim for a serum TSH value in the lower half of the normal range. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Persistent symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>There is considerable controversy as to the appropriate upper limit of normal for serum TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Most laboratories have used values of approximately 4.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. However, others have argued that the upper limit of normal of the euthyroid reference range should be reduced to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> because 95 percent of rigorously screened, young, euthyroid volunteers have serum values between 0.4 and 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, others have reported that age-adjusted upper limits of normal for TSH should be higher than 4.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> especially for patients over age 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Until there are data demonstrating an adverse biologic impact for serum TSH values between 2.5 and 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> the wisdom of labeling such patients as hypothyroid is questionable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;, section on 'Serum TSH concentration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of choice for correction of hypothyroidism is synthetic thyroxine (T4, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>). T4 is a prohormone with very little intrinsic activity. It is deiodinated in peripheral tissues to form T3, the active thyroid hormone. This deiodination process accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total daily production of T3 in normal subjects. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of a dose of T4 is absorbed and, because the plasma half-life of T4 is long (seven days), once-daily treatment results in nearly constant serum T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations when a steady state is reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">T4 formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T4 is available in tablet, soft gel, and liquid formulations. However, currently the liquid T4 formulation is available only in Europe. Either a generic or a brand-name formulation of T4 is acceptable. The brand-name and most generic formulations are available in color-coded tablets at small increments in hormone content to allow precise titration of the dose according to the serum concentration of TSH.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tablet versus soft gel capsule</strong> &ndash; Most patients are treated with a T4 tablet. While in one study, the pharmacokinetics of the soft gel capsule were similar to tablets in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], in other studies, the soft gel capsule was less dependent upon gastric pH than a branded tablet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Thus, the soft gel capsule is an option for patients with suspected poor absorption of the standard solid tablet, especially in the presence of atrophic gastritis. However, another, less costly option is to increase the dose of a generic T4 tablet with monitoring of TSH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generic versus brand name</strong> &ndash; Either a generic or a brand-name formulation of T4 is acceptable. If a switch from one manufacturer to another is made by the pharmacy and there is concern regarding equivalent efficacy of the preparations, we measure a serum TSH six weeks after changing preparations to document that the serum TSH is still within the therapeutic target.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There has been considerable controversy about the bioequivalence of the various T4 formulations. In the past, variation in the T4 content of brand-name and generic formulations led many experts to prefer a specific preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In 1997, a study of two brand-name and two generic formulations of T4, using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended methodology for determining bioequivalence, reported that all four preparations were equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The methodology used to determine bioequivalence in the study is considered by some to be flawed since endogenous T4 concentrations were not taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the use of brand-name T4 products might be preferred theoretically to avoid the issue of variable bioavailabilities when there is interchange of different generic preparations by the pharmacy, often this is not possible, because of cost considerations. In addition, it has yet to be shown that switching among various generic manufacturers is a clinical problem.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and monitoring</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3269250293\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average full replacement dose of T4 in adults is approximately 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight per day (112 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> in a 70-kg adult), but the range of required doses is wide, varying from 50 to &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span>. T4 requirements correlate better with lean body mass than total body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The initial dose can be the full anticipated dose (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> in young, healthy patients, but older patients or those with coronary heart disease should be started on a lower dose (25 to 50 mcg daily). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Older patients or those with coronary heart disease'</a> below.)</p><p>In one prospective study of different starting doses of T4, 50 hypothyroid patients (mean age 47 years but some patients were in their 70s and 80s) were randomly assigned to receive a full starting dose of T4 (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> or T4 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> with dose adjustments every four weeks. Euthyroidism was achieved more rapidly in the full-dose group, but signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism and quality of life improved at a similar rate in the two groups. No adverse cardiac effects were seen in either group, but the subjects in the study, including the older patients, had been carefully screened to rule out cardiovascular disease prior to enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T4 should be taken on an empty stomach with water, ideally an hour before breakfast. In two small studies, espresso coffee, in comparison with water, appeared to interfere with T4 absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> tablets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] but not soft gel capsules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Few patients are able to wait a full hour before eating breakfast. One study showed higher serum T4 and lower TSH concentrations in 90 patients receiving T4 at bedtime compared with patients who took it in the morning and waited only 30 minutes before breakfast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients had nothing to eat for several hours before bedtime, suggesting the proximity to food ingestion, rather than time of day, is the more critical parameter. In other studies, serum TSH concentrations were lower and less variable with standard fasting administration of T4 than with nonfasting administration (eg, mean serum TSH 1.06&plusmn;1.23, 2.93&plusmn;3.29, and 2.19&plusmn;2.66 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> if taken one hour before breakfast, with breakfast, or at bedtime two hours after the last meal, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In another small study, there was no difference in serum TSH levels after ingestion of liquid T4 at breakfast compared with the same dose 30 minutes prior to breakfast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>T4 should not be taken with other medications that interfere with its absorption, such as bile acid resins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a>.

Although symptoms may begin to resolve after two to three weeks, steady-state TSH concentrations are not achieved for at least six weeks. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations increase first and then TSH secretion begins to fall because of the negative feedback action of T4 on the pituitary and hypothalamus.</p><p>After initiation of T4 therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with symptomatic improvement should be reevaluated and serum TSH measured in six weeks. If the TSH remains above the reference range, the dose of T4 can be increased by 12 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span>. The patient will require a repeat TSH measurement in six weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with persistent symptoms after two to three weeks should be reevaluated and a serum free T4 and TSH measured in three weeks. If the serum free T4 is below normal, the dose can be increased at three weeks without additional testing, but it should be recognized that serum T4 (and TSH) concentrations at this time are not steady-state values, and serum TSH levels may still be falling despite normal (or even high) serum T4 concentrations. Given the one-week plasma half-life of T4, it takes approximately six weeks (six half-lives) before a steady state is attained after therapy is initiated or the dose is changed.</p><p/><p>This process of increasing the dose of T4 every three to six weeks (depending upon the patient's symptoms) should continue, based upon periodic measurements of serum TSH (and free T4 if steady-state conditions have not yet been achieved), until the high values of TSH in patients with primary hypothyroidism return to the reference range.</p><p>The maintenance dose may vary according to the cause of hypothyroidism. In a study of patients receiving chronic T4 therapy who were clinically euthyroid and had serum free T4 index values within the upper half of the normal range and normal serum TSH concentration, 73 patients with hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or radioiodine therapy were receiving less T4 (118 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> than 36 patients with thyroid cancer after near-total thyroidectomy (152 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In 36 patients with central hypothyroidism and similar serum free T4 index values, the T4 dose was higher (155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span>. These results suggest that both normal amounts of TSH and the presence of residual thyroid tissue are determinants of T4 dose in patients with hypothyroidism. In general, doses &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> suggest T4 malabsorption or poor adherence to the medication regimen. (See <a href=\"#H2901704214\" class=\"local\">'Persistent elevation in TSH'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjustment of maintenance dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After identification of the proper maintenance dose, the patient should be examined and serum TSH measured once yearly or more often if there is an abnormal result or a change in the patient's status. Further dose adjustment is usually not required, but there are situations in which a different dose may be needed. When drugs that affect the absorption of T4 are begun for coexisting medical conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50439 \">table 1</a>), serum TSH should be measured four to six weeks later to confirm that the T4 dose is still adequate. The dose should be increased if the serum TSH value is high. Medications that interfere with T4 absorption should be taken several hours after the T4 dose.

Limited evidence also suggests no increase in all-cause mortality among patients with treated hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>In contrast, infants with congenital hypothyroidism in whom treatment is inadequate or delayed for several months may have permanent brain damage, even if they are adequately treated several months later.

The possibility of an inadequate current T4 dose should be verified by measuring serum TSH before the dose is increased. In addition, clinicians should evaluate for alternative causes of the symptoms.</p><p>The dose of T4 need not be altered in patients who are clinically euthyroid if their serum TSH concentration is normal or only slightly above (or below) the reference range. TSH values may be slightly high (or low) because of laboratory error or normal circadian fluctuations in TSH secretion, so a slightly high (or low) value should be confirmed with repeat measurement before the dose is changed. On the other hand, if a patient has possible hypothyroid symptoms and the serum TSH is confirmed by repeat measurement to be at the upper limits or above the reference range, it is reasonable to increase the dose and to aim for a serum TSH value in the lower half of the reference range. However, it is important to note that there is an age-related shift towards higher TSH concentrations in older patients, with an upper limit of normal of approximately 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> in 80 year olds. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;, section on 'Serum TSH concentration'</a>.)</p><p>Whether or not the dose adjustment will improve symptoms is uncertain. In one study of 697 patients on thyroid hormone replacement, psychological well-being assessed by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 correlated positively with serum free T4 and negatively with serum TSH for TSH values between 0.3 to 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. More specifically, psychological well-being was better in patients with lower serum TSH concentrations. However, in a blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, patients could not distinguish between their usual T4 dose and doses that were 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> higher, ie, they could not distinguish between TSH values that averaged 2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> from those that averaged 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism despite a normal serum TSH level may be due to inadequacy of T4 to physiologically restore tissue thyroid hormone levels to normal or to factors unrelated to thyroid dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The question of whether a subset of hypothyroid patients with persistent symptoms may benefit from substitution of some T3 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=liothyronine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liothyronine</a>) for T4 is reviewed below.

Often these patients are taking larger doses of T4 than expected. This finding may be due to poor compliance or to poor absorption of T4.</p><p>Patients with autoimmune gastritis have higher T4 requirements (tablet preparations). In one study, the T4 dose was 17 percent higher in patients with parietal cell antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A similar effect can be seen in patients with occult celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this setting, free T4 levels are typically low or low-normal. In contrast, poorly compliant patients may have free T4 concentrations that are low, normal, or high, depending on how much T4 they have taken and when they have taken it (some poorly compliant patients take extra T4 in the days leading up to the appointment with their clinician and may have a high-normal or even an elevated free T4 with a TSH that hasn't had time to fall into the normal or subnormal range).</p><p>In patients with persistently elevated TSH despite what appears to be an adequate dose of T4, it should be confirmed that T4 is taken daily on an empty stomach with water, ideally an hour before breakfast, and that medications that interfere with T4 absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50439 \">table 1</a>) are taken several hours after the T4 dose.</p><p>If the TSH remains elevated, and noncompliance is not acknowledged, adequate T4 absorption can be assessed by a T4 absorption test. Patients are administered their weight-based weekly oral dose of T4 (eg, 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight times 7), and free T4 is measured at baseline and at two hours. In one study, the average normal increase in free T4 at 120 minutes was 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Values well below this suggest malabsorption, whereas values similar to this suggest poor compliance.

Other options for patients with poor T4 absorption include increasing the dose of T4 tablets or switching to a soft gel preparation. In one study, patients who appeared to be resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> administration did not absorb T4 tablets well but absorbed T4 tablets after they were pulverized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Overreplacement causes subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal serum T4 and T3 and low serum TSH concentrations) or even overt hyperthyroidism. Atrial fibrillation is the main risk of subclinical hyperthyroidism, and it occurs three times more often in older patients with serum TSH concentrations &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> than in normal subjects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55024 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Patients with iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism, particularly postmenopausal women, may also have accelerated bone loss. It is therefore important to educate patients about the potential adverse effects of overtreatment with T4. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone disease with hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risks associated with overreplacement of thyroid hormone are greatest in those with the most suppressed TSH concentrations. This was illustrated by the findings from a cohort study of 17,684 patients taking T4 replacement therapy. Patients with TSH concentrations between 0.04 and 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> were not at risk for arrhythmias or fractures compared with those with a TSH in the normal reference range. However, patients with more severe iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis (TSH &lt;0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> had a significantly increased risk of arrhythmia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6) and fractures (HR 2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

However, a therapeutic trial using doses of T4 and T3 that attempt to mimic normal physiology (ratio T4-to-T3 of 13:1 to 16:1) while maintaining a normal TSH is an option in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H391090014\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for combined T4 and T3 therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>There is controversy as to whether T4 replacement alone can mimic normal physiology. T4 is deiodinated in peripheral tissues to form T3, the active thyroid hormone. The prohormone nature of T4 is an advantage over other thyroid hormone preparations because the patient's own physiologic mechanisms control the production of active hormone. In some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/12,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,43</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], studies, mean serum T3 concentrations were within the normal range in hypothyroid patients receiving adequate T4 therapy. In a prospective study of recently athyreotic patients receiving T4 therapy to normalize serum TSH concentrations, serum T3 concentrations on treatment were, in most, but not all cases, comparable with the patients' preoperative T3 values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, in another study, 15 percent of athyreotic patients taking T4 monotherapy had serum T3 levels below the reference range for individuals with intact thyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Some hypothyroid patients remain symptomatic in spite of T4 replacement and normal serum TSH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a large, community-based questionnaire study of patients taking T4 who had normal serum TSH concentrations, 9 to 13 percent more patients had impaired psychological well-being as compared with normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This observation raises the question of whether hypothyroid patients might benefit from substitution of some T3 for T4, an idea that has now been evaluated in multiple randomized trials, almost all of which showed that combination T4-T3 therapy does not appear to be superior to T4 monotherapy for the management of hypothyroid symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/47-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1402944\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Well-designed, blinded studies are still needed to address this ongoing controversy. The normal ratio of T4-to-T3 secretion by the thyroid gland is approximately 13:1 to 16:1 (mcg T4 to mcg T3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The majority of the randomized, controlled trials used excessive and nonphysiologic amounts of T3 when assessing combination therapy. In addition, a slow-release T3 preparation, which may avoid supraphysiologic peaks in serum T3 concentrations, is not yet commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

One analysis suggested patients with a polymorphism in the type 2 deiodinase, which converts T4 to T3, might benefit from combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Sixteen percent of the population studied had the CC genotype of the rs225014 polymorphism in the deiodinase 2 gene (<em>DIO2</em>); these patients had worse baseline quality-of-life scores and showed greater improvement after T4-T3 therapy compared with T4 alone. However, a smaller study was unable to show a difference in response to combined T4-T3 therapy based on <em>DIO2</em> genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In addition, a large population-based study showed lower health-related quality-of-life scores in levothyroxine-treated hypothyroid patients compared with controls, but this did not differ among individuals who did or did not have the rs225014 polymorphism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Some thyroidectomized patients who have no residual endogenous T3 production might derive benefit from the addition of T3.

T3 alone is available as 5 and 25 mcg tablets, so available doses utilizing half tablets are 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 mcg. When possible, the dose of T3 should be divided into morning and afternoon doses. One can calculate an optimal dose by considering that T3 is three to four times more potent metabolically than T4 and aiming for a T4-to-T3 ratio of approximately 13:1 to 16:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

TSH levels in steady-state conditions will reflect adequacy of therapy. Serum free T4 can be useful, especially in nonsteady-state conditions, in patients receiving combined T4 and T3 therapy at a physiologic ratio of 13:1 to 16:1 but may be misleading (due to low values) in patients receiving combined therapy where the ratio is low. For example, over half of patients receiving desiccated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-extract-desiccated-thyroid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thyroid extract</a> (T4:T3 ratio 4:1) will have subnormal T4 concentrations despite normal serum TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>We do not monitor T3 levels. Patients treated with currently available T3-containing preparations have wide fluctuations in serum T3 concentrations throughout the day due to its rapid gastrointestinal absorption and its relatively short half-life in the circulation (approximately one day). In fact, T3 serum levels may be elevated three to four hours after the last dose (eg, at noon if the dose is taken at 8 AM) and low if T3 is measured before the next dose. Thus, T3 measurements primarily reflect the interval since the dose was administered and should not be used for monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Converting from desiccated thyroid extract to T4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are taking desiccated thyroid, we prefer to switch them to T4.</p><p>By US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandate, 1 grain of desiccated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-extract-desiccated-thyroid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thyroid extract</a> (60 mg) should contain approximately 38 mcg T4 and 9 mcg T3. Using a conversion of 9 mcg T3 is equivalent to approximately 36 mcg T4, 1 grain would be equivalent to approximately 74 mcg T4. However, in a randomized trial comparing T4 with desiccated thyroid extract, 1 grain (60 mg) of extract was equivalent to 88 mcg of T4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Both of these conversions result in lower amounts of T4 than traditionally recommended; the United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information suggests 1 grain (60 mg) is equivalent to 100 mcg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Thus, many clinicians use a simple conversion factor of 1 grain = 100 mcg T4. For a patient who is taking 1&frac12; grains (90 mg) of desiccated thyroid, an equivalent T4 dose ranges from 112 to 150 mcg.

As an example, for a patient who is taking a preparation of 12.5 mcg T3 combined with 50 mcg T4, the equivalent dose of T4 is approximately 100 mcg (50 mcg T4 plus four times the dose of T3).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL TREATMENT SITUATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several situations in which therapy should be more conservative or the dose may need modification:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Older patients or those with coronary heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients (older than 50 or 60 years depending upon coexisting medical problems) should initially be treated with 50 mcg T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">)/day</span>.

Approximately 75 to 85 percent of women with preexisting hypothyroidism need a higher dose of T4 during pregnancy to maintain normal TSH secretion. The increase in T4 requirements occurs as early as the fifth week of gestation and plateaus by week 16 to 20. The treatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is reviewed separately.

In a study of postmenopausal women (25 women with hypothyroidism and 11 normal women) treated with 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens daily for 48 weeks, serum T4 and TBG concentrations increased in both the hypothyroid and normal women. Serum free T4 and TSH concentrations did not change in the normal women but decreased and increased, respectively, in the hypothyroid women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Among the latter, seven women had serum TSH concentrations &gt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> and were given more T4. These data suggest that serum TSH should be measured approximately 12 weeks after starting estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women receiving T4 therapy to determine if an increase in T4 dose is needed. Whether younger hypothyroid women receiving oral contraceptives require dose adjustments is uncertain. Such patients may require dose adjustments, especially when oral contraceptives are initiated because of hypoestrogenic states.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving chronic T4 therapy who undergo surgery and are unable to eat for several days need not be given T4 parenterally. If oral intake cannot be resumed in five to seven days, then T4 should be given intravenously. The dose should be approximately 70 to 80 percent of the patient's usual oral dose because that is approximately the fraction of oral T4 that is absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/12,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,71</a>].

The efficacy of this approach was evaluated in a crossover trial of 12 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The mean serum TSH concentration one week after a single weekly dose was slightly higher than when the usual dose was given daily (6.6 versus 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> but the raised value returned to normal one day after the next weekly dose.

In such a patient, a high serum TSH concentration suggests that the patient is hypothyroid, and the T4 dose should be increased accordingly. If, however, the serum TSH values are normal or low, the dose of thyroid hormone can be reduced by one-half and serum TSH measured again in four to six weeks. If the value is normal, the dose can be reduced further or stopped. Most patients with hypothyroidism have symptoms and a high serum TSH concentration within one month after discontinuing therapy.</p><p>Many of these patients are reluctant to discontinue their thyroid hormone, especially if they have taken it for many years. In this case, the goal should be to provide an appropriate dose of T4 (adjusted to maintain a normal serum TSH concentration) to avoid the potential adverse cardiac and skeletal effects of overtreatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2850979244\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

For the vast majority of patients with hypothyroidism, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using combination T4-triiodothyronine (T3) therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, T4-T3 therapy may improve symptoms in selected patients (eg, after thyroidectomy or ablative therapy with radioiodine).
