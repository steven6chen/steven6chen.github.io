Eleven to 19 percent of women will undergo surgery for prolapse or incontinence by age 80 to 85 years, and 30 percent of these women will require an additional prolapse repair procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Women with symptomatic POP experience daily discomfort, as well as interference with sexual function and exercise. Reconstructive surgery for women with prolapse consists of some combination of resuspension of the vaginal apex and anterior and posterior vaginal walls. The choice of a primary surgical procedure for women with POP depends upon a variety of considerations, including the anatomic site of prolapse, presence of urinary or fecal incontinence, health status, and patient preferences.</p><p>The process of choosing a surgical procedure for women with POP who have not had a prior prolapse repair will be reviewed here. Evaluation of women with POP, conservative management, and specific repair procedures are discussed separately.

Surgical correction of asymptomatic POP or non-bothersome POP has no known benefit and adds perioperative risks.</p><p>POP symptoms include pelvic pressure, sensation of a vaginal bulge, urinary retention, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficult defecation; some women need to reduce the prolapse using a finger in the vagina (also referred to as splinting) to urinate or defecate. Prolapsed vaginal tissue may protrude, leading to chronic discharge and bleeding from ulceration. Such symptoms may interfere with daily activities, sexual function, or exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H21524755\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Many women have asymptomatic POP; approximately 40 percent of women are found to have stage II or greater prolapse upon routine pelvic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. There is no indication for repair of asymptomatic POP as an isolated procedure. </p><p>When women undergo other pelvic procedures (eg, vaginal hysterectomy, stress urinary incontinence [SUI] surgery), some surgeons repair asymptomatic prolapse to prevent the need for subsequent surgery. This practice is based upon the assumption that prolapse will progress. This approach makes sense to patients and surgeons but remains unproven and may increase surgical morbidity. Interestingly, the natural history of prolapse does not follow a progressive course in all women. Data suggest that the course is progressive until menopause, after which the degree of prolapse may follow a course of alternating progression and regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. On the other hand, in addition to premenopausal status, risk factors for the progression of POP include obesity and hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Prolapse repair for asymptomatic women at the time of other pelvic surgery is a reasonable option in women with advanced prolapse (stages 3 or 4) or risk factors for prolapse progression (eg, concomitant hysterectomy, premenopausal status, obesity).</p><p>Combined surgical treatment of POP and SUI is discussed separately.

The mainstay of<strong> </strong>nonsurgical treatment for POP is the vaginal pessary. Pessaries are silicone devices that are inserted into the vagina and support the pelvic organs. Pelvic floor muscle exercise is another conservative treatment option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H8624710\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Conservative management'</a>.)</p><p>Prolapse is typically a chronic problem, and many women ultimately prefer surgery to conservative therapy since successful surgery does not require ongoing maintenance. In the patients who can be fit with a pessary, approximately 40 percent of women discontinue pessary use within one to two years of use. It is difficult to estimate how many women who choose to have a pessary go on to have surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-pessary-treatment-of-prolapse-and-incontinence#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal pessary treatment of prolapse and incontinence&quot;, section on 'Outcomes of pessary treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10284349\"><span class=\"h2\">Women finished with childbearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic support may be disrupted during pregnancy, and particularly following a vaginal birth. Most surgeons recommend delaying surgical management of POP until childbearing is complete. Small case studies have reported successful pregnancy after uterine-sparing surgery, but no study has specifically investigated the risk of developing recurrent POP after delivery. Seven pregnancies have been reported with one following vaginal and cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3439983\"><span class=\"h2\">Young or elderly women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at a young age are at higher risk of prolapse recurrence but lower overall risk of complications from surgery compared with older women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79651 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, procedures with longer efficacy (eg, abdominal sacral colpopexy rather than vaginal sacrospinous ligament suspension) have higher surgical risk. Thus, it is recommended, especially for younger patients, to understand that choosing procedures with higher efficacy may come at the expense of higher risk. </p><p>POP repair can be safely performed in many elderly women. In contrast with younger women, older women are at lower risk of recurrence and higher risk of complications from surgery compared with younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent a primary procedure for incontinence or prolapse, cumulative incidence of a repeat surgery for either POP or SUI was greater for women age 65 or greater compared with those under age 65 (9.9 versus 7.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a cohort of 267 patients who were &gt; or = 75 years old, 26 percent of the patients had a significant perioperative complication at the time of surgery for POP. The most common perioperative complication was blood transfusion or significant blood loss, pulmonary edema, and postoperative congestive heart failure; however, the overall perioperative morbidity rate in elderly women who undergo urogynecologic surgery is low. Independent risk factors that were predictive of a patient having a perioperative complication were the length of surgery, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10284356\"><span class=\"h2\">Obese women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although obesity is a risk factor for new onset and recurrent POP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], obese women appear to have no difference in outcome of surgical correction of apical prolapse compared with non-obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Many surgeons feel that obese patients are good candidates for the most durable repair, abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Unfortunately, the open abdominal approach in the obese patient increases the risk usually in the form of wound complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2327248\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH TO CHOICE OF PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of a primary procedure for POP includes a variety of factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstructive or obliterative &ndash; Most women with symptomatic POP are treated with a reconstructive procedure.

The choice of surgical route depends upon the optimal approach for the combination of prolapse sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant anti-incontinence surgery &ndash; Symptomatic POP often coexists with SUI and, in some women, anal incontinence. POP repair must be coordinated with treatment of incontinence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of surgical mesh &ndash; Surgical mesh is used in abdominal POP repair. Use in transvaginal procedures is based on the indication and risks and benefits for the individual woman. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop#H2852365385\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Use in pelvic organ prolapse (POP)&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p>A summary of all major decisions involved in choosing a primary surgical procedure to repair POP is presented in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56020\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56020 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2327263\"><span class=\"h1\">RECONSTRUCTIVE VERSUS OBLITERATIVE PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of a reconstructive or obliterative procedure depends upon the medical status and sexual function of the patient. </p><p>Reconstructive surgery surgically corrects the prolapsed vagina and aims to restore normal anatomy, while obliterative surgery corrects prolapse by removing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> closing off all or a portion of the vaginal canal (ie, colpocleisis or colpectomy) to reduce the viscera back into the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another difference between the two types of procedures is that reconstructive surgery can be performed using a vaginal or abdominal approach, while all obliterative surgeries are performed using the vaginal approach. </p><p>Most women with symptomatic POP are treated with a reconstructive procedure. Obliterative procedures are reserved for women who cannot tolerate more extensive surgery or who are not planning future vaginal intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The advantages of obliterative procedures in this population are that such procedures typically have a short operative duration, low risk of perioperative morbidity, and an extremely low risk of prolapse recurrence. The obvious disadvantages are the elimination of the potential for vaginal intercourse, as well as the inability to evaluate the cervix or uterus via a vaginal route (eg, cervical cytology or endometrial biopsy).</p><p>Colpocleisis is highly effective with low morbidity for correcting apical prolapse in such women. Colpocleisis does not appear to alter body image and regret after the procedure is uncommon (less than 10 percent). Therefore, an obliterative operation is an option for women who are not candidates for more extensive surgery or are willing to accept the loss of vaginal intercourse.</p><p>Obliterative procedures for POP are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-obliterative-procedures-colpocleisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Obliterative procedures (colpocleisis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2327312\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCOMITANT HYSTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy is often performed at the time of POP repair. This practice is dependent upon the surgical technique used for pelvic reconstruction and other potential benefits. On the other hand, there is concern that concomitant hysterectomy may increase the risk of some perioperative complications (eg, mesh erosion) and, additionally, an increasing number of women wish to conserve their uterus as an important component of their body image. </p><p>During POP repair, surgeons have generally performed hysterectomy rather than uterine-sparing procedures based upon several assertions: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apical prolapse is often present in women with symptomatic prolapse, and the most commonly performed techniques for apical prolapse repair require hysterectomy. In abdominal sacral colpopexy and transvaginal sacrospinous ligament suspension, hysterectomy is required because the apex is elevated by affixing the vaginal cuff to a support structure (eg, the sacrospinous ligament or the anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The common wisdom has been that retaining the uterus increases the risk of recurrent prolapse, although there are no data to support this. The role of hysterectomy at the time of surgery for POP is currently debatable and there are no data supporting hysterectomy at the time of surgery for POP. There are three underpowered studies that describe uterine preservation at the time of surgery for POP and uterine preservation did not affect the risk of POP recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy eliminates current or future cervical or intrauterine pathology. However, such benefits are less relevant with current advances in minimally invasive treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding and in cervical cancer screening. Uterine cancer typically presents at an early stage with uterine bleeding, and thus, preventive measures are not routinely recommended for average risk women.<br/><br/>In a retrospective analysis of pathology findings at reconstructive pelvic surgery with hysterectomy, over a 3.5-year period, 17 of 644 patients (2.6 percent) had unanticipated premalignant or malignant uterine pathology. Two (0.3 percent) had endometrial carcinoma. All cases of unanticipated disease were identified in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>Potential disadvantages of hysterectomy and the associated pelvic floor dissection are an increased risk of pelvic neuropathy and disruption of natural support structures such as the uterosacral cardinal ligament complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Uterine sparing procedures correct apical prolapse by attaching the lower uterus or cervix to a support structure. These techniques are not widely used, since they have not been well evaluated and most surgeons have not been trained to perform them. &#160; </p><p>Advantages of uterine sparing techniques are a shorter operative duration and less blood loss; however, their efficacy is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/24,25,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,29-32</a>]. Two randomized trials in women with stage II or higher POP that compared transvaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy with vaginal hysterectomy (with uterosacral or sacrospinous ligament suspension of the vaginal vault) yielded consistent results: the rate of prolapse recurrence after 9 to 12 months was higher in women who underwent hysteropexy in both trials, but reached statistical significance in one trial (27 versus 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]) and not the other (25 versus 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]). Operative duration (59 versus 120 minutes in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]) and blood loss (20 versus 120 mL in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]) were decreased for sacrospinous hysteropexy compared with vaginal hysterectomy; complication rates were similar for the two groups. Further study is needed to evaluate the efficacy of uterine sparing techniques.</p><p>A proposed advantage of uterine sparing surgery is a decreased impact on sexual function; however, this benefit is uncertain. The only study of this issue found no difference in effect on sexual function in women who underwent sacrospinous hysteropexy compared with vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Also, studies of hysterectomy for POP and other indications have generally found no impact on sexual function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease#H244676999\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;, section on 'Pelvic organ prolapse'</a>.)</p><p>Uterine-sparing techniques offer the potential for preserving fertility. There are few data, however, regarding the risk of intrapartum complication and postpartum recurrence of prolapse following these procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/25,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34</a>]. </p><p>While uterine sparing techniques may offer benefits of decreased operative duration and blood loss, their efficacy and decreased risk remains unproven. Given the current data, for women undergoing apical prolapse repair, we suggest performing concomitant hysterectomy rather than uterine preservation. A uterine sparing procedure performed by a surgeon familiar with the necessary techniques is a reasonable alternative for women who strongly prefer to preserve their uterus and are aware of the potential risk of recurrent prolapse requiring need for future hysterectomy and the uncertainty regarding the impact of future pregnancy on the durability of the repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2327483\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCOMITANT REPAIR OF APICAL AND ANTERIOR OR POSTERIOR PROLAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reconstructive surgery for POP often involves repair of multiple anatomic sites of prolapse (apical, anterior, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior). Repair of each prolapse site and how to best perform a combined reconstruction must be considered when choosing an overall surgical approach. The common teaching is that all procedures should be performed using one route (vaginal or abdominal), since it is generally preferred to avoid both abdominal and vaginal incisions. In some instances, however, surgeons may combine the two surgical approaches. </p><p>Choice of surgical route is mainly of concern in women who require repair of apical prolapse, since isolated repair of anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse is typically performed transvaginally (posterior prolapse can also be repaired endoanally). Repair of apical prolapse abdominally with sacral colpopexy results in a lower rate of recurrence, while transvaginal repair (eg, sacrospinous ligament fixation, uterosacral ligament fixation) has a shorter recovery and less morbidity. The choice of surgical technique for specific anatomic sites of prolapse is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-posterior-vaginal-defects#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of posterior vaginal defects&quot;, section on 'Surgical approaches'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-apical-prolapse-uterine-or-vaginal-vault-prolapse#H21188326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of apical prolapse (uterine or vaginal vault prolapse)&quot;, section on 'Abdominal versus vaginal approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Surgical repair of anterior vaginal wall prolapse&quot;</a>.).</p><p>Patients with apical prolapse are more likely to have anterior prolapse and less likely to experience posterior prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It is controversial whether repair of apical prolapse is sufficient to support the anterior and posterior vaginal walls or if additional procedures are required to address anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior prolapse. If the vaginal muscularis is well suspended at the apex, many anterior defects (55 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and some posterior defects will resolve. On the other hand, correction of anterior or posterior prolapse does <strong>not</strong> repair apical descent. The approach to concomitant repair of multiple sites of prolapse varies by surgical route and by site of prolapse.</p><p>Repair of anterior or posterior prolapse alone appears to have a higher failure rate than when these procedures are combined with apical prolapse repair. This was illustrated in United States national study of 2756 women and found the following 10-year reoperation rates: anterior repair versus combined anterior and apical repair (20.2 versus 11.6 percent); anterior and posterior repair versus combined anterior, posterior, and apical repair (14.7 versus 10.2 percent); and posterior repair versus combined posterior and apical repair (14.6 versus 12.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Hysterectomy for prolapse and the omission of appropriate prolapse repairs are risk factors for reoperation of prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The incidence of reoperation within 10 years of surgery is 7.4 percent when vaginal hysterectomy is done alone for prolapse and just 2 percent when concomitant pelvic floor repairs are undertaken at the time of hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The long-recognized importance of apical vaginal support has also been quantified in biomechanical studies.

Since it is difficult for examiners to agree on whether a paravaginal defect is present, in our practice, we do not routinely perform paravaginal defect repairs for anterior wall support and feel that a good apical suspension obviates the need for a separate repair of the anterior wall.

However, most of these studies used a definition of failure defined as recurrence of stage II or higher; new evidence suggests that this definition is too strict and has been based on expert opinion only and not data. Current evidence supports a definition of success as a patient&rsquo;s perception of bother, which typically corresponds to prolapse beyond the hymen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].
