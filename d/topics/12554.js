Skin testing is an important element in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy.</p><p>This topic review will discuss general principles of skin testing used in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy, including indications, contraindications, factors influencing results, techniques, and accuracy. The two major methods of skin testing used, the <strong><span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</strong></span> technique and the <strong>intradermal</strong> technique, are described. The use of skin testing to diagnose specific disorders is presented in the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis#H15264438\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Skin testing'</a>.)</p><p>Other forms of skin testing, such as patch testing for contact dermatitis or atopy patch testing for eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patch-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patch testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-testing-in-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22408419\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE IN DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three components to the diagnosis of an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic disorder. These are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the possible culprit allergen(s), usually through a careful clinical history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of IgE specific to the allergen(s) by skin testing or in vitro testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination that exposure to the allergen(s) results in symptoms, either by history or with a challenge procedure.</p><p/><p>Allergy testing to demonstrate allergen-specific IgE fulfills the second component and is an important element in the evaluation of allergic disease. However, a positive skin test, by itself, is <strong>not sufficient</strong> to make a diagnosis. Positive skin tests must be supported by an appropriate clinical history of reactivity and, in some cases, allergen challenge, to confirm that the suspected allergen causes symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22408426\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing and other diagnostic procedures in the field of allergy (eg, challenges) should be performed by specialists trained in the methods and interpretation of the test results. Any procedure that involves the deliberate exposure of a patient to a substance that may cause significant harm should be undertaken by someone with expertise in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. In addition, because each type of allergy has unique characteristics and implications for the patient's health, an allergy expert can be an invaluable source of information for both the patient and the primary provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14773008\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF SKIN TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing is the most rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective testing modality for the detection of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disease. The procedure lasts less than an hour with minimal patient discomfort. There are several published practice parameters for allergen skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The material in this topic is consistent with, although not identical to, these publications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14772909\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages over in vitro tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary advantages of skin testing over in vitro testing are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results are available within 15 to 20 minutes (compared with several days for in vitro tests).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most settings, skin testing is less costly than in vitro testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For an individual patient, the relative size of positive reactions gives some indication of the patient's sensitivity to specific allergens, although the sizes of positive reactions vary significantly among individuals. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting results'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients can see the reactions and this often helps them understand that they <span class=\"nowrap\">are/are</span> not allergic to a given substance. In addition, watching the swelling and erythema develop in the skin helps patients understand what happens elsewhere in the body in response to allergen exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solutions for skin testing can be made from a wide variety of allergenic inhalants, foods, and medications, whereas commercial in vitro tests are available for a more limited number of allergens. Thus, skin testing is often useful for evaluating possible allergies to unusual allergens.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing is a bioassay that detects the presence of allergen-specific IgE on a patient's mast cells. A positive reaction implies that mast cells within other target organs (ie, eyes, nose, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract) would also react upon exposure to that allergen.</p><p>When allergen is introduced into the skin of a patient during skin testing, it comes into contact with cutaneous mast cells. Binding of the allergen occurs if the patient's mast cells are coated with IgE recognizing that specific allergen. If both IgE and allergen are present in sufficient quantities, then adjacent IgE molecules directed against the allergen may be crosslinked on the cell surface and initiate intracellular signaling.</p><p>These events lead to mast cell activation, release of the contents of intracellular granules (degranulation), and the de novo generation of inflammatory mediators. Degranulation releases preformed vasoactive mediators and enzymes, such as histamine, tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase. Histamine is the major mediator of the wheal and flare response, but other mediators (eg, prostaglandin D2) are also involved, as the size of the wheal does not correlate directly with the concentrations of histamine released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The clinical result of these cellular events is a positive skin test or a transient &quot;wheal-and-flare&quot; reaction. This reaction consists of a localized central area of superficial skin edema (wheal) surrounded by erythema (flare). This pruritic reaction represents the immediate phase of the allergic reaction.</p><p>Late-phase reactions (LPRs) may develop at skin test sites in some individuals. These consist of deep tissue swelling, warmth, pruritus, and erythema beginning one to two hours after testing and resolving in 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. LPRs are mast cell mediated and IgE dependent, although they do <strong>not</strong> predict symptoms on exposure and are not used in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14772959\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitization versus clinical allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person with demonstrable IgE to a specific allergen is said to be &quot;sensitized&quot; to that allergen. Both skin testing and in vitro testing are used to demonstrate IgE sensitization. However, a sensitized person is considered &quot;allergic&quot; to an allergen only if they react with representative symptoms when exposed to it.</p><p>This distinction is made because not all sensitized patients will develop actual symptoms on exposure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With some food skin tests, for example, only about 50 percent of positive tests are true positives. Thus, food challenge procedures are often necessary to clarify a patient's allergic status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By comparison, the proportion of individuals with positive pollen skin tests who react to inhalation of that pollen is much higher. Therefore, a positive skin test and a history of symptoms during the appropriate season are sufficient to make the diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Thus, the confirmation of reactivity is crucial to making an accurate diagnosis and this is more important for certain types of allergy (eg, food) than for others. The relationship between sensitization and clinical allergy is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease#H1366636\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The relationship between IgE and allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing is useful in the diagnosis of a variety of allergic disorders that involve immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type I immediate reactions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic asthma, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis</strong> &ndash; Skin testing using panels of indoor and outdoor allergens is the primary diagnostic modality for these conditions and is well validated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food allergy</strong> &ndash; Skin testing is considered the primary diagnostic technique for a variety of food allergies, although in vitro testing is also well validated for several childhood food allergies. In a small number of clinical settings, the results of skin testing may be accurate enough to circumvent the need for food challenges to confirm the diagnosis, although in many cases, challenge procedures are still needed if a definite diagnosis is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Accuracy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Some medication allergies</strong> &ndash; Skin testing is used in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated drug allergies. However, it has been validated and standardized only for the evaluation of penicillin allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For allergies to other medications, including other antibiotics, biologicals, chemotherapy agents, insulin, and drugs used in anesthesia, skin testing is often used as part of the evaluation, but the significance of a positive or negative result is not as well defined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venom allergies</strong> &ndash; For allergy to the venoms of Hymenoptera species (wasps, honey bees, yellow jackets, hornet, imported fire ants, and others), skin testing is the diagnostic test of choice and is well validated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Hymenoptera venom allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Latex allergy</strong> &ndash; Skin testing can be used to evaluate for latex allergy and biologically-standardized extracts of latex allergen for skin prick testing are commercially available in the European Union and Canada, although not in the United States. Some allergists produce their own extracts for testing, although the concentration of allergens in these preparations can vary dramatically and the protein content should be measured and standardized to avoid systemic reactions. The diagnosis of latex allergy is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latex allergy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14772871\"><span class=\"h2\">General versus focused testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing may be very focused or more general, based upon the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A focused approach is most appropriate for patients whose history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination strongly indicates the identity of the specific offending allergen(s). As an example, a patient who developed urticaria and wheezing while taking penicillin would be evaluated with tests for IgE specific to penicillin and its immediate derivatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A broader approach is used for patients with perennial rhinitis and asthma symptoms. In this setting, it would be appropriate to test with a selected panel of outdoor and indoor allergens pertinent to the geographical region:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tree, grass, and weed pollens, with choices reflecting regional flora.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Molds, including Alternaria alternata, Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cladosporium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dust mites, including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae, and cockroach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Animal danders, including cat pelt and dog epithelium.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing should <strong>not</strong> routinely be performed in patients who are at high risk for an anaphylactic reaction to testing, have experienced a recent anaphylactic event, are taking medications that may interfere with the treatment of anaphylaxis, or have certain skin conditions. Rates of systemic reactions to skin testing are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6476491\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">High risk for anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are at higher risk for an anaphylactic reaction in response to skin testing include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with poorly-controlled asthma and reduced lung function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with clinical histories of severe reactions to minute amounts of allergen.</p><p/><p>In vitro allergy testing should be the initial diagnostic modality in such patients, or in the case of uncontrolled asthma, skin testing can be performed after symptoms have been stabilized.</p><p>Relative contraindications to skin testing include significant cardiovascular disease (including active angina and cardiac arrhythmias), frail health in older adults, and pregnancy, because patients with these conditions (or in the case of pregnancy, the fetus) are at greater risk for adverse effects from anaphylaxis and its treatment, were it to occur. However, in such patients, there may be situations in which the benefits of the information gained from skin testing outweigh the risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Recent anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An episode of anaphylaxis within the previous month is a contraindication to skin testing because it may yield falsely-negative results. Anaphylaxis can render the skin temporarily nonreactive. Full restoration of reactivity can take two to four weeks. However, if skin testing needs to be performed earlier than one month, positive results are still useful.</p><p>In situations in which rapid diagnosis is necessary, in vitro allergen testing, if available for the allergen in question, can be performed instead. Free allergen-specific IgE in the serum is less affected by recent anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with certain skin conditions cannot be skin tested because false-positive results are common. These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermographism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or chronic urticaria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous mastocytosis</p><p/><p>Skin test results are also difficult to interpret in patients with atopic dermatitis affecting the areas where testing is performed, both because of changes in skin cellularity and the application of topical medications. However, patients with atopic dermatitis can be skin tested normally if the tests are applied to unaffected areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of skin testing are influenced by various factors, including medications and physiologic characteristics of the patient, as well as the source of allergen and skin test device used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications that should be discontinued</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's full medication list should be reviewed in advance of testing. Several types of medications can interfere with skin testing, although only some are routinely discontinued.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H1 antihistamines can suppress skin reactivity for one to seven days, depending upon the specific drug. First-generation nonselective antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clemastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clemastine</a>) generally suppress skin reactivity for one to three days, whereas second-generation antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>) may blunt skin tests for up to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. A general approach is to discontinue all antihistamines for one week prior to testing. It is important to recognize that if a patient has not withheld antihistamines for the full recommended time, that interference can still be present even though the histamine reaction is positive. In some cases, residual antihistamines will reduce the histamine control response, but completely negate the response to allergens. Thus, if a weak positive response to the histamine control or responses to allergens are unexpectedly negative, a longer medication-free period and repeat testing are suggested. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamine nasal sprays, which can become absorbed systemically, should be withheld for three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study of antihistamine eye drops found no effect on skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, because other ophthalmologic medications can be systemically absorbed, we suggest caution and ask our patients to withhold these agents for three days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamines used for nonallergic diseases, such as phenothiazine antiemetics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=promethazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">promethazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>) or agents given for <span class=\"nowrap\">vertigo/motion</span> sickness or insomnia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meclizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxylamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxylamine</a>) may block skin reactivity for up to two weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H2 receptor antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>) are generally discontinued at least 48 hours before testing, as these medications may reduce the skin reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of topical glucocorticoids for longer than one week can partially suppress responses to both allergens and histamine in treated areas of skin by locally reducing the number of skin mast cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

Because antidepressants are difficult for patients to discontinue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have long half-lives, testing is often done despite them, especially if the dose is relatively low. However, interference must be considered if a weak or negative skin response is obtained. In such patients, assessment of allergen-specific IgE in serum may be preferable. In contrast, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, dapoxetine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, do not affect skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited data concerning topical calcineurin inhibitors are conflicting.

In most cases, standardized extracts are preferred when available. The major inhalant allergens (eg, grasses, dust mites, ragweed) are well characterized and some are standardized in potency units (eg, grasses, dust mites, ragweed).</p><p>In contrast, most commercially-available food extracts are not standardized. However, extracts of milk, eggs, peanuts, soy, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts are reliable. In contrast, commercial extracts of fruits and vegetables are sometimes inadequate because the responsible allergen may be labile and altered during processing. Thus, in the event of a negative skin test for these foods, or when there is suspicion that the allergenicity of the food depends on its preparation (raw versus cooked), the fresh food should be used for skin testing using the &quot;prick-by-prick&quot; method. (See <a href=\"#H24780027\" class=\"local\">'Prick-by-prick testing with fresh food'</a> below.)</p><p>Conversely, false-positive results can arise from naturally-occurring histamine and other vasoactive amines in some allergen extracts (ie, insect venoms, molds, foods) as extracts produced in the United States are not dialyzed to remove histamine, which may occur as a natural contaminant, or from cross-reactivity with clinically-irrelevant proteins. An example of the latter phenomenon can occur in foods containing the profilin protein Bet v 2, which can cause positive skin tests to foods in birch-allergic patients without symptoms of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

If these issues are suspected, repeating the test in one or more volunteers to assure that the test is negative in others is sometimes required.

Careful consideration of the device used is of particular importance in research settings. As an example, multiheaded devices (those that allow for application of several antigens simultaneously) produce more false negatives than single-headed devices, and the inner heads may produce weaker responses than the heads on the corners of the devices. However, multiheaded devices can be very useful when testing children by allowing rapid application of multiple antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/38,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42-44</a>].

The allergens relevant to human-allergic disease are usually either glycoproteins and lipoproteins from other living organisms, or in the case of some drug and occupational allergens, a combination of small chemical moieties conjugated (or &quot;haptenated&quot;) to serum proteins. Hundreds of clinically-significant allergens have been identified from tree, grass, and weed pollens, molds, dust mites, foods, parasites, animal danders, insect venoms, drugs, occupational chemicals, and other biologic materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. At this time, the commercially-prepared allergens used in clinical practice are obtained almost exclusively from natural sources. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-extracts-composition-manufacture-and-labeling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen extracts: Composition, manufacture, and labeling&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, the more important allergenic proteins from a given substance have been identified, cloned, sequenced, and produced through recombinant technology. However, recombinant allergens do not necessarily reproduce the clinical response observed to natural allergens. Allergens from natural sources are heterogeneous. Individual allergic patients can be sensitive to different allergens from the same source, and can even respond differently to isoallergens that are identical except for minor differences in primary amino acid composition or substituted side chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, although recombinant allergens offer the advantages of being readily available and uniform in composition, they may not be appropriate in all settings. Recombinant allergens are used for both testing and treatment in Europe, although they are still limited to research applications in the United States.

Standardized allergenic extracts labeled by potency units, such as bioequivalent allergy units (BAU) should be used at the recommended strength per package insert. Each droplet contains a single allergen extract, although for screening purposes, mixes of closely-related allergens (eg, four tree pollens) are sometimes used. One of a number of commercially-available test devices are then used to prick through the droplets of allergen. Tests should be placed at least 2 centimeters apart to avoid overlapping reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The earlier &quot;scratch&quot; method of skin testing, in which allergen was placed on the skin and then a lancet or needle was used to make a linear excoriation in the skin, is rarely used, as the technique is more traumatic to the skin, variable in performance, and carries a higher risk of systemic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h4\">Controls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both a positive control of histamine dichloride (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> for epicutaneous use) and a negative control of diluent identical to that of the allergen extracts (usually glycerinated saline) should always be applied in order to verify that the patient's skin is normally responsive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h4\">Definition of a positive test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive reaction appears as a raised wheal with surrounding erythema.

This is often done to evaluate allergies to fruits, many of which occur only if the fruit is eaten in the raw form. To perform this, the food and the patient's skin are both cleaned, and the test device is used to prick first the food and then the patient's skin. If a positive test is obtained using this method, the test should be repeated on a nonallergic individual, to assure that the result is not a false-positive irritant response.

Skin testing is a diagnostic tool used in the second component. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive skin test, in isolation, is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of allergy, as it must also be demonstrated that the patient develops symptoms on exposure to that allergen. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing is a bioassay that detects the presence of allergen-specific IgE on the surface of a patient's cutaneous mast cells. Allergen is pricked into the skin and if allergen-specific IgE is present on the patient's mast cells, the cells are activated and produce localized pruritus, swelling, and erythema. Skin testing should be performed by an allergy expert, as there is a small, but definite risk of inducing an allergic reaction. (See <a href=\"#H14773008\" class=\"local\">'Overview of skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The allergic diseases for which skin testing is useful in diagnosis include allergic asthma, rhinitis and conjunctivitis, food allergy, some medication allergies, some venom allergies, and depending on the availability of testing reagents, latex allergy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing is contraindicated in patients who are at high risk for an anaphylactic reaction to testing, have experienced a recent anaphylactic event, are taking medications that may interfere with the treatment of anaphylaxis, or have certain skin conditions. Such patients should undergo in vitro allergy testing instead. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of skin testing are influenced by medications, physiologic characteristics of the patient, the device used, and the allergen extract used. Antihistamines must be discontinued prior to testing. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The allergens relevant to human disease are mostly proteins from other living organisms that are able to trigger the formation of IgE in genetically-susceptible individuals. Allergens for testing are obtained from natural sources and are heterogeneous. Efforts are underway to standardize their production around the world. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Allergen preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two commonly used methods of skin testing for IgE-mediated disorders: <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> and intradermal. <span class=\"nowrap\">Prick/puncture</span> is performed first and is sensitive but not very specific. Intradermal testing is more sensitive, although false positives are common and it carries a higher risk of inducing an allergic reaction. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing methods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Prick/puncture</span> skin testing has low specificity if all allergens are considered together. However, sensitivity and specificity are both excellent with standardized, high potency extracts, such as pollen extracts. In addition, the negative-predictive value of skin prick testing with certain allergens (eg, inhalants and foods) is very high and skin testing can exclude allergy with relative certainty. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prick/puncture method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intradermal tests are usually performed following <strong>negative</strong> <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> tests, and are approximately 100- to 1000-fold more sensitive. Intradermal testing is not performed in the diagnosis of food or latex allergy, due to an unacceptably high rate of both false positives and systemic reactions to testing. In contrast, intradermal testing is important in the diagnosis of drug and insect venom allergies. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Intradermal method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4019634848\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Hendrik Nolte, MD, PhD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bernstein IL, Storms WW.
