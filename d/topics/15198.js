Over 85 percent of patients had at least one CHD risk factor. After adjustment for age and other clinical risk factors, there was a statistically significant inverse increase in risk between the number of CHD risk factors and in-hospital mortality (odds ratios of 1.54, 1.39, 1.30, 1.10, 1.09, and 1.00 with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 risk factors, respectively).

After adjustment for patient and treatment characteristics, the hazard ratios for mild and moderate renal insufficiency were greatest at one month and gradually declined, no longer being significant at one year. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar observations were made in an analysis from the VALIANT trial of 14,527 patients with an acute MI (two-thirds with STEMI) complicated by heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This can be a source of error because the formulas used for calculation of the creatinine clearance and the estimated GFR require stable values over time, which might not be present in patients with an acute coronary syndrome.

This was illustrated in a study of 1045 patients (52 percent with a known STEMI) evaluated two months after an acute MI in which 78 (7 percent) had intermittent claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At 26 months of follow-up, those with claudication were five times more likely to have a fatal cardiac event than those without claudication (19.2 versus 3.6 percent). The patients with claudication were older and more likely to have a history of diabetes, a prior MI, a stroke, or diminished left ventricular function. Even when these comorbidities were taken into account, patients with claudication had a significantly higher incidence of cardiac death (hazard ratio 6.57).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3527271729\"><span class=\"h2\">Low BMI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have identified low body mass index (BMI) as a predictor of poor outcome after MI. As an example, a cohort study of over 57,000 patients with MI found that underweight patients had a significant 13 percent higher adjusted risk of 30-day death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Patients presenting with Killip class II or III HF complicating an acute MI tend to be older and are more often female; they also have higher rates of comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Patients with HF are also less likely to receive therapies of known efficacy in acute MI, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, heparin, beta blockers, statins, fibrinolytic agents, and angioplasty, despite evidence that these therapies are beneficial in this patient subset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The higher the Killip class on presentation, the greater the subsequent mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-17</a>]. A study from the Second National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI-2) included 190,518 patients with acute MI, of whom 36,303 (19 percent) had Killip class II or III HF on admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These patients had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those without HF (21.4 versus 7.2 percent). Similar findings were noted in an analysis of international data on 4830 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from the GRACE registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Sixteen percent had Killip class II or III HF on admission; patients with HF had increased mortality in-hospital (17 versus 4 percent) as well as from discharge to six months (20 versus 3 percent). In this report, HF developing after admission was associated with an even higher in-hospital mortality (18 percent).</p><p>The Killip class is prognostically important in patients who undergo fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>] or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (angioplasty with or without stenting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In one series of 1548 patients undergoing primary angioplasty, increasing Killip class was associated with increasing mortality at one year, an association that appears to have been due to a higher incidence of suboptimal myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The reported incidence of new onset (no prior history) AF within 48 hours of MI is 6.7 to 7.8 percent in large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

AF developed in 729 (218 within two days, 119 between days 3 and 30, and 392 after 30 days) with a cumulative incidence of 19 percent at five years (incidence rate of 42 per 1000 person-years). During a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, the development of AF was independently associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.77, 95% CI 3.37-4.21). The magnitude of this risk was associated with the time of development of AF (HR 1.63 for AF within two days, 1.81 for AF between 3 and 30 days, and 2.58 for AF &gt;30 days). An increased risk of long-term mortality was also noted in a study of more than 2300 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (37 percent with ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]; 19 percent with AF) cared for between 1995 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].
