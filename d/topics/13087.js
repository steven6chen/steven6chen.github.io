Salmonellae are facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and usually enter the body via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where they can persist for long periods of time. Salmonellae can act as both commensals and pathogens and are found in the GI tracts of domestic and wild animals, including insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals.</p><p>Although there are many types of <em>Salmonella</em>, they can be divided into two broad categories: those that cause typhoid and enteric fever and those that primarily induce gastroenteritis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em>, such as <em>Salmonella </em>Typhi or <em>Salmonella </em>Paratyphi primarily colonize humans, are transmitted via the consumption of fecally contaminated food or water, and cause a systemic illness usually with little or no diarrhea.

It can also be acquired via the fecal-oral route, either from other humans or farm or pet animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The bacterial and host factors that contribute to <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80734\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80734 \">figure 1</a>). The approach to patients with <em>Salmonella</em> in a stool culture is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Gastrointestinal infection and carriage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different serovars of <em>Salmonella</em> cause human infection. The source of infection typically is from food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2000-plus serovars of <em>Salmonella</em> can be characterized by three major antigens: the somatic O antigen, which is derived from the LPS cell wall component; the flagellar H antigen, and the surface Vi antigen. The O-antigen is widely used by clinical laboratories to divide <em>Salmonella</em> into serogroups A, B, C1, C2, D, and E (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81462 \">table 1</a>). Significant cross-reactivity can occur between serogroups. The serogroups cannot be used to divide enteric fever-causing strains from gastroenteritis-causing strains: group D contains both <em>Salmonella enteritidis</em> and <em>S. </em>Typhi, while group B contains <em>Salmonella </em>Typhimurium as well as some strains of <em>S. </em>Paratyphi. To investigate a possible outbreak, further identification must be done with bacteriophage typing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and plasmid profile determination.</p><p>The host specificity of different <em>Salmonella</em> serotypes often determines the nature of the clinical illness. Classic typhoid or enteric fever is caused by <em>S. </em>Typhi and <em>S. </em>Paratyphi. These strains are highly adapted for humans and do not colonize or cause disease in animals, though <em>S. </em>Paratyphi has very rarely been associated with domestic animals (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-enteric-typhoid-and-paratyphoid-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever&quot;</a>). Those serotypes which cause enteric fever are frequently not associated with significant diarrheal symptoms, although enteric fever may be heralded by transient diarrhea prior to the onset of fever.</p><p><em>S. enteritidis</em> and <em>S. </em>Typhimurium have broad host ranges and may produce colonization or gastroenteritis in humans, mice, and fowl (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;</a>). These serotypes are most frequently associated with gastroenteritis in humans because of the large reservoirs of bacteria in domestic animals. <em>Salmonella choleraesuis</em> (adapted for swine) and <em>Salmonella dublin </em>(adapted for cattle) are associated with human septicemia and metastatic foci of infection but are uncommon causes of gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>Salmonella gallinarum-pullorum </em>(adapted for fowl) causes relatively transient illness in humans only after very large inocula are ingested. The molecular bases of these species specificities is complex and currently under investigation.</p><p>The epidemiology of <em>Salmonella</em> has evolved over time. During the 2000s, the incidence of <em>S. </em>Typhimurium decreased, while serotypes Newport, Mississippi, and Javiana increased in incidence. Specific control programs focusing on contaminated eggs might have led to the reduction of <em>S. enteritidis</em> infections. Rates of antibiotic resistance among several serotypes have been increasing and are an area of significant concern; a substantial proportion of <em>S. </em>Typhimurium and <em>Salmonella newport</em> isolates are multidrug-resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are an estimated two to four million cases of Salmonellosis per year in the United States, with gastroenteritis as the most common clinical presentation. Nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> account for 9.7 percent of all bacterial foodborne illnesses and 30.6 percent of deaths as of 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; between the time periods 1996 to 1998 and 2005, the number of <em>Salmonella</em> cases decreased by 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis usually results from improperly handled food. It can also be acquired via the fecal-oral route, either from other humans or farm or pet animals. In the United States, serotypes Typhimurium, <em>Enteritidis</em>, and <em>Newport</em> are the most common serotypes. During 2006, large multistate outbreaks of Salmonellosis were linked to consumption of tomatoes, fruit salad, pet turtles, and peanut butter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that 1 in 10,000 egg yolks is infected with <em>Salmonella </em>enteritidis. In 1976, there were 0.6 cases of <em>S. enteritidis</em> per 100,000; by 1996 there were 3.6 cases per 100,000, with the majority of the increase due to eggs. A recent risk assessment model for <em>S. enteritidis</em> infection in eggs estimates that of the approximately 69 billion eggs produced annually, 2.3 million would be contaminated with <em>S. enteritidis</em> and that an average of 661,633 human illnesses would develop from their consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An estimated 94 percent of these cases recover without medical care, 5 percent visit a clinician, an additional 0.5 percent are hospitalized, and 0.05 percent result in death.</p><p>A multistate outbreak of <em>S. newport</em> from imported mangos was felt to be related to hot water treatment of the fruit to prevent importation of the Mediterranean fruit fly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While fruit skin usually acts as a physical barrier to pathogens, the heating and cooling of the fruit may have created an inward hydrostatic force that allowed for the entry of <em>S. newport</em>. There have been numerous other outbreaks, some of which are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-microbiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Microbiology and epidemiology&quot;</a>). The incidence of salmonellosis is highest during the summer in temperate climates (eg, from May to October in the Northern hemisphere) and during the rainy season in tropical climates, which coincides with the peak in foodborne outbreaks.</p><p>Exotic pets may be a source of salmonellosis. Approximately 90 percent of reptiles carry <em>Salmonella</em>. Cases of salmonellosis in infants have been reported in households in which iguanas, bearded dragons, or snakes were handled by adults with probable subsequent spread to the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An estimated 3 to 5 percent of all cases of salmonellosis in humans is due to exposure to pets, including turtles, birds, rodents, dogs, and cats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-dogs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from dogs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from cats&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoonoses-from-pets-other-than-dogs-and-cats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zoonoses from pets other than dogs and cats&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the number of <em>Salmonella</em> organisms required for clinical illness have been obtained from studies on human volunteers and outbreaks in which the vehicle of inoculation was quantitatively cultured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Several general statements about infectious doses can be made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large inocula (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>) produce higher rates of illness after shorter incubation periods than small inocula (&le;10<sup>3</sup>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic excretion may occur after ingestion of small inocula, although even very small inocula (5 to 100 organisms) may cause disease in susceptible hosts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic use can reduce the infectious dose necessary to cause disease by diminishing the normally protective indigenous flora (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infectious dose is lower in patients with clinical conditions associated with a reduction in gastric acidity such as neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], achlorhydric states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], gastric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], and the use of antacids or H2 blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water supplies are contaminated at lower levels than food, resulting in lower attack rates and longer incubation periods in waterborne outbreaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Salmonella </em>may persist for months in cheese, frozen meat, or ice cream.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors related both to the pathogen and the host influence the pathogenesis of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Interaction of Salmonellae with enteric host defenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ingested microorganisms must traverse the acidic barrier of the stomach in order to establish enteric infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51300\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51300 \">table 2</a>). Although <em>Salmonella</em> and other enteric pathogens survive poorly at the very low pH encountered in the stomach, <em>Salmonella</em> exhibit increased tolerance to &quot;acid shock&quot; if first exposed to a moderately acidic environment (pH 4 to 5). The organism's ability to adapt to low pH has been called the acid tolerance response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Salmonellae that survive passage through the stomach must then compete with the normal intestinal microbial flora. The indigenous flora is an important but often overlooked barrier to infection with enteric pathogens. Elegant mouse studies performed in the 1960s showed that a single injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> reduced the oral infectious dose of <em>S. </em>Typhimurium by over 100,000-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Studies in animals have shown that the protective effect of indigenous microbes is due to a variety of factors including competition for nutrients, maintenance of a low luminal pH, and production of inhibitory compounds such as volatile fatty acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>These findings appear to be applicable to humans, as can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy increases the frequency of salmonellosis among travelers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients found to be infected during an outbreak of multidrug-resistant <em>S. </em>Typhimurium enteritis used antimicrobials in the month before the onset of illness much more frequently than controls (30 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A similar association with prior antimicrobial use was noted in a multistate outbreak of illness caused by <em>Salmonella havana</em> which was pansensitive to antimicrobial agents (30 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The association persisted even when controlled for the presence of underlying illness or immunosuppression.</p><p/><p><em>S. </em>Typhimurium has a marked and unique growth advantage over other bacteria when using a specific nutrient, ethanolamine, which is released from host tissue in the lumen of the inflamed intestine and is not utilizable by competing bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, by inducing intestinal inflammation, <em>S. </em>Typhimurium sidesteps nutritional competition and creates a significant survival advantage for itself.</p><p>In addition to competition from the indigenous bacterial flora, <em>Salmonella</em> must withstand a gamut of enteric defenses including bile salts, pancreatic enzymes, Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and secretory IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of adherence and invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main components to <em>Salmonella</em> infection of the GI tract: adherence and subsequent invasion. Adherence is complex and is mediated by multiple genes. Fimbriae are very important in adhering to and adapting to a eukaryotic cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; several fimbrial operons may facilitate adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Biofilms may play a role as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The invasion operon (inv) can also induce adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Invasion may be achieved by several different mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Salmonella</em> can selectively attach to specialized epithelial cells overlying Peyer's patches in the colon known as M (microfold) cells. These cells are an important portal of entry of Salmonellae and other pathogens into the submucosal lymphoid system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. M cells are highly endocytic and can rapidly transfer material from their luminal side to their basal side, where the T cells and antigen-presenting cells reside, ready to elicit an immune response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It has been suggested that the cells of the columnar epithelium may also be an important common portal of entry for <em>Salmonella</em>, particularly since they greatly outnumber the M cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salmonellae can also induce nonphagocytic cells such as enterocytes to internalize them. This process of bacterial-mediated endocytosis has been extensively studied in vitro and appears to be important in the pathogenesis of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasion can also occur via the dendritic cells that intercalate between epithelial cells by extending protrusions into the gut lumen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous small foci of solitary intestinal lymphoid tissues (SILTs) with a strong inflammatory response can be found in the murine small intestine; <em>Salmonella</em> can be observed within these SILTs at early stages of infection, and the SILTs may act as portals of entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>Following invasion into the cell, the bacteria remain within a modified phagosome known as the <em>Salmonella</em>-containing vacuole (SCV), within which they will survive and replicate. Type III secretion systems are used to translocate bacterial effector proteins into the host cell, mediating both invasion and vacuole biogenesis. Vacuole biogenesis is a complex and dynamic process involving extensive membrane remodeling, interactions with the endolysosomal pathway, actin rearrangements, and microtubule-based movement and tubule extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms of persistent <em>Salmonella</em> fecal shedding of <em>Salmonella</em> are under investigation. The shdA gene, which encodes an outer membrane autotransporter protein that binds fibronectin, is required for persistent shedding of <em>S. </em>Typhimurium in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This raises the question of whether this locus might mediate adherence of <em>Salmonella</em> at other clinically important structures known to be foci of metastatic infection, such as arteries and bone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenicity islands</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two <em>Salmonella</em> &quot;pathogenicity islands&quot; (SPI) have been found, termed SPI-1 and 2, each about 40 kilobases of DNA and located at centrosomes 63 and 30 of the chromosome, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>]. Both SPIs encode multiple virulence factors, including Type III secretions systems (TTSS). The TTSS creates a hypodermic needle-like apparatus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69640 \">figure 2</a>) and injects proteins into the cells, facilitating uptake of the bacteria into those cells. SPI-1 encodes genes needed for nonphagocytic cell invasion via a ruffling mechanism and initiation of intestinal secretory and inflammatory responses. SPI-2 is induced within the cell and contains genes needed for survival and replication within macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some of these genes induce secretory and inflammatory responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Some of these genes on SPI-1 encode proteins homologous to <em>Shigella</em> proteins which direct the export and translocation of signaling molecules capable of interacting with eukaryotic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The secreted proteins of both <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Shigella</em> induce ruffled projections in eukaryotic cell membranes which subsequently invaginate and internalize the invading bacterium within a membrane bound vacuole, called macropinocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H440124159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.) </p><p>These TTSSs facilitate bacterial entry, replication within cells, and target cell transcriptional reprogramming via effector proteins that, although highly conserved across different serovars, have enough differences to explain variations in clinical presentations. Analyzing transcriptional responses of cultured epithelial cells infected with&nbsp;<em>S</em>. Typhi and&nbsp;<em>S</em>. Typhimurium, studies have found serovar-specific transcriptional fingerprints that correlated with activation of specific signal transduction pathways and effector proteins, which may help explain the variations in the pathogenic mechanisms and clinical illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Mutants lacking these genes display reduced virulence. In one study avirulent environmental isolates of <em>Salmonella senftenberg</em> and <em>Salmonella litchfield</em> contained deletions in SPI-1, while clinical isolates of the same serotypes retained the gene cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory response mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to facilitating their own uptake, virulent strains of <em>Salmonella </em>are able to induce migration of subepithelial neutrophils across polarized epithelial cells in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A substantial neutrophil infiltration into the intestine occurs in <em>S. </em>Typhimurium-induced colitis in humans; whether this is due to effectors from <em>Salmonella</em> or innate pathways of inflammation triggered by pathogen recognition receptors on cells in the lamina propria is a matter of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The paracellular traffic of neutrophils has been hypothesized to induce diarrhea by causing paracellular fluid and electrolyte fluxes. This theory is supported by the observation that strains which do not usually cause enteritis, such as <em>S. </em>Typhi and <em>S. gallinarum</em>, also do not induce neutrophil transmigration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In addition to IL-8, <em>Salmonella</em> induce other proinflammatory cytokines such as GM-CSF, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in colonic epithelial cells, which in turn mediate further immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Macrophages respond to <em>S. </em>Typhimurium infection via flagellin-mediated activation of Ipaf, a NACHT-leucine-rich repeat family member that activates caspase-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Activated caspase-1 is required for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18, and is important in host defense against a variety of pathogens; caspase-1-deficient mice are more susceptible to several pathogens including, <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Listeria</em>, and <em>Francisella tularensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>], as well as <em>Salmonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Lipid A is the biologically active component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in the cell wall of <em>Salmonella</em> and other gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is toxic to mammalian cells and is a potent immunomodulator. Certain features of the lipid A in <em>Salmonella</em> may correlate with virulence or with activation of host inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Lipid A induces toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated responses, which are important for host defense against <em>Salmonella</em> infection, and modifications in lipid A as part of <em>Salmonella</em>'s adaptation to host environments reduce this signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Death in mice from <em>Salmonella</em> may be related to the toxic effect of lipid A, which triggers further production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. <em>S. </em>Typhimurium mutants with a defective lipid A molecule have greatly attenuated virulence in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Structural modifications of lipid A are influenced by the <em>Salmonella</em> virulence regulatory locus <span class=\"nowrap\">(phoP/phoQ)</span> which responds to a variety of host intracellular environmental signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. For example, antimicrobial peptides have been shown to be part of the first step in signal transduction across the bacterial membrane, resulting in activation of phoQ and promotion of bacterial virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. PhoP has also been found to bind a promoter region of a drug efflux system, thus connecting virulence with possible drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Enterotoxins may also play a role in <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis. An enterotoxin, encoded by the stn gene and antigenically similar to cholera toxin has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. While many Salmonellae carry the stn gene, only a fraction express the gene, as assessed by CHO cell assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Additional characterization of the enterotoxin is needed to assess its role in human pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival within phagocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salmonellae have long been known to persist within the reticuloendothelial system. Macrophages may be the main cell type to support bacterial growth in vivo, and this growth is regulated by both the host and the <em>Salmonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The ability of <em>Salmonella</em> to survive within macrophages contributes to the dissemination of the microorganism from the submucosa to the circulation and the reticuloendothelial system. Intracellular bacterial growth within phagocytes is limited by mechanisms requiring reactive oxygen intermediates, reactive nitrogen intermediates, lysosomal enzymes, and defensins. Both the <span class=\"nowrap\">phoP/phoQ</span> virulence regulatory locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>] and the SPI-2 contain genes that are important for survival within macrophages. The importance of this process is illustrated by studies that showed that <span class=\"nowrap\">phoP/phoQ-deleted</span> <em>S. </em>Typhimurium, when used as a vaccine vector, caused no bacteremia or late sequelae in a limited number of subjects who received a large oral inoculum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Isolates of <em>S. </em>Typhimurium that are unable to survive within macrophages in vitro are avirulent in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of virulence plasmids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontyphoidal Salmonellae also carry a variety of virulence plasmids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. A highly conserved 8 kilobase region of DNA contained within these plasmids has been associated with the ability of strains to induce bacteremia and persist within the reticuloendothelial system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. <em>S. </em>Typhimurium has a self-transmissible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>] 90 kilobase virulence plasmid that contains the genes spvRABCD and while it increases the growth rate of Salmonellae in macrophages, it may have a limited contribution to virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The virulence plasmid stimulates IL-12 production in a mouse model, which may lead to attenuated T cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response to Salmonella infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the frequency and nonspecific nature of the symptoms of <em>Salmonella</em> gastroenteritis, little is known about the rates of reinfection and correlates of immunity. The innate immune system, cell-mediated immunity, and humoral immunity all play important roles in limiting <em>Salmonella</em> infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Innate immune system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The innate immune system plays a critical role in the initial response to <em>Salmonella</em> infection. It may be the determining factor in whether the infection is subclinical or more aggressive. The importance of macrophages and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte response to <em>Salmonella</em> has been well described. Neutropenic mice have a high mortality in experimental <em>Salmonella</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], and depressed PMN function increases the incidence of <em>Salmonella</em> infection in humans. These conditions most commonly include sickle cell anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>], schistosomiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], and histoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In addition, Toll receptor agonists such as LPS, lipoprotein, and flagellin stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production, resulting in TNF-alpha and interleukin responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Activation of Toll-like receptor 5 and Ipaf by <em>Salmonella</em> flagellin has been a significant finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell-mediated immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in clearing infection and protecting against subsequent <em>Salmonella</em> infection. Clinical vigilance in the diagnosis and management of <em>Salmonella</em> infections should be increased in settings associated with cellular immunosuppression. As an example, infection is more severe and prolonged in patients with depressed cellular immunity due to glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>], and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In one study, nontyphoidal <em>Salmonella</em> (14 percent) were the second most frequent bacterial isolate after <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (29 percent) in a study of 249 bacteremias in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Nude mice and mice deficient in alpha-beta T cells are more susceptible to <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Murine models suggest that CD4+ T cells are more contributory than CD8+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Humoral immune responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The humoral response to <em>Salmonella</em> infection is complex and may be protective or maladaptive. Its importance in containing <em>Salmonella</em> infection is illustrated by the protective immunity induced in vaccination studies with <em>S. </em>Typhi. Mice deficient in B cells due to a targeted deletion of the Ig-mu gene show increased susceptibility to <em>Salmonella</em> infection and are unable to mount a significant convalescent immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. In addition, mucosal humoral immune responses may play a contributory role. Murine studies have shown that secretion of large amounts of a single monoclonal IgA directed against <em>S. </em>Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the intestinal lumen provides significant protection against systemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Furthermore, mucosal antibodies to nontyphoidal Salmonellae appear to inhibit the &quot;take&quot; of the oral live attenuated typhoid fever vaccine Ty21a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. </p><p>However, in a study that evaluated the effect of serum from HIV-infected patients on the killing of <em>S. </em>Typhimurium in vitro, a high serum concentration of antibodies against the LPS of non-typhoidal Salmonellae paradoxically prevented the destruction of <em>Salmonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The authors postulated that inhibitory antibodies in the serum of HIV-infected individuals could be responsible for this effect by blocking the action of bactericidal antibodies. These results suggest that the preferred vaccine target should be the bacterial outer-membrane proteins of non-typhoidal Salmonellae as opposed to LPS, since LPS could potentially elicit inhibitory rather than the desired bactericidal antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335526725\"><span class=\"h2\">Interaction with intestinal flora</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both pathogen transmission and pathogen clearance from the gut lumen can be mediated by the microbiota. In one study, mice with low complexity gut flora failed to clear <em>S. </em>Typhimurium from the gut lumen, and pathogen clearance was achieved by transferring a normal complex microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The normal microbiota were shown to be able to grow from a state of depletion and disturbed composition and gradually clear even very high pathogen loads from the gut lumen, a site inaccessible to most &quot;classical&quot; immune effector mechanisms. Thus, besides preventing pathogen transmission by an intact microbiota (also known as colonization resistance), the microbiota also facilitates pathogen clearance, a second, novel protective function. More recent work suggests this may be mediated by microbiota-enhanced antibacterial interferon-gamma responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>], which can be augmented by transfer of specific commensal communities. Increasingly, other specific mechanisms are being elucidated. For example, <em>Enterococcus faecium</em>'s secreted antigen A (SagA) is sufficient to protect <em>Caenorhabditis elegans </em>against&nbsp;<em>Salmonella</em>&nbsp;and other pathogens. SagA's peptidoglycan hydrolase activity generates muramyl-peptide fragments that enhance epithelial barrier integrity.</p><p>In a trial of the oral live-attenuated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=typhoid-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">typhoid vaccine</a> Ty21a, bacterial 16S rRNA pyrosequencing was employed to evaluate whether oral immunization resulted in alterations of the microbiota and whether a given microbiota composition is associated with defined <em>S. </em>Typhi-specific immunological responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. No discernible perturbations of the bacterial assemblage were found after vaccine administration. Among individuals able to mount a positive humoral response, no differences in microbial composition, diversity, or temporal stability were observed; however, individuals displaying broader (multiphasic) cell mediated immune responses harbored more diverse, complex communities. Further studies of the immune-modulatory properties of the human microbiota and the impact on disease transmission, pathogen clearance, and the response to vaccination is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352852941\"><span class=\"h2\">Persisters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some non-replicating <em>Salmonella</em> display a reversible, antibiotic-tolerant phenotype and can persist following antibiotic treatment and then revert to growth phase. This is of particular importance for <em>S. </em>Typhi, which has a chronic phase. Research on <em>Salmonella</em>&nbsp;growth and survival during antibiotic treatment has shown that antibiotic killing correlated with single-cell division rates, such that non-dividing&nbsp;<em>Salmonella</em>&nbsp;had the highest survival rates but were rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Most surviving bacteria were from the more common moderately growing, partially tolerant&nbsp;<em>Salmonella</em>. Using fluorescent single-cell analysis, other studies have shown that <em>Salmonella</em>&nbsp;persisters were part of a nonreplicating population that formed immediately after uptake by macrophages and were induced by vacuolar acidification and nutritional deprivation, similar to conditions that induce&nbsp;<em>Salmonella</em>&nbsp;virulence gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-salmonella-gastroenteritis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. After phagocytosis by na&iuml;ve macrophages, some&nbsp;persisters&nbsp;were subsequently able to resume intracellular growth, which could be a reservoir for relapsing infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
