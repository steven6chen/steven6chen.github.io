SS can involve lymph nodes and visceral organs in some patients.</p><p>SS may either be considered to have evolved from MF (ie, not initially meeting the criteria for SS) or may present <em>de novo </em>with full blown signs and symptoms of the condition. In either case, both MF and SS are defined histologically and staged by the same criteria. Since 2007, SS has been defined as T<sub>4</sub> (erythroderma) with B<sub>2</sub> (eg, absolute S&eacute;zary cell count of at least 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> blood involvement using the same TNMB classification syndrome as for MF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 \">table 1A</a>). In contrast to <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> MF, SS is usually much more symptomatic, has a lower potential for remission, and lower expected survival.</p><p>The treatment of SS will be discussed here. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of SS are presented separately, as is the diagnosis and treatment of MF.

T<sub>4</sub> erythrodermic skin disease characterizes those cases with erythema covering &ge;80 percent body surface area.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-advanced-stage-iib-to-iv-mycosis-fungoides\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of advanced stage (IIB to IV) mycosis fungoides&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the leukemic blood involvement in SS, systemic treatments are generally required. Systemic therapy can be given alone (ie, as monotherapy), with skin-directed therapy (SDT), or with other systemic therapies (combination therapy with or without SDT). There is a paucity of controlled clinical trial derived data to direct the selection of treatment modality in patients with SS. In general, the following principles apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments are primarily stage-based, but <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/tumor</span> burden and the &quot;tempo&quot; of disease activity can vary widely and should inform treatment choice. Measures of increased tumor burden include the degree of skin infiltration, the presence of skin tumors, the extent of lymphadenopathy, the burden of circulating tumor cells, and the rate of increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase and peripheral white blood cell count. As an example, immunomodulatory therapies are preferred for patients with newly diagnosed, slowly progressive disease. In contrast, chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapies may be preferred for more immediate disease control in patients with rapidly progressive disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical comorbidities and treatment-related issues (cost, accessibility) affect treatment choice given the chronicity and recurrent nature of SS. As an example, interferon therapy should be used with caution in patients with concomitant autoimmune conditions or in solid organ transplant patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Immune-enhancing/preserving</span> agents should be used prior to chemotherapy, if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response rates appear to be higher with combination approaches (eg, systemic agent[s] plus SDT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should monitor for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">colonization/skin</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/bacteremia</span> and other infections (fungal, viral) that can contribute to disease flare and will respond to antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with SS have severe pruritus; topical and systemic anti-pruritics are important adjuncts.</p><p/><p>Data regarding the efficacy of treatment come largely from retrospective case or cohort studies, or from open-label single arm clinical trials where patients with MF accounted for the majority population, but specific responses for patients with SS were not necessarily reported. Studies performed prior to 2007 varied widely in the definition of SS, particularly with regard to the peripheral blood malignant T cell burden. In addition, many older studies reported skin response, but lacked information about response in extra-cutaneous compartments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Retrospective single center studies that included patients with SS suggest that durable responses are rarely seen with systemic chemotherapy; other therapeutic options, including clinical trials, should be explored before instituting systemic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Very few prospective randomized controlled trials have been performed in patients with MF, and none has been performed in patients with advanced stage <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As such, it is difficult to accurately compare response, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates among treatments. </p><p>Consensus recommendations regarding the treatment of MF and SS have been proposed by the US Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), British Association of <span class=\"nowrap\">Dermatologists/United</span> Kingdom Cutaneous Lymphoma Group, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), Japanese Dermatologic Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(JDA)/Japanese</span> Skin Cancer Society(JSCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2,7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-11</a>]. Our approach is generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346421339\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9516622\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard initial therapy for patients with S&eacute;zary syndrome (SS), and experts differ in their preferred approach. As described above, the treatments are primarily stage-based, but a decision regarding the best therapy must also take into account symptoms, tumor burden, disease &quot;tempo&quot;, and comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9585954\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage IVA1 and IVA2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach for patients with stage IVA1 (B<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>0</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>) and stage IVA2 (B<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>) disease is similar and consists of systemic therapy with or without skin-directed therapy (SDT). When possible, immune preserving or immunostimulatory therapies are preferred as first line treatment. These are referred to as &quot;Group A&quot; therapies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90944 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>For most patients, we prefer extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) combined with biological response modifiers (BRMs; interferons, or retinoids) at the time of initial treatment. Adjuvant SDTs may also be added to enhance efficacy. ECP-based regimens are generally well tolerated and may be safely continued for years; however, ECP is only available at selected centers. Acceptable alternatives include single agent BRMs, oral low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vorinostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vorinostat</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romidepsin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romidepsin</a>). Methotrexate and HDAC inhibitors are more immunosuppressive than ECP, interferons, and retinoids, but less immunosuppressive than traditional single agent or combination chemotherapy. Single agent BRMs can be safely combined with SDTs in patients with SS for enhanced clinical efficacy; common combinations include phototherapy plus retinoids; phototherapy plus interferons; phototherapy plus low-dose methotrexate; phototherapy plus HDAC inhibitor; and radiation therapy plus interferons or retinoids. (See <a href=\"#H9585948\" class=\"local\">'Skin-directed therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>&quot;Group A&quot; systemic agents can also be combined together (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a> plus interferons, ECP plus bexarotene plus interferons, interferons plus an HDAC inhibitor, interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>). Leukapheresis is well tolerated and decreases circulating malignant cells, but the response may be short lived and has not been studied in a controlled fashion. Small studies also suggest that PUVA or total skin electron beam radiation therapy added to an existing systemic regimen may lead to not only improvement of skin disease but also reduction in circulating tumor burden in some SS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9585971\"><span class=\"h3\">Stage IVB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with stage IVB disease (SS with visceral involvement: T<sub>1-4</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>0</sub> to N<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>) are usually treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or single agent chemotherapy (&quot;Group B&quot; therapies). Immunostimulatory therapies (eg, ECP, interferon, retinoids) and SDTs may be used as adjuvant agents after completion of the chemotherapy regimen. Local radiation therapy may be used in conjunction with systemic therapy for local control of concomitant skin tumors or lymph node involvement.</p><p>For patients with solid organ IVB disease, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romidepsin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romidepsin</a> or systemic chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy may lead to more rapid responses, but there is no advantage to early aggressive combination therapy when compared with conservative sequential therapies in the management of advanced stage disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9585818\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial systemic therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26156957\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracorporeal photopheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is one of our preferred initial therapies for patients with stage IVA1 (T<sub>1-4</sub>, N<sub>0</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>) or stage IVA2 (T<sub>1-4</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>0</sub>) SS. ECP is a method of delivering PUVA <span class=\"nowrap\">(psoralen/8-methoxsalen</span> + ultraviolet A photochemotherapy) systemically to the peripheral blood compartment using an extracorporeal leukapheresis procedure. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SS. ECP is time consuming and only available at specialized centers, but is generally well tolerated and does not cause generalized immunosuppression. Single arm trials of ECP monotherapy where SS was reasonably defined and response was defined as &ge;50 percent skin improvement have demonstrated response rates of approximately 24 percent with median times to response of five to six months. Combining ECP with biological response modifiers (BRMs, interferons or retinoids) appears to result in quicker responses and greater response rates.</p><p>While the protocol and instrument used vary by center, ECP is generally administered as two consecutive daily treatments every two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The total time of treatment (collection, photoactivation, and reinfusion) is 1.5 to 4 hours. A trial of ECP should last at least six months. Treatment is continued until maximal response is achieved for at least three months, and is then gradually tapered to a maintenance regimen of one cycle (two consecutive treatments) once every 6 to 12 months with the assumption that the patient is significantly improved. If the patient is improved, but continues to manifest a significant disease burden, ECP should be continued, with consideration to the addition of interferon, a retinoid, or skin-directed therapy (SDT). </p><p>Adverse effects, which are infrequent, include mild hypotension during treatment, occasional fatigue, headache, transient increased itching and need for adequate venous access. Most permanent indwelling tunneled pheresis catheters (eg, Hickman catheters) should be avoided in heavily colonized patients with SS as they are at very high risk for line infections; peripheral IV access should be used if at all possible. ECP is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to psoralens. Very rarely, retinal toxicity has been reported likely due to abnormally elevated serum levels due to delayed metabolism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methoxsalen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methoxsalen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, from the small amount of heparin used during ECP, has also been rarely observed. Alternate anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> can be substituted in these cases. Should patients experience chills <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever following ECP, infection should be suspected. </p><p>ECP monotherapy can take several months to see clinical responses with a median time to response of five to six months; one group reported a mean time to response of nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Predictors of response to ECP monotherapy include erythrodermic skin disease (T<sub>4</sub>), total white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;20,000/microL,</span> S&eacute;zary count not more than 10 to 20 percent, &lt;2 years from original diagnosis, no bulky lymphadenopathy, no visceral disease, no prior chemotherapy, and higher peripheral blood NK cell and CD8+ T cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-19</a>]. </p><p>ECP can be combined with interferon (IFN) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic retinoids, and administered at lower doses than when administered as monotherapy (eg, IFN-&alpha; 3 to 5 million units subcutaneously three times weekly, interferon gamma 2 million units subcutaneously three times weekly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a> 150 to 300 mg per day). Such combination therapy can improve response rates. If additional SDTs are needed, topical corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-nitrogen-mustard-topical-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical nitrogen mustard</a>, phototherapy, or total skin electron beam therapy can be combined with ECP (as &quot;multimodality therapy&quot;). </p><p>Initial reports of ECP-based combination therapy as the initial treatment of SS have demonstrated tolerability, excellent response rates, and possibly improved survival compared with historical data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In one large single center retrospective study of 98 erythrodermic MF and SS patients treated with ECP-based combination therapy for at least three months over a 25-year period had an overall response rate of 75 percent (30 percent CR, 45 percent PR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another study, 12 patients with SS treated with topical steroids, PUVA, interferon-&alpha;, and ECP showed a response rate of 42 percent (4 of 12 partial response, 1 of 12 stable disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Support for their use comes from single arm prospective studies of patients with MF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; data regarding their efficacy in SS are limited, but initial studies suggest response rates of 25 to 30 percent.

There may be a lower rate of depression and autoimmune adverse events associated with IFN-&gamma;. </p><p>Triggering or unmasking of autoimmune phenomena (thyroiditis, psoriasis, vitiligo, colitis) may be observed.

For patients with SS, overall response (OR) should be based on a composite assessment of skin, blood, nodal, and visceral compartments.</p><p>In 2011, based on several consensus conferences from 2004-2008, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ISCL/EORTC/USCLC</span> published recommendations for clinical end points for <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total body skin scoring by modified skin weight assessment tool (mSWAT) is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83963 \">table 3</a>), keeping in mind that, by 2007 ISCL criteria, SS is defined as patches involving at least 80 percent body surface area (BSA) leading to a minimum score of 80.

In addition, a percentage of patients have disease that is refractory to initial or subsequent therapy. There is no standard treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory SS, and patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Outside of a clinical trial, relapsed disease may respond to repeated treatment with the same agents or may be treated with other skin-directed therapies (SDTs) or systemic therapies. In general, immune preserving therapies such as those described for initial systemic therapy are preferred prior to the use of traditional chemotherapy. Younger patients with high risk disease may be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"#H9585818\" class=\"local\">'Initial systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Single agent chemotherapy, also known as &quot;group B&quot; therapies, is typically reserved for patients with disease that is refractory to &quot;group A&quot; therapies (eg, extracorporeal photopheresis [ECP]; biologic response modifiers [BRMs]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90944 \">table 2</a>). Single agent chemotherapy may also be used as an alternative to other systemic therapies for the initial treatment of patients with stage IVA1 and IVA2 disease. However, most chemotherapy regimens tend to have short durability of response (approximately one year or less), and long term use is limited by toxicity. In contrast to management of refractory MF, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> is notable for its efficacy in refractory SS. Regimens may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other SDTs or systemic BRMs. Multiagent chemotherapy regimens are used less commonly due to short duration of response, but may be necessary for refractory disease or if quicker disease control is needed. As an example, multiagent chemotherapy would be preferred in a patient with erythroderma and concomitant large cell-transformed generalized tumors or transformed bulky nodal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346421456\"><span class=\"h2\">Single agent chemotherapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346421464\"><span class=\"h3\">Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegylated-liposomal-doxorubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</a> (20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> intravenously) has been used off-label for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma with overall response (OR) rates ranging from 40 to 90 percent.

As experience with this modality grows, it is an option increasingly offered to selected patients with high risk disease. A choice regarding the use of HCT must take into consideration the risk of treatment-related mortality and morbidity, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT is not recommended due to a uniformly high risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>].</p><p>Eligibility for allogeneic HCT varies across countries and institutions, and there are few strict rules about who is and who is not an appropriate candidate. Instead, clinical judgment should be used for the majority of patients as to whether the long- and short-term risks of transplant outweigh the benefits.

Older series are limited by changes in the definitions of SS and response criteria, while newer series are limited by the inclusion of small numbers of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span>.</p><p>The largest series was published by the European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group and included data on 60 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> who underwent myeloablative (27 percent) or reduced intensity (73 percent) conditioning followed by the administration of a graft from a sibling donor (75 percent) or matched unrelated donor (25 percent) transplant between 1997 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/88,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,93</a>]. Of the 60 patients, 24 were identified with SS (defined using pre-2007 criteria). Upon analysis of the entire <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> cohort, non-relapse mortality at one year was 20 percent. Non-relapse mortality was more common following myeloablative regimens and in patients with poor performance status prior to HCT. Relapse occurred in 26 of 60 patients (43 percent) at a median of 3.8 months after transplant. Of these, 17 underwent donor lymphocyte infusion, which resulted in a partial or complete response in 10 patients. Acute GVHD affected 40 percent of the entire <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> cohort by day 100; chronic GVHD affected 48 percent of the cohort at two years post-transplant. Of the 24 patients with SS, estimated survival rates at one and three years were 75 and 58 percent, respectively, with corresponding rates of progression-free survival of 42 and 38 percent, respectively.</p><p>The largest single center series was initially reported by MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2010 and updated in 2015 to include a total of 47 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">MF/SS</span> (at least 18 with SS) undergoing allogeneic HCT between 2001 and 2013 using a non-myeloablative regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-sezary-syndrome/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].

Estimated four-year overall and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 51 and 26 percent, respectively. Notably, patients with non-transformed SS had superior PFS compared with those with MF or transformed SS (PFS at four years 57 versus 10 percent).

SS is equivalent to T<sub>4</sub> plus B<sub>2</sub> disease. Patients with SS are considered to have stage IVA1, IVA2, or IVB disease, depending on the presence of nodal and visceral involvement.

Systemic therapy can be given alone (ie, as monotherapy), with skin-directed therapy (SDT), or with other systemic therapies (combination therapy with or without SDT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90944 \">table 2</a>). In general, immune-enhancing or preserving treatments are used prior to chemotherapy (see <a href=\"#H9516439\" class=\"local\">'Clinical approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with SS, we recommend the use of a systemic therapy with or without SDTs rather than SDTs alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Where available, we prefer the use of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) because it is not immunosuppressive and can be combined with other systemic therapies (eg, interferon, retinoid) and SDTs. A choice of combination therapy is generally guided by the side effect profile and patient comorbidities. SDTs are important adjunctive agents that can enhance clinical response when combined with systemic agents. (See <a href=\"#H9585954\" class=\"local\">'Stage IVA1 and IVA2'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26156957\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal photopheresis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with solid organ IVB disease, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romidepsin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romidepsin</a> or systemic chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Combination chemotherapy may lead to faster responses, but there is no advantage to early aggressive combination therapy when compared with conservative sequential therapies in the management of advanced stage disease. Local radiation therapy may be used in conjunction with some systemic therapies for local control of skin tumors. (See <a href=\"#H9585971\" class=\"local\">'Stage IVB'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsed disease may respond to repeated treatment with the same agents or may be treated with other skin-directed or systemic therapies, systemic therapies.
