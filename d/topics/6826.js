Although the etiology of back pain usually is benign, occasionally a significant congenital or acquired process is found. Of the latter, infectious, rheumatologic, and neoplastic processes are most likely to cause serious problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54179\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54179 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The evaluation of the child with back pain is reviewed here. The etiology of back pain in children and adolescents is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite presenting infrequently to the pediatric clinic, transient back pain is a relatively common occurrence in children, particularly after early adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. One large Scandinavian survey including more than 5000 children and young adults found that 7 percent of 12-year-olds had experienced at least one episode of low-back pain, the cumulative incidence increasing to 50 percent by age 18 years (girls) and 20 years (boys) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51206 \">figure 1</a>)[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence on any given day was noted to be approximately 1 percent for 12-year-olds and 5 percent for 15-year-olds, rising to 10 percent by the early 20s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54659\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54659 \">figure 2</a>). Most children with back pain have mild, nondisabling symptoms and do not seek medical care. Noted associations include female gender, increased time spent watching TV, negative scores on affect scales, and a family history of back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In the pediatric emergency department, back pain accounted for fewer than 0.4 percent of all visits in one inner-city series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Almost 90 percent of the children had symptoms for less than four weeks at the time of presentation. Approximately one-half of the episodes of back pain in all age groups were caused by musculoskeletal trauma, whereas the remainder were divided among infections (eg, urinary tract infection or viral illness; 9 percent), idiopathic pain (13 percent), sickle cell pain crisis (13 percent), and miscellaneous causes (6 percent). In the primary care setting, as well as in some specialty clinics, overloaded school backpacks are a potential cause of back pain in children, though prospective study has not invariably confirmed a correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Back pain that persists or worsens over the course of time deserves careful attention. In one series, 32 of 61 children presenting to an orthopedic clinic with back pain had serious underlying pathology, including nine with either infection or tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A lower incidence of serious underlying pathology was documented by a musculoskeletal referral group, who found no infection and four tumors (benign or malignant) in 265 children with back pain, although some children with these conditions might have been diagnosed by the primary care clinician and therefore not referred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. No data exist on the distribution of diagnoses in children with prolonged back pain seen by the primary care clinician. However, a survey of schoolchildren aged 11 to 14 years found that, among the 25 percent of children with back pain at initial evaluation, up to one-quarter also had pain at reevaluation one and four years later, suggesting that persistent pain is not only seen in the presence of severe organic pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Indeed, in this series, predictors of persistent pain were peer problems, short stature, and the presence of pain extending to areas outside the back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination are central to the evaluation of the child with back pain. The initial history should focus on ruling out symptoms that suggest the presence of a serious underlying condition, such as infection or malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77644 \">table 2</a>). Subsequently, the most important elements of the history are in the characterization of the presenting pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Red flags&quot; that should alert the clinician to possible serious underlying pathology include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young age (particularly under four years) &ndash; Benign musculoskeletal back pain is very uncommon in this group, increasing concern for malignancy or <span class=\"nowrap\">infectious/inflammatory</span> causes such as osteomyelitis or discitis.

Typically pain is described as improving after &ge;30 minutes with activity and a warm shower, although some patients worsen again in the evening.

By contrast, most back pain due to anatomic derangements is better in the morning and worsens with activity.

SLR is performed with the patient lying flat on his or her back with the uninvolved foot resting on the table and the knee bent at 45 degrees. The involved leg is raised straight up, while the ankle is kept at 90 degrees of flexion and the knee is fully extended. This test also may be performed with the patient seated; the seated position reduces strain on the hamstrings, which may give a false positive test when performed in the supine position.</p><p>A positive SLR test elicits pain radiating down the leg or into the buttock. This pain must be distinguished from discomfort from hamstring stretch. The pain usually is worsened by dorsiflexion at the ankle or pressure in the popliteal fossa, which stretches the tibial nerve. In adults, as a test for disc herniation, the SLR test has a sensitivity of approximately 0.8 (indicating relatively few false negative tests) and a specificity of approximately 0.4 (indicating many false positive tests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, a negative SLR test renders a herniated disc unlikely, although its presence is nonspecific. Specificity increases if elevation of the contralateral leg also elicits symptoms down the involved side (the crossed straight leg raising test) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In children, in whom the spectrum of disease is different, sensitivity and specificity of these tests have not been determined, but the SLR test remains a useful means to assess nerve root compression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory and radiologic evaluation of children and adolescents with back pain should be directed by the clinical findings.

The evaluation of an inflammatory condition (ie, one in which the pain is worse in the morning and improves with activity) usually includes a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP); however, patients with true spondylitis may have normal values on these assays. The evaluation of an infectious or malignant process (ie, one associated with fever and severe or constant pain) usually includes these tests as well as a blood culture and potentially labs suggestive of accelerated marrow turnover including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid.

HLA-B27 is relatively common (7 to 10 percent in the Caucasian population and exceeding 25 percent in some Native American and Scandinavian groups), whereas inflammatory spondylitis is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Therefore, the large majority of HLA-B27-positive children with back pain will have a non-HLA-B27-associated cause. Because spondylitis can occur in the absence of HLA-B27, testing generally does not affect posttest probability of disease sufficiently to be helpful in diagnosis. Other common rheumatologic assays, such as rheumatoid factor, ANA, and Lyme serology, are similarly not usually indicated in the evaluation of children with back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-child-with-back-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory and radiologic evaluation of children and adolescents with back pain should be directed by the clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77360 \">table 4</a>).

Plain radiographs of the spine should be obtained to exclude congenital or acquired bony pathology.
