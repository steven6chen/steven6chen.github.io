Many surgical diseases result in malnutrition, particularly those that are associated with a hypermetabolic state (eg, malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], gastrointestinal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and burns). Advanced age is also associated with malnutrition in hospitalized patients, many of whom require emergency operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although nutritional optimization prior to surgery is an option for a select group of patients, in most cases, this is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>An enteral route for nutrition is usually recommended if available because it stimulates the intestinal brush border, thereby preventing disuse atrophy and bacterial translocation. It also stimulates gallbladder emptying, thereby preventing bacterial stasis and cholecystitis. Enteral access is also less expensive and has fewer side effects and complications compared with central venous access, which is required for parenteral nutrition. Nevertheless, parenteral nutrition may be necessary for those patients with contraindications to enteral nutrition and for postoperative patients who are unable to meet their nutritional goals using the enteral route.</p><p>The indications and implementation of parenteral nutrition in postoperative patients are reviewed here. The consequences of malnutrition, nutritional assessment, indications for preoperative nutritional support, and implementation of enteral nutrition in surgical patients are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nutritional support in specific patient populations is also discussed in more detail in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nutritional-support-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nutritional support for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2806568197\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral nutrition provides support for patients in whom enteral feeding is insufficient in meeting nutritional goals or is contraindicated. In postoperative general surgery patients, enteral nutrition cannot be used due to the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal anastomotic failure may cause peritoneal soiling and peritonitis. Uncontrolled anastomotic leak leads to contamination of the peritoneal cavity and is a contraindication to enteral feeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal fistulas can arise for a variety of reasons (eg, anastomotic leak, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease). Enteral feeding may increase drainage through a fistula, which can delay fistula closure. Management of gastrointestinal fistula may include parenteral nutrition for those who become volume depleted, have electrolyte abnormalities, or become malnourished or lose weight in spite of appropriate medical therapy to control the fistula and enteral supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteric-fistulas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteric fistulas&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative mechanical bowel obstruction is associated with stasis of intestinal contents proximal to the obstruction, which results in bowel distension, nausea, vomiting, and pain. Postoperative ileus can similarly cause nausea, vomiting, and pain. During the interim period of conservative management of postoperative ileus or bowel obstruction, parenteral nutritional support may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of management of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is commonly observed after gastric and pancreatic surgery. In some cases, DGE precludes safe enteral nutrition in the early postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chyle leak is uncommon, but for patients who develop a chylous ascites or chylothorax and who do not respond to dietary modification, withholding an oral diet and parenteral nutrition may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chylous-bloody-and-pancreatic-ascites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chylous, bloody, and pancreatic ascites&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chylothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chylothorax&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplemental parenteral nutrition should also be considered in surgical patients whose nutritional needs are not being met using an enteral route, such as in those with inadequate absorptive capacity (short bowel syndrome), malabsorption (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, disuse atrophy, radiation enteritis), or in those with underlying conditions associated with chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility (eg, chronic pseudo-obstruction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeding tube complications can arise either early or late with feeding tube use (eg, gastrostomy, jejunostomy placement). When complications arise, enteral nutrition is often suspended to minimize further complications (eg, leaking into the abdomen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2846580356\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532537783\"><span class=\"h2\">Absolute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute contraindications to parenteral nutrition in the postoperative surgical patient include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ability to receive enteral feeding</strong> &ndash; Patients who can eat or receive enteral nutritional therapy should not receive parenteral nutrition. For patients who can eat but are unable to meet their nutritional goals by eating, enteral nutrition can usually be administered through a temporary feeding tube, which can be inserted and maintained with less risk of complications compared with central venous access, which is necessary to administer parenteral nutrition. Enteral formulas are also less expensive and do not require refrigeration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticipated duration of fasting is less than five days</strong> &ndash; During a period of fasting, glycogen serves as fuel for the body for 18 to 24 hours. Insulin secretion falls with fasting as well, which leads to muscle breakdown for fuel. Basal insulin secretion can be maintained with the administration of dextrose-containing fluid (eg, dextrose 5% or dextrose 10%) for approximately five days of fasting, thereby preventing muscle breakdown. After five days, this dextrose effect is lost, and nutritional support must be implemented to avoid muscle breakdown. Healthy patients generally tolerate fasting and may tolerate slightly longer periods of fasting (7 to 10 days) without a significant impact on their recovery. When the risks of parenteral nutrition administration and central venous access are weighed against this, it is difficult to justify parenteral nutrition administration prior to five days of fasting. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule, such as patients who were malnourished prior to surgery and those in whom prolonged bowel rest resulting from surgery is anticipated. (See <a href=\"#H3863139972\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Terminal illness</strong> &ndash; Although it is generally accepted that terminally ill patients should not be sustained artificially with parenteral nutrition, this has become highly controversial, particularly in the context of advances in palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, for postsurgical patients with recurrence of gynecologic malignancy, malignant bowel obstruction is common. In most cases, curative surgery is not an option, but symptoms can be palliated with gastrointestinal decompression. In the absence of parenteral nutritional support, survival beyond days to weeks is not to be expected. In a study of 55 patients with terminal intestinal obstruction due to ovarian cancer, parenteral nutrition was associated with a significantly longer median survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The median survival from time of diagnosis of intestinal obstruction for patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) was 72 days (range of 16 to 485 days) versus 41 days (range of 4 to 133 days) for those not receiving parenteral nutrition; however, the difference in survival was not significant when adjusted for chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced directive against artificial feeding</strong> &ndash; Parenteral nutrition is an artificial feeding modality that should not be used for patients who have declared their wishes against all forms of artificial feeding in an advanced directive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4179207230\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with appropriate nutritional indications for parenteral nutritional support may have a clinical course (eg, shock, sepsis) that mandates the delay of initiation or discontinuation of established parenteral nutritional support. Other complicating conditions (eg, volume overload, severe electrolyte disturbance) may make the TPN prescription difficult to formulate. The most important of these are discussed briefly below. When the complicating condition has been adequately controlled, parenteral nutrition can be resumed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shock</strong> &ndash; Administration of parenteral nutrition in the setting of hemodynamic instability or shock remains controversial. Parenteral nutrition can worsen the condition of a patient in shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In this setting, the calories provided by parenteral nutrition can be shunted into lactic acid production, increasing carbon dioxide production and contributing to other nonproductive physiologic processes. This may explain in part why permissive underfeeding has been associated with lower hospital mortality in critically ill patients. It remains unclear when parenteral nutrition can be safely instituted as shock resolves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Catheter-related infection</strong> &ndash; For patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">bacteremia/fungemia,</span> withholding nutritional support is necessary during the intervening &quot;line-free&quot; period needed to clear the infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Catheter management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acid-base disturbance</strong> &ndash; Acid-base disturbances are common in the postoperative patient, resulting from large-volume gastrointestinal fluid loss, bleeding, under-resuscitation, and resuscitation with certain intravenous fluids. These include lactic acidosis and contraction alkalosis. Caution is advised in administering parenteral nutrition prior to completion of resuscitation as parenteral nutrition can contribute to lactic acidosis in a stressed patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities#H79960784\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Acid-base imbalance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe electrolyte disturbance</strong> &ndash; In the setting of hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, aggressive electrolyte monitoring and correction is warranted to avoid complications. Caution is advised in prescribing parenteral nutrition electrolytes in cases of severe electrolyte disturbance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal dysfunction. For example, in cases of hyperkalemia associated with acute renal failure, the administration of potassium-containing parenteral nutrition can be dangerous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities#H3680371306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Etiologies of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Refeeding syndrome</strong> &ndash; In the setting of chronic malnutrition, the administration of parenteral nutrition can result in refeeding syndrome. With the institution of parenteral nutrition, brisk electrolyte uptake is often observed, resulting in hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia. To avoid complications of refeeding syndrome, electrolytes should be monitored several times daily for the first few days of parenteral nutrition administration. Electrolyte deficits should be aggressively corrected by intravenous replacement to prevent complications. Similarly, it may be appropriate to reduce the caloric content for the first few days of parenteral nutrition administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities#H2195489252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Refeeding syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volume overload</strong> &ndash; Parenteral nutrition is typically prepared in a predesignated volume of fluid required by the patient. However, the concentration of parenteral nutrition is limited by its components (eg, calcium, phosphorus), some of which will precipitate if over-concentrated. In patients with clinical features of volume overload (eg, respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary edema), the risk of further overload must be considered prior to administering parenteral nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H1475566922\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lack of central venous access</strong> &ndash; Since parenteral nutritional support requires central venous access for intravenous delivery, lack of access prevents administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3863139972\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H887604355\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing for initiation of parenteral nutrition in the postoperative period remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For most non-critically ill patients, the risk of postoperative parenteral nutrition usually outweighs the benefit during the first five days of fasting. For those with appropriate indications, the timing of initiation of parenteral nutrition is largely based on the patient's clinical condition and preoperative nutritional status. The timing of initiation in critically ill postoperative patients is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Initiation'</a>.)</p><p>For non-critically ill patients, recommendations are based on direct evidence from small randomized trials, observational studies, and indirect evidence from larger trials in critically ill patients, as discussed in the following paragraphs. For patients who do not suffer from chronic malnutrition, brief periods of fasting are tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients who were well nourished prior to surgery often tolerate a longer period of starvation (7 to 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Prolonged starvation (&gt;14 days) has been associated with higher complication rates compared with administration of parenteral nutrition. Thus, there is a general consensus: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The institution of parenteral nutrition should be delayed until at least five days after surgery in the absence of preoperative malnutrition. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After 14 days of postoperative starvation in healthy patients, parenteral nutrition should be initiated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with chronic malnutrition and anticipated prolonged bowel rest, it may be appropriate to institute parenteral nutrition earlier than five to seven days. In this subset of surgical patients, parenteral nutrition has been associated with lower complication rates when compared with fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p>In the absence of a severe stress response (eg, shock, systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS]), glycogen stores provide calories during the first 24 hours of fasting. Providing dextrose-containing intravenous fluids during the first five days of fasting stimulates basal insulin secretion and minimizes proteolysis during fasting. Approximately 400 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> are needed for a 70 kg patient. After five days of fasting, dextrose will not prevent muscle breakdown. </p><p>Early studies of intravenous nutritional therapies that were expected to improve outcomes in surgical patients were disappointing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/22,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25-27</a>]. Lactic acidosis was observed, and no mortality benefit was demonstrated, likely related to the stress response of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. When enteral feeding is not feasible, early initiation of parenteral nutrition has <strong>not</strong> been associated with benefit and may increase complications. </p><p>Guidelines published in 2016 by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) suggested that postoperative parenteral nutrition should be delayed five to seven days in patients who have undergone surgery, unless the patient is at high nutrition risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most studies addressing this question have been performed in critically ill patients. In particular, a large randomized trial supported later, rather than earlier, initiation of parenteral nutrition in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, in reviews of parenteral nutrition for critically ill patients without malnutrition, a short course of parenteral nutrition in the early postoperative period (&lt;5 days) compared with no nutrition failed to show an outcome difference and suggested increased morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review identified 27 trials evaluating nutritional support in patients undergoing elective general surgery procedures and found no significant differences in mortality or major complications for parenteral nutrition compared with standard care (usual oral diet plus intravenous dextrose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Major complications included pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis, catheter-related infection, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, liver failure, and anastomotic leak. There were also no differences for parenteral nutrition initiated preoperatively compared with postoperatively. For malnourished patients, parenteral nutrition (overall) was associated with a significant reduction in complications (relative risk 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.91) but no mortality differences. Among trials focused on the postoperative period, parenteral nutrition was instituted between 4 and 18 days postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/22,25,27,33-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,27,33-45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3734479355\"><span class=\"h2\">Cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of parenteral nutrition is typically dictated by the patient's ability to receive enteral nutrition. For some patients, it may be immediately obvious that prolonged parenteral nutritional support will be necessary or, rarely, permanent (eg, short gut syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>For patients in transition from parenteral to enteral therapy, the timing of discontinuation of parenteral therapy is variable. If a patient's <span class=\"nowrap\">oral/enteral</span> intake meets <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> daily fluid and caloric needs, parenteral therapy may be weaned over hours to prevent acute hypoglycemia. However, many recovering patients require a transition period, during which parenteral therapy is weaned down as <span class=\"nowrap\">oral/enteral</span> intake increases. In such cases, it is common to discontinue parenteral therapy when fluid goals are met and caloric goals exceed 60 percent of the patient's daily requirement. For patients with intestinal failure, bowel rehabilitation and protracted weaning may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H391326090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and adjustments'</a> and <a href=\"#H1430928176\" class=\"local\">'Transition to enteral and oral feeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1457994239\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of parenteral nutrition is to meet the nutritional requirements of the postoperative surgical patient. Underfeeding and overfeeding should both be avoided as each is associated with complications (eg, poor wound healing, infection, inability to wean from ventilator). </p><p>The caloric needs of the postoperative patient are largely dictated by the degree of surgical stress that is experienced. Major trauma or surgical intervention induces a metabolic response to injury and a catabolic state. Entry into a major body cavity (eg, cranium, chest, abdomen, joint, spine), long-bone fracture, and traumatic brain injury will result in a mild hypermetabolic response. In more severely stressed patients (eg, sepsis, pancreatitis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS], acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], large-volume transfusion, burns), the hypermetabolic response is more profound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H1331954772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Physiologic stress response to surgery'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Indirect calorimetry remains the most useful way to estimate the patient's caloric needs, but it is cumbersome and is not widely available. Although mathematical formulas have been proposed to estimate the nutritional requirements of the postoperative patient, there is no single universally accepted way to estimate the patient's requirements. In 2016, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) recommended the use of a simple weight-based (ideal body weight) estimate of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> when indirect calorimetry is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>For the average surgery patient without large wounds or other hypermetabolic states, 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> is a good starting point. For patients with hypermetabolic states (eg, sepsis, head injury) or large wounds, we increase the estimate to 30 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span>. Patients with large surface area burn wounds are the most highly stressed, hypermetabolic patients. An extensive, separate literature guides therapy for this patient population, whose needs exceed those of most other surgery patients. Nutritional requirements are reviewed separately for burn patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-demands-and-enteral-formulas-for-moderate-to-severe-burn-patients#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional demands and enteral formulas for moderate-to-severe burn patients&quot;, section on 'Calculating energy requirements'</a>.)</p><p>There is no universally accepted way to determine the difference between a mildly and more heavily stressed patient. Proxy markers of stress, including markers of a systemic inflammatory response (tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, leukocytosis, or leukopenia), are often used, together with clinical judgment.</p><p>The initial caloric estimate is a starting point for parenteral nutrition prescription. Adjustment to the daily calorie goal is based on many factors, including wound healing, weight gain, and ventilator weaning. Markers of nutrition (eg, albumin, C-reactive protein) are not reliable in postoperative patients, who have transitioned from the production of albumin to acute-phase reactant proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Similarly, 24-hour nitrogen balance depends on good renal function, which may be compromised in the postoperative patient. Typically, adequate wound healing and weight <span class=\"nowrap\">maintenance/gain</span> are evidence of nutritional adequacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412199668\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESCRIPTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1353691142\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial prescription of parenteral nutrition requires the following basic elements: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid volume &ndash; The initial volume of fluid should meet the anticipated fluid goals of the patient for 24 hours. For the average postoperative patient who is not expected to have significant ongoing fluid losses, 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day</span> is adequate. The exact minimum volume needed to prevent ingredient precipitation depends upon the content of the recipe. For the typical prescription in the average 70 kg adult, the minimum volume is typically approximately one liter. For patients in whom volume restriction is important, the minimum volume can be confirmed with the pharmacy. Similarly, for patients with high fluid losses (eg, enterocutaneous fistula, large open wound), a fluid prescription of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> is not unusual.

Typically, the fluid chosen to supplement parenteral nutrition is based on the bodily fluid that is lost. As an example, large-volume gastric fluid loss (eg, bowel obstruction) is high in chloride; as such, 0.9% saline may be chosen as a replacement fluid.

The average surgical patient requires 1.2 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of protein supplementation to sustain immune function, heal wounds, and maintain muscle mass. Each gram of protein contains 4 kcal of energy and is delivered in parenteral nutrition by incorporating an amino acid solution. Large wounds often require an additional 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of protein. However, the protein content may be limited by the patient's renal or hepatic function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipids &ndash; Typically, 10 to 20 percent of the daily caloric requirement is met with lipid emulsion. Each gram of lipid contains 9 kcal of energy. For patients receiving lipid-based medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> sedation, the lipid content contributed by the medication should be considered. In some institutions, lipids are administered as a separate infusion from the daily parenteral nutrition prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbohydrates &ndash; Carbohydrate content (in the form of dextrose) typically makes up 50 to 60 percent of the patient's daily calories.

Acetate is added to parenteral nutrition as a buffer and to achieve acid-base balance as an alternative to chloride in patients with hyperchloremia. Acetate is converted to bicarbonate, which is helpful for patients with ongoing bicarbonate loss. For patients without this issue, acetate content is minimized. As an example, a patient with a pancreatic fistula (rich in bicarbonate) would benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium acetate</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> to replete bicarbonate.

For patients with chronic kidney disease (eg, proteinuria), dietary protein restriction may slow the progression of their renal disease. Conversely, patients on peritoneal dialysis regularly lose protein from peritoneal fluid and may require aggressive supplementation. Consultation with a nephrologist is advised to determine protein restriction requirements for patient with significant renal dysfunction. The degree of restriction may be substantial (eg, 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> protein intake goal) and may need to be modified for a brief period of time to permit wound healing in the postoperative patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Insulin can be added to the parenteral nutrition once a stable recipe and a stable insulin regimen are established. Hyperglycemia is common in both hospital and ambulatory patients receiving parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1017122811\"><span class=\"h3\">High-volume fluid loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid shifts during and after major cavity surgery or large surface area debridement (eg, burn, small bowel obstruction, ascites production in liver failure, temporary maintenance of an open abdomen with a closed system suction dressing, enterocutaneous fistula) can be voluminous and difficult to predict. The volume of parenteral nutrition can be adjusted to accommodate large fluid losses. Typically, the starting parenteral nutrition volume is weight based (30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day)</span>. Additional fluid requirements are supplemented with intravenous fluids to meet the goal volume for 24 hours. The parenteral nutrition volume can also be adjusted, often in increments of 500 to 1000 mL on a daily basis, for convenience. Uncommonly, chronic daily fluid needs exceeding 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> can be met with the administration of supplemental intravenous fluids.

This consensus statement recommends underfeeding obese patients (ie, providing 65 to 70 percent of target energy requirements) based on caloric estimates obtained by indirect calorimetry. When indirect calorimetry is not available, weight-based caloric estimates and protein requirements can be calculated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> &ndash; 11 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> <strong>actual body weight</strong><span class=\"nowrap\">/day;</span> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of protein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI 40 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>&ndash; 11 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> <strong>actual body weight</strong><span class=\"nowrap\">/day;</span> 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of protein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BMI &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>&ndash; 22 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> <strong>ideal body weight</strong><span class=\"nowrap\">/day;</span> 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> protein</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H660584609\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypermetabolic states</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative patients with hypermetabolic states (eg, burns, traumatic head injury, polytrauma, sepsis) have nutritional requirements that far exceed the average postoperative goal of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span>. As an example, critically ill burn patients receiving parenteral nutrition may require as much as 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of carbohydrate alone, which can result in hyperglycemia. In some extreme cases, more-than-usual lipid content (eg, 30 percent lipid in burn patient) may be used. Similarly, burn patients require a minimum of 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of protein. It is important to recognize patients that fall into the extreme hypermetabolic state and to support them appropriately. For these patients, obtaining an accurate resting energy expenditure (eg, by metabolic cart) is essential in avoiding underfeeding and overfeeding. </p><p>Similarly, patients with traumatic brain injury require aggressive nutritional support. The Mifflin St. Jeor, Ireton-Jones, and Penn State equations are often used to estimate the caloric needs of traumatic brain injury patients, although the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure is indirect calorimetry. These patients also require higher protein content than the average postoperative patient (1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

When indirect calorimetry is not available to guide the estimate of a calorie goal, it is easy to underfeed or overfeed a patient.<strong> </strong>In the case of overfeeding, excess calorie administration results in hypercapnia, which contributes to persistent respiratory failure. For this reason, empiric adjustments are often made to the caloric goal when a patient's respiratory failure persists without explanation. Typically, the carbohydrate content is empirically decreased a small amount in hopes of observing improvement in respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H978572954\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing monitoring and adjustments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral nutrition can be prescribed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Most postoperative patients require laboratory monitoring in the perioperative period. Early in the course of parenteral nutritional support, it is common to check a daily chemistry panel. This is useful for identifying and adjusting electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring for refeeding syndrome, hyperglycemia, and hydration status. In the early postoperative period, it is common to add potassium, magnesium, and acetate until a stable recipe is achieved, as evidenced by normal blood chemistry.</p><p>As the fluid and electrolyte needs of the patient stabilize over days, parenteral nutrition recipes can be prescribed by the week. There is no standard time course for daily, weekly, and monthly ordering of parenteral nutrition as it typically requires individual customization. Early on, weekly assessments will include triglyceride levels and liver function studies to monitor further for complications such as steatohepatitis and hyperlipidemia. Chronic parenteral nutrition recipients may have their prescriptions extended beyond one week and may undergo less frequent laboratory monitoring. </p><p>Parenteral nutrition can also be administered in a cycled fashion. Typically, stable recipes can be converted from 24-hour infusions to 16- or 20-hour infusions, allowing the patient some time to be disconnected from the infusion. However, in some cases, ongoing fluid losses do not permit extended periods of time off of parenteral nutrition. </p><p>Lastly, for patients in the hospital, parenteral nutrition is often ordered on a daily basis, regardless of the chronicity of administration. Similarly, the preparation is compounded in a specialized pharmacy, which may be offsite. It is common to obtain parenteral nutrition from a private, outside pharmacy. In such cases, the deliveries are often batched on a daily basis for cost reasons. Parenteral nutrition has a short shelf life; on average, it should be administered within 30 hours at room temperature or nine days if refrigerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1430928176\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSITION TO ENTERAL AND ORAL FEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no generally accepted weaning method; weaning the volume or time spent on parenteral nutrition is decreased in a methodical fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

Typically, the patient should meet at least 80 percent of daily nutrition goals through enteral intake in order to maintain body weight and hydration. </p><p/><p>In some cases, enteroclysis can be used to help liberate the patient from parenteral nutrition. The principle behind this process is the collection and refeeding of enteral drainage from one part of the gastrointestinal track to another. As an example, a patient with both a high-output duodenal fistula and jejunal fistula can undergo collection of duodenal effluent, which can be fed into the jejunal fistula with a soft feeding tube. This process allows for physiologic enteral feeding, which is superior to parenteral nutrition. However, the technique is a challenging one for providers and patients alike. Despite this, some patients are successfully liberated from parenteral nutrition this way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>In some cases, patients who undergo parenteral therapy in hopes of allowing a fistula to close will fail to achieve fistula closure. As an example, a patient with an enterocutaneous fistula may have persistent drainage after months of enteral rest and parenteral nutrition. Such a patient may require further surgery to be liberated from parenteral nutrition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483431871\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of extensive bowel resection (eg, short gut syndrome) or fistulization, some patients may not be able to survive without parenteral nutrition due to intestinal dumping and malabsorption, which leads to dehydration, malnutrition, and a host of vitamin deficiencies. Many borderline patients require formal gut rehabilitation to be safely liberated from parenteral nutrition. Patients who lose &gt;75 percent of small bowel are expected to require dietary modification <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parenteral nutrition. In particular, ileal resections result in bile salt and B12 malabsorption, which will worsen steatorrhea and vitamin absorption. Similarly, loss of the colon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ileocecal valve may contribute to a patient's parenteral nutrition dependence.

Supplemental parenteral nutrition should also be considered in surgical patients whose nutritional needs are not being met using an enteral route. Patients with appropriate nutritional indications for parenteral nutritional support may have a clinical course that complicates initiation or mandates discontinuing established parenteral support (eg, shock, refeeding syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H2806568197\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2846580356\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal timing for initiation of parenteral nutrition in the postoperative period remains controversial.

Most surgical patients will tolerate a short period (five days) of supported fasting, during which intravenous fluids are often sufficient to prevent proteolysis. Patients who were well nourished prior to surgery often tolerate a longer period of starvation (7 to 14 days). Prolonged starvation (&gt;14 days) has been associated with higher complication rates compared with administration of parenteral nutrition. Thus, there is a general consensus that after 14 days, parenteral nutrition should be started. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For non-critically ill postoperative patients who are malnourished at the time of surgery and who are not expected to meet enteral nutrition goals within five days, we suggest early initiation of parenteral nutrition (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In this subset of surgical patients, parenteral nutrition has been associated with lower complication rates when compared with fasting.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenteral nutrition prescription is determined by estimating the caloric, protein, lipid, and fluid needs of the postoperative patient. For the average surgery patient, a good initial estimate of required calories is 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span>. A large number of calories are needed for those with large wounds or other hypermetabolic states. Initial protein, lipid, and carbohydrate needs are reviewed above. Adjustments are made to customize the formula to account for coexisting conditions and ongoing nutritional and fluid and electrolyte needs. (See <a href=\"#H1353691142\" class=\"local\">'Initial prescription'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3156007042\" class=\"local\">'Prescription adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition from parenteral to enteral nutrition is commonly achieved when the patient recovers from surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications of surgery. Some patients require prolonged parenteral nutrition support and bowel rehabilitation. Rarely, chronic parenteral nutrition is necessary for those with intestinal failure. (See <a href=\"#H3734479355\" class=\"local\">'Cessation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1430928176\" class=\"local\">'Transition to enteral and oral feeding'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mogensen KM, Robinson MK, Casey JD, et al.
