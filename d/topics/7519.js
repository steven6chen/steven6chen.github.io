A retrospective review of more than 300,000 patients in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) from 1992 to 1997 demonstrated that dialysis patients had an age-adjusted incidence ratio for fungal infections of 9.8 compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The vast majority of these fungal infections were due to <em>Candida</em> species (79 percent).</p><p>The majority of fungal infections in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are related to the technique of peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis resulting from fungi carries a higher morbidity and mortality than bacterial infections. Reported complications include sclerosing peritonitis, adhesions with resulting bowel obstructions or stricture, invasion of the bowel wall, and abscess formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Extraperitoneal spread of infection is unusual, and mortality is usually related to underlying conditions.</p><p>An overview of fungal peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous peritoneal dialysis is presented in this topic review. A general overview of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-therapy-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and therapy of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections of the peritoneal space are the main complication of peritoneal dialysis; they are usually caused by staphylococcal species. By comparison, fungi are responsible for 2 to 13 percent of such cases. Most fungal peritoneal dialysis-associated infections are due to <em>Candida</em> species, especially <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>C. parapsilosis</em>. Assorted molds and yeasts, such as species of <em>Aspergillus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], <em>Fusarium</em>, <em>Rhodotorula</em>, <em>Mucorales</em>, and dematiaceous molds, are occasionally observed. Fungi, when found with bacteria as part of a polymicrobial peritonitis, are a predictor of a poor response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reasons for contamination of peritoneal fluid with fungi are breaks in sterile technique when connecting peritoneal catheters to bags of dialysate, infections at the cutaneous site of catheter entry, intestinal perforation, peritoneovaginal fistulae, and transmigration of fungi across the bowel wall into the peritoneum.</p><p>The presence of certain additional factors in peritoneal dialysis patients increases the risk for fungal peritonitis. Almost all published series have found an association with both recent antibacterial use and episodes of bacterial peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-11</a>]. When these series are combined, 65 percent of patients had been exposed to antibiotics within 30 days of the onset of fungal peritonitis, and 48 percent had experienced an episode of bacterial peritonitis within the same time frame.</p><p>It is difficult to determine whether antibiotic exposure and peritoneal inflammation actually predispose to fungal infections or whether these factors merely identify a high-risk group of patients prone to peritonitis because of poor technique. Recent exposure to antibiotics may predispose to fungal peritonitis by shifting the balance of the patients' endogenous skin and bowel flora towards yeast species, thereby increasing the chances of contamination during catheter manipulation.</p><p>Other risk factors include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of emergency peritoneal dialysis &ndash; A trend towards infection with fungal organisms has been observed in association with acute or emergent peritoneal dialysis performed in the hospital; this may be due to the severity of illness of these patients, concurrent treatment with antibacterial agents, or the administration of dialysis by personnel unfamiliar with the techniques associated with peritoneal dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection &ndash; Patients with HIV infection who receive chronic peritoneal dialysis have a higher frequency of peritonitis with yeasts when compared with other chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human immunodeficiency virus and dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extraperitoneal fungal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental exposures &ndash; There are reports of outbreaks of <em>Candida </em>peritonitis associated with contamination of water baths used to warm dialysate solutions and even environmental contact with pigeon guano [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, contact with soil during gardening or recreation may lead to peritonitis with certain molds.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms and signs of fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients are the same as those for bacterial peritonitis. The most consistent findings are a cloudy dialysate and abdominal pain, which occur in approximately 90 and 75 percent of patients, respectively. Abdominal pain that is usually diffuse may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The symptoms may also be subtle, consisting of only mild abdominal pain and low-grade fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients have an elevated temperature; examination of the abdomen typically displays signs of peritonitis, including diffuse tenderness with guarding, rebound tenderness, abdominal distention, and decreased bowel sounds. Poor return of the dialysate during episodes of fungal peritonitis occurs more frequently with infections by molds, which can potentially block catheter ports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When examining the dialysate fluid for fungal infection, attention should be paid to the duration of the dwell and whether or not peritoneal lavage was performed prior to sample collection; these factors can influence cell counts and culture. As for all peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, the criterion for infection is a cell count &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> with &gt;50 percent polymorphonuclear cells. However, among patients with fungal peritonitis, the peritoneal white blood count is almost always &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> with a polymorphonuclear cell predominance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal fluid analysis'</a>.)</p><p>Although local eosinophilia is a frequent transient finding during the first few weeks after initiating peritoneal dialysis, peritoneal eosinophilia has also been described with certain mold infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The finding of eosinophils in the peritoneal fluid of a patient on chronic peritoneal dialysis with suspected infection should raise the consideration of fungi as etiologic agents.</p><p>Gram stain of the peritoneal fluid may reveal yeasts consistent with <em>Candida</em>. However, other stains, such as calcofluor white, are more sensitive for other fungi.</p><p>The diagnosis of fungal peritonitis is made by culturing the dialysate fluid. It is recommended that at least 10 mL of peritoneal fluid be sent for fungal culture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis#H2974930306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>). Although <em>Candida</em> species usually grow quickly in culture, other fungi may require weeks to emerge. The diagnosis therefore requires a high level of suspicion, with some cases presenting as culture-negative peritonitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general goals of treatment should be twofold: The infection should be eradicated, and the peritoneum should be preserved for future use in peritoneal dialysis. Upon diagnosis of fungal peritonitis, the peritoneum should therefore be lavaged until the returning fluid is clear; this helps prevent adhesions and lowers the fungal burden. Prompt initiation of antifungal therapy is indicated if a calcofluor white or Gram stain reveals yeast or hyphae. Subsequent therapy is based upon culture results, susceptibility of the organism, and patient response.</p><p>As stated in multiple guidelines, it is recommended that the catheter be removed immediately after fungi are identified by microscopy or culture and that the patient should be placed on hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for treatment of candidiasis, as well as other IDSA guidelines, can be accessed through the IDSA website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There appears to be a very small subset of patients with yeast peritonitis occurring within two weeks of initiation of peritoneal dialysis for acute renal failure (ARF) in whom antifungal therapy alone may result in cure. If an infection with a mold arises in this same group of patients, however, catheter removal is almost always required to achieve a cure.</p><p>Instillation of amphotericin B into the peritoneal cavity has occasionally been used as the sole or adjunctive therapy. However, this regimen is also discouraged because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not consistently successful in curing infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is a frequent cause of abdominal pain upon instillation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can contribute to adhesion formation with subsequent loss of the peritoneum as a dialyzing membrane</p><p/><p>Decisions regarding the type of antifungal chemotherapy should be based upon the patient's clinical state and on the particular fungus-causing infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We propose the following strategy for fungal peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis. If the dialysate is grossly turbid, peritoneal lavage should be continued until the returning fluid is clear. Systemic antifungals should be given, and the catheter should be removed as soon as possible. Prompt initiation of antifungal therapy is indicated if a calcofluor white or Gram stain reveals yeast or hyphae.</p><p>The choice of antifungal agent varies based upon the specific infecting organism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For empiric coverage of fungal peritonitis when there is no suggestion of the identity of the fungus from inspection of the fluid and until cultures return, we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2814742313\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Steve J Schwab, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Abbott KC, Hypolite I, Tveit DJ, et al.
