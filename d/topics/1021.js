Previously, antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended for many GI procedures in patients with high-risk cardiac conditions to protect against infective endocarditis. However, practices have substantially changed, in part due to the low incidence of infective endocarditis following GI procedures and the lack of randomized trials supporting the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics can be associated with the development of resistant organisms, <em>Clostridium difficile </em>colitis, unnecessary expense, and drug toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology#H402660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic use'</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to GI procedures will be reviewed here. General issues related to prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.asge.org/assets/0/71542/71544/5f63a8cf-9594-4e73-b206-7d48f5926dda.pdf&amp;token=EfBXVX46uGc+giqntnBvrQ67ph6U1z/p37kNs+nMkykFbU23W8HPkEFOPI7ofTsjHLwolvZN4ZT4Bzvd2L2LHU8cbfEO4m4wFPZteOkLSBw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2545\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy</a> updated its guideline on antibiotic prophylaxis for GI procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Guidelines were also published by the <a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/116/15/1736.long&amp;token=VpCvuzG0EeDGAUhaVhjA1DnyTuTJV/sayGWg6uVaB8nEGakc0bMQZ5xHBh8UuxgyIXCYIOQTOCbvv/U3D73f2w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2545\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Heart Association</a> in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and by the British Society of Gastroenterology in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The discussion that follows is generally consistent with all three guidelines. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections following endoscopic procedures are rare and are presumably the result of bacteremia induced during the procedure or, in the case of procedures such as pancreatic cyst aspiration, the result of inoculation with bacteria during the procedure.</p><p>Bacteremia results from translocation of endogenous bacteria into the blood stream via mucosal trauma, whereas inoculation of sterile tissues or spaces (eg, cysts) occurs from direct contact with a contaminated endoscope or endoscopic accessory. Contrast injection may also result in bacteria being introduced into a previously sterile space (eg, the biliary tree during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography).</p><p>The concern with regard to bacteremia is that the bacteria may colonize a remote site, such as a diseased heart valve or a prosthetic joint, resulting in infection. However, it is likely that this is <strong>not</strong> a significant problem with regard to gastrointestinal (GI) procedures.</p><p>As an example, there is only a weak association of GI procedures with infective endocarditis, and data are lacking to support a causal link [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A 2015 literature review by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy found only 25 cases of infective endocarditis following endoscopic procedures, which included esophageal dilation, sclerotherapy, gastroscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis has not been shown to prevent endocarditis following GI procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RATES OF BACTEREMIA AND INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rates of bacteremia following gastrointestinal (GI) procedures are generally lower than those seen following routine daily activities such as eating and defecating, and rarely result in clinically evident infection. Furthermore, bacteremia due to organisms capable of causing endocarditis occurs in less than 5 to 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient bacteremia is commonly seen following routine daily activities, with rates as high as 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Factors that may increase the risk include multiple passes of the dilator and dilation of malignant strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic sclerotherapy of varices</strong> &ndash; The mean reported rate of bacteremia is 15 percent (range 0 to 52 percent) with sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Endoscopic variceal ligation is not considered high risk for bacteremia (risk estimated at 9 percent [range 1 to 25 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</strong> &ndash; The risk of bacteremia with ERCP depends upon whether the bile duct is obstructed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In one review, the rate was 6 percent in the absence of obstruction and 18 percent in the presence of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidence of post-ERCP cholangitis is also increased in patients with obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) septic complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other procedures are considered high risk for infection unrelated to bacteremia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)</strong> &ndash; The reported rate of bacteremia associated with EUS-FNA ranges from 4 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], making it a low-risk procedure with regard to bacteremia. However, the overall infection risk is probably higher. The risk of infection depends on the type of lesion being sampled. Limited data suggest that solid lesions are at low risk for infection (0.01 to 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The risk of infection following EUS-FNA of cystic lesions is less clear, with reported rates ranging from less than 1 percent to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. Patients undergoing EUS-FNA of mediastinal cysts may be at higher risk for infection, with several case reports and case series reporting infection following EUS-FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], some occurring despite the use of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the risk of infection in patients undergoing EUS-FNA of cystic lesions is unclear. In a study in which 90 percent of 603 patients undergoing EUS-FNA of pancreatic cysts received antibiotic prophylaxis, only one patient became infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, a retrospective study that compared 178 patients who underwent EUS-FNA of pancreatic cysts without antibiotic prophylaxis with 88 patients who did receive antibiotic prophylaxis found that the rate of infection was very low, regardless of whether antibiotics were given (one transient fever in the group that did not receive antibiotics, one cyst infection in the group that received antibiotics, and one case of <em>C. difficile</em> in the group that received antibiotics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or jejunostomy (PEJ) tube placement</strong> &ndash; In a Cochrane analysis of 12 randomized trials of 1271 patients undergoing PEG tube placement, patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis had a significant reduction in peristomal infections compared with those who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics (pooled odds ratio 0.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

This includes patients undergoing endoscopic biopsies or polypectomy. The mean reported rates of bacteremia have been estimated to be 4 percent for both gastroscopy without biopsy and colonoscopy, and 0 to 1 percent for flexible sigmoidoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Gastrointestinal (GI) procedures are low risk for bacterial endocarditis and therefore antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis is not recommended, even in patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions (such as prosthetic valves or prior endocarditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in other settings, such as prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and jejunostomy (PEJ) tube placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77909136\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific procedures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77909142\"><span class=\"h3\">Routine upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and flexible sigmoidoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for routine endoscopic procedures associated with a low risk of bacteremia. This includes patients undergoing endoscopic biopsies or polypectomy. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for most patients undergoing high-risk procedures performed during routine endoscopy (eg, esophageal stricture dilation). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Low-risk procedures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'High-risk procedures'</a> above.)</p><p>However, antibiotic prophylaxis is suggested for patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> advanced hematologic malignancies, or cirrhosis with ascites undergoing procedures such as esophageal dilation or endoscopic sclerotherapy, though data to support this recommendation are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H77906775\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised states'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cirrhosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77909163\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are required for patients with cholangitis as part of their routine care, so additional prophylactic antibiotics are not needed. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for patients with biliary obstruction that is unlikely to be drained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-17</a>]. In one trial, the two factors associated with infection following ERCP were incomplete biliary drainage (odds ratio [OR] 5.0) and failure to give antibiotic prophylaxis (OR 6.7). Conditions that make successful drainage less likely include malignant hilar obstruction and primary sclerosing cholangitis. If drainage is not successful, antibiotics should be continued for three to five days following the procedure. We also suggest giving antibiotic prophylaxis to patients at high risk for infection (eg, those with severe neutropenia, advanced hematologic malignancy, or cirrhosis with ascites). (See <a href=\"#H77906775\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised states'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cirrhosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required in the absence of cholangitis, if biliary drainage is likely to be successful, and for patients undergoing ERCP for reasons other than biliary obstruction. </p><p>Finally, patients with inadequate endoscopic biliary drainage following ERCP should receive antibiotics due to the high risk of post-ERCP cholangitis in this setting. Once drainage has been established, antibiotics can be discontinued if there is no evidence of cholangitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-ercp-septic-complications#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) septic complications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for cholangitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77909244\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for most patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of solid lesions. However, it is suggested for patients with severe neutropenia, advanced hematologic malignancies, or cirrhosis with ascites. (See <a href=\"#H77906775\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised states'</a> below.)</p><p>The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) suggests antibiotic prophylaxis for EUS-FNA of cystic lesions, including pancreatic cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, with the exception of EUS-FNA of mediastinal cysts and EUS-FNA in patients at increased risk of infection, we do not agree with this recommendation. We support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with mediastinal cysts because these cysts seem to have a higher risk of infection, even when prophylactic antibiotics are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On the other hand, we believe there are insufficient data to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics for EUS-FNA of other cystic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/9,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,18</a>]. However, since the data regarding the potential benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics prior to EUS-FNA of pancreatic cysts are inconclusive, giving prophylactic antibiotics in this subset of patients is a reasonable alternative (especially if the cyst is not fully aspirated). </p><p>In addition, we give prophylactic antibiotics to all patients undergoing interventional EUS procedures, such as drainage of walled-off pancreatic necrosis, biliary drainage, and fine-needle injection of <span class=\"nowrap\">cysts/tumors</span>. The antibiotic is given before the procedure and typically continued for three to five days after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77909340\"><span class=\"h3\">Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or jejunostomy placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for all patients prior to placement of a PEG tube since meta-analyses of randomized trials have demonstrated that they substantially reduce the risk of peristomal wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. Antibiotics are also recommended prior to PEJ tube placement. </p><p>While prophylactic antibiotics are typically given intravenously (IV), a study from Sweden found that a single 20 mL dose of an oral solution of sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> (160 mg) deposited in the PEG catheter immediately after insertion was as effective as a single dose of antibiotic IV before the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The emergence of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(MRSA) as a major pathogen causing PEG-site infections in some centers has raised concerns about the effectiveness of prophylaxis with cephalosporins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. We agree with the ASGE guideline recommendation for preprocedural screening for MRSA in areas where MRSA is endemic and attempting decontamination before placing the feeding tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients with high-risk cardiac lesions who have active GI infections that are likely to be associated with enterococci (eg, cholangitis) should receive antibiotics active against enterococci.

They do not consider any GI procedure high risk for bacteremia with microorganisms that can cause endocarditis, and therefore do not recommend the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis, even in patients with high-risk valvular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, they do note that it is reasonable to administer antibiotic therapy in high-risk patients with established GI tract infections, and the ASGE guidelines recommend that patients with high-risk cardiac lesions receive antibiotics that are active against enterococci if they have infections likely to be associated with enterococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A potential source of confusion and concern for some patients with cardiac lesions is that they may have been told in the past that they must have antibiotic prophylaxis for all procedures. We recommend that patients be reassured that the recommendations to not give antibiotic prophylaxis come from several professional societies, including the ASGE and the AHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77906775\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunocompromised states</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients who are severely neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> or who have advanced hematologic malignancies has not been well studied.

We agree with the recommendation of the ASGE that antibiotic prophylaxis be given to patients with severe neutropenia or advanced hematologic malignancies who are undergoing procedures associated with a high risk of bacteremia.

One study of 244 positive ascitic fluid cultures found that prior GI endoscopy was associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis on univariate but not multivariate analysis. Because patients may be at risk for bacterial translocation during endoscopic procedures, we suggest antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are undergoing procedures that are high risk for bacteremia, particularly if the patient is unlikely to tolerate an infection (eg, patients with decompensated cirrhosis).

However, the AHA (but not the ASGE) recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures within the first six months of graft placement to permit time for endothelialization of the graft. The ASGE does not recommend prophylaxis, citing evidence that no infection of a graft has been associated with endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When possible, we suggest that elective procedures be performed before a synthetic graft is placed or delayed for six months following graft placement. If a procedure is necessary within six months of graft placement, we generally will give antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk procedures.</p><p>If the decision is made to give prophylactic antibiotics, the regimens recommended for patients who are immunocompromised are appropriate choices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54121 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Prosthetic joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for patients with prosthetic joints because data supporting a benefit are limited. However, a case-control study suggested upper endoscopy may increase the risk of infection in patients undergoing upper endoscopy within two years of a joint replacement (adjusted odds ratio 4, 95% CI 1.5-10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Currently, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended by the ASGE or the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. In addition, it is no longer recommended in <a href=\"http://www.aaos.org/about/papers/advis.asp&amp;token=rRsi2oZ9Wl9L7jZu7OjAg8JcDIx8ymzC84aJJlZt+E8Ukhvy1zDv+z/XOm+3I4y6ON1YZWOcWtLeuOthPg6xsA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2545\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a> from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Our approach to a patient whose surgeon has recommended antibiotics is to discuss the issue with the patient. If the patient still wishes to receive antibiotics after the discussion, we will provide antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This recommendation may change if more data become available suggesting an increased risk of infection following prosthetic joint placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether to give antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis is unclear. There have been several case reports of peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis following colonoscopy, particularly after polypectomy (presumably because of bacterial translocation into the peritoneal cavity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], but there are no definitive data to guide decisions. A working group recommended that the abdomen be emptied of fluid prior to any procedure involving the abdomen or pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Our practice is to not give antibiotic prophylaxis, but in patients undergoing colonoscopy, we recommend performing the procedure with the peritoneum empty. By contrast, the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) recommends antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing colonoscopy with polypectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotic-prophylaxis-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and the ASGE recommends prophylaxis for all patients undergoing lower GI endoscopy.

We believe there are insufficient data to support their use in this setting. However, since the data regarding the potential benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics in such patients are inconclusive, giving prophylactic antibiotics is a reasonable alternative (especially if the cyst is not fully aspirated) and is consistent with the 2015 American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines.
