However, aortic valve surgery entails substantial risks for some patients with severe comorbidities, and for some considered at &quot;extreme&quot; risk, surgery is not appropriate. In others, technical limitations (eg, porcelain aorta) may mean that surgery is not feasible. </p><p>Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy (also known as balloon aortic valvuloplasty) was developed as a less invasive means to treat severe AS but has limited utility and substantial risks. Subsequently developed, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative method for treating severe AS in selected patients with unacceptably high estimated surgical risks. A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended in approaching patients with symptomatic AS and choosing between surgical AVR, TAVI, and medical therapy, with possible use of percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p>This topic will review percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy in adults. Indications for AVR, considerations for surgical AVR and TAVI, estimating the risk of aortic valve surgery, and medical therapy of symptomatic AS are discussed separately.

The aim is to relieve the stenosis by fracturing calcific deposits within the valve leaflets. Stretching of the annulus and separation of the calcified commissures may also contribute to valve opening, though the effects of valvotomy have not been fully elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114805108\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES AND LIMITATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of important limitations to the use of balloon aortic valvotomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite a moderate reduction in the transvalvular pressure gradient, which is often accompanied by an improvement in symptoms, the post-procedure valve area rarely exceeds 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, leaving the patient with persistent severe aortic stenosis (AS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious complications (stroke, acute aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, major access-related complications) have been reported in 10 to 20 percent or more of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A United States inpatient database study of 2127 percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomies performed in patients over 60 years of age between 1998 and 2010 reported a complication rate of 28.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The most common complications were respiratory (7.7 percent), cardiac (7.3 percent), and vascular (6.8 percent). The overall complication rate did not change significantly during the study period, though the rate of vascular injury fell from 6 percent in 1998 to 2.9 percent in 2010. Predictors of complications included increasing comorbidities, female sex, and unstable patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In-hospital mortality rates were about 10 to 20 percent in early as well as later series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. The United States inpatient database study found that hospital mortality for balloon aortic valvotomy decreased from 11.5 percent in 1998 to 1999 to 8.8 percent in 2009 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Predictors of in-hospital mortality included the presence of greater comorbidities, an unstable patient, any complication, and weekend admission. Higher operator volume was associated with substantially lower mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restenosis and clinical deterioration occur in most cases within 6 to 12 months, and the long-term outcome resembles the natural history of untreated AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Repeat balloon aortic valvotomy can be performed, but most such attempts fail within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Outcomes in children and young adults with AS without significant valve calcification are discussed separately. In summary, balloon aortic valvotomy is an effective therapy in selected children and young adults with AS (largely due to bicuspid aortic valve) without aortic valve calcification although a significant number of patients require reintervention during long-term follow-up.

For patients being considered for high-risk surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement and possible balloon aortic valvotomy, a multidisciplinary heart valve team (including cardiologist, cardiovascular surgeon, and interventionalist) should collaborate to optimize care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Operative risk assessment should include consideration of estimated operative mortality, frailty, major organ system compromise, and comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95631 \">table 2</a>).
