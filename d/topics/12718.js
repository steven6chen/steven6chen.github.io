These consist of four isoprenoid units joined in a head to tail fashion. There are two main forms of vitamin A: provitamin A carotenoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> and others), and preformed vitamin A.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provitamin A carotenoids are found in plants. There are many forms of provitamin A, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a> is only one that is metabolized by mammals into <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preformed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl esters) is the most active form of vitamin A; it is mostly found in animal sources of food and is also the form supplied by most supplements. Some supplements provide a combination of provitamin A (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>) and preformed vitamin A. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common food sources of preformed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> (retinols) are liver, kidney, egg yolk, and butter. Provitamin A (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>) is mostly found in green leafy vegetables, sweet potatos, and carrots. Because vitamin A from animal sources or supplements is preformed, it is more likely to cause toxicity than the provitamin A from plant sources. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Excess'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial steps in metabolism depend on the type of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> ingested. The metabolism of provitamin A (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>) into active vitamin A is a highly regulated step, so excessive intake of vitamin A from plant sources is very unlikely to cause toxicity. By contrast, absorption and storage of preformed vitamin A (eg, in animal liver or dietary supplements) is efficient, and toxicity can occur if excessive quantities are ingested. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Excess'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provitamin A (mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>, from plant sources), must be cleaved to retinal before absorption. This step is subject to feedback regulation, which depends on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preformed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl esters, from supplements or animal sources) is hydrolyzed into retinol in the lumen of the small intestine. A number of retinyl ester hydrolases are involved in this process at the level of the mucosal brush-border [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It also appears that pancreatic enzymes have a role in retinoid assimilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Bile salts form micelles which allow water solubilization of the products of lipolysis and absorption through the intestinal mucosa. These steps are highly efficient and not subject to feedback regulation.</p><p/><p>Within the small intestine, retinols are re-esterified into retinyl-esters, incorporated into chylomicrons, and excreted into lymphatics and plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the blood, chylomicrons are then broken down into multiple remnants including apolipoproteins B and E, which contain retinol esters.</p><p>The apolipoproteins are then taken up by the liver via a receptor-mediated endocytosis on the surface of the hepatocytes, and the retinol esters are released [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These are further metabolized to eventually combine with Retinol Binding Proteins (RBP) before storage in vitamin A-containing lipid globules within the hepatic stellate cells (formerly known as Ito cells).</p><p>About 50 to 85 percent of the total body retinol is stored in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is also found in many other tissues in much smaller concentrations. In order for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> to reach its target organs, it binds to RBP molecules for release into plasma as a retinol-RBP complex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin A</a> has a number of biologic actions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the eye, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> has two major roles: prevention of xerophthalmia (abnormalities in corneal and conjunctival development) and phototransduction.</p><p>Two types of retinal photoreceptor cells are involved in the visual process. The cone cells are responsible for the absorption of light and color vision in bright light. The rod cells detect motion and are responsible for night-vision. In the rod cells of the retina, all-trans-retinol is converted to 11-cis-retinol, which then combines with a membrane-bound protein called opsin to yield rhodopsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A similar type of reaction occurs in the cone cells of the retina to produce iodopsin. The visual pigments absorb light at different wavelengths depending upon the type of cone cells. As an example, the red-sensitive cone cells absorb any light stimulus in the wavelength of the color red. This leads to the absorption of the three basic colors, red, green, and blue. The light-activated transformation of these complexes leads to a cascade of hyperpolarization of rod cell membrane, therefore enabling the transmission of light stimuli to the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular differentiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other than its importance in vision, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> is crucial to cellular differentiation and integrity in the eye. All the cells in the conjunctiva and the retina have RBPs, suggesting the dependence of these tissues on retinoic acid. Normal fetal development of the eye also requires adequate vitamin A intake and stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A number of studies in vitamin A depleted animals show abnormal fetal eye tissue development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin A</a> deficiency is rarely seen in the United States and other resource-rich countries. However, it is still the third most common nutritional deficiency in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In many resource-limited countries (Southern and Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America), night blindness, complete blindness, and advanced stages of xerophthalmia occur in many malnourished children and adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F101071%7EGAST%2F101072\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101071 graphicRef101072 \">figure 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This represents a major public health problem; approximately 500,000 preschool children become blind each year and many die [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Routine distribution of vitamin A to children in endemic areas prevents these ophthalmic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, one study suggests that vitamin A supplementation to children in undernourished populations reduces the long-term risk of hearing loss among those with ear discharge (a marker for otitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Routine distribution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> to children in endemic areas leads to a modest reduction on childhood mortality, estimated to be between 5 and 15 percent. This was shown in a well-executed cluster-randomized trial (DEVTA trial) that included more than two million children aged five years and younger in North India, a population with a high frequency of vitamin A deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Supplementation for five years with high-dose vitamin A (200,000 International Units every six months, with or without a de-worming protocol) reduced the prevalence of severe vitamin A deficiency and ophthalmopathy, but did not achieve a significant reduction in mortality (mortality ratio 0.96; 95% CI 0.89-1.03). This finding contrasts with previous smaller studies that suggested that periodic vitamin A supplementation yielded a 12 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and a similar reduction in diarrhea-associated mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A meta-analysis that included the DEVTA and eight previous trials yielded a modest weighted average mortality reduction of 11 percent (95% CI 5-16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin A</a> deficiency with or without xerophthalmia can also be seen in resource-rich countries in patients with disorders associated with fat malabsorption, such as cystic fibrosis and other causes of pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, cholestatic liver disease such as primary biliary cholangitis, small bowel Crohn disease, short bowel syndrome, and in patients who have undergone certain types of bariatric surgery. Xerophthalmia also has been reported in individuals with extremely limited diets due to mental health disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with these or other disorders associated with fat malabsorption who experience visual changes, particularly in low light or at night, should be evaluated for vitamin A deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Vitamin A'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> deficiency is usually made by clinical findings, but can be supported by measurement of serum retinol levels (levels less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/dL</span> suggest deficiency), or the ratio of retinol:RBP (a molar ratio &lt;0.8 suggests deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Fasting specimens are preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Serum carotene levels are typically low in patients with vitamin A deficiency, and low serum carotene can be used as a surrogate marker of malabsorption and nutritional status.</p><p>Serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> concentrations do not reflect total vitamin A stores under certain conditions: Serum retinol levels may be artificially low (ie, underestimate vitamin A stores) in the setting of severe protein-calorie malnutrition because dietary protein, energy and zinc are required for synthesis of retinol binding protein (RBP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-vitamin-a/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Similarly, serum retinol levels may be low during intercurrent infection because of transient decreases in the negative acute phase proteins including RBP. Conversely, in a patient with vitamin A deficiency, a dose of vitamin A may cause a transient rise in serum retinol concentrations, leading to overestimation of the patient's vitamin A stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xerophthalmia describes a spectrum of eye disease caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> deficiency.

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Atherosclerosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-supplementation-in-disease-prevention#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin supplementation in disease prevention&quot;, section on 'Vitamin A and the carotenoids'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> toxicity occurs in adults when a single dose of &gt;660,000 units (&gt;200 mg) of vitamin A is ingested. Chronic toxicity occurs with long-term ingestion of vitamin A doses in amounts higher than 10 times the RDA. Preformed vitamin A can have teratogenic effects during the first trimester of pregnancy, at doses of only several times the RDA. Circulating vitamin A concentrations do not consistently reflect vitamin A stores because most vitamin A is stored in the liver; measurement of serum retinyl esters may be helpful.
