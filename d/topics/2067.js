Bipolar disorder can run in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666880\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with bipolar disorder can feel much happier or much sadder than normal. If you have bipolar disorder, you might feel very happy for many days and then feel very sad.</p><p>When your mood is very happy, you can also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get angry quickly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be more active than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel like you have special powers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel like you don't need sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make poor choices without thinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start lots of things and not finish them</p><p/><p>Other times, your mood might be very sad for most of the day, every day. When your mood is very sad, you can also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose or gain a lot of weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble falling asleep or sleep too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not enjoy things</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel bad about yourself</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Think about death or hurting yourself</p><p/><p>People with bipolar disorder might have trouble at work or school. They might not get along well with their family and friends.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666887\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for bipolar disorder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by talking with you and your family. He or she will ask about your mood and what you have been feeling and doing. Your doctor or nurse might also do an exam and order blood tests to look for other problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666894\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bipolar disorder treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bipolar disorder is treated with medicine. Medicines sometimes take a while to start working. Plus, it sometimes takes a few tries to find the right medicine or combination of medicines.</p><p>You and your doctor will work together to find the medicine that works best for you. All of the medicines for bipolar disorder affect the brain. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your mood stable and prevent big mood changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calm your mind</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make your sadness go away</p><p/><p>Medicines sometimes cause side effects.</p><p>You might also need to stay in the hospital for a short time. When a bipolar disorder mood episode starts, you might be at risk of hurting yourself or others. You might hear voices that other people do not hear. You might believe things that are not true. But if you are at the hospital, the doctors can treat these symptoms and keep you safe.</p><p>Some people whose bipolar disorder makes them feel very sad might need &quot;shock treatment&quot; to get better. Doctors call this treatment ECT. During ECT, doctors pass a small amount of electricity (called an &quot;electrical current&quot;) through a person's brain in a safe way. This causes chemical changes in the brain that relieve severe depression.</p><p>In addition to medicine, psychotherapy (counseling) can help. This involves meeting with a therapist to talk about your feelings, thoughts, and life. There are different types of psychotherapy. In general, they all focus on helping you learn new ways of thinking and behaving, so you can better cope with your bipolar disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666901\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to prevent big mood changes in the future?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. After your symptoms have gone away, you will probably:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep taking medicine every day to help prevent big changes in your mood and behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Go to psychotherapy sessions to help you get along better with family and friends</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666908\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, you will need to talk with your doctor. Some medicines for bipolar disorder are OK to take if you are pregnant. Others are not. You might need to slowly reduce or change your medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666915\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with bipolar disorder are able to live normal lives, but they might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have times of feeling very happy or very sad again in the future</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take drugs or drink alcohol. If this happens, talk to your doctor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to hurt themselves. If you ever feel like hurting yourself, call your doctor, go to the hospital, or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46666922\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-manic-depression-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bipolar disorder (manic depression) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
