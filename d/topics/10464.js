As examples, gingival inflammation and scarring may lead to gingival recession and loss of teeth, conjunctival scarring may contribute to blindness, and laryngeal scarring may result in airway loss. </p><p>The treatment of MMP, particularly MMP involving the oral cavity, will be reviewed here. The management of ocular MMP (ocular cicatricial pemphigoid) and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MMP are discussed separately.

Few high quality trials have evaluated interventions for MMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, treatment is largely guided by clinical experience and small uncontrolled studies. Consistent use of the recommended measures for disease activity and treatment outcomes published in 2014 may aid in the systematic interpretation of data from future studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The approach to therapy is influenced by the following clinical factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Site(s) of involvement </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rate of disease progression</p><p/><p>While patients with limited disease of the oral mucosa may be successfully managed with local therapies, patients with even mild involvement of sites associated with a higher risk of serious morbidity (ocular, genital, nasopharyngeal, laryngeal, or esophageal MMP) require systemic agents as initial therapy. Patients with severe or rapidly progressive disease also may benefit from early treatment with systemic agents. (See <a href=\"#H86588898\" class=\"local\">'Extraoral disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After clinical remission is attained, treatment is slowly tapered. The pace of tapering should be slow (eg, over several months) to minimize the risk for disease flares. If discontinuation of all therapy is not possible due to relapses, patients are maintained on the lowest effective topical or systemic maintenance regimen. </p><p>In addition to pharmacologic interventions, proper management of MMP includes consideration of the need for multidisciplinary care. Based upon the sites of known or suspected involvement, co-management between dermatologists, dentists, ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, urologists, internists, gastroenterologists, or colorectal surgeons is often needed. Whenever feasible, patients should be managed by clinicians experienced in the treatment of MMP. (See <a href=\"#H86588898\" class=\"local\">'Extraoral disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86588195\"><span class=\"h1\">ORAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oral cavity is the most common site of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52208%7EDERM%2F63997%7EDERM%2F73874\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52208 graphicRef63997 graphicRef73874 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Our approach to the treatment of oral MMP varies based upon the severity of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid#H53290512\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;, section on 'Mucous membrane pemphigoid'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10872355\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patchy, localized involvement of the oral mucosa and skin can often be treated effectively with local therapy. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line local treatment due to extensive clinical experience with the use of these agents for MMP. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and intralesional corticosteroid injections are additional therapeutic options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15289514\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids, which may be used as monotherapy for patients with mild oral disease or as an adjunct to systemic treatment in patients with more extensive disease, are important components of the therapeutic arsenal. Randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of topical corticosteroids have not been performed. As noted above, clinical experience supports the use of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174265188\"><span class=\"h4\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Class I, super high potency topical corticosteroids (eg, 0.05% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate) in an ointment or gel base are recommended by most experts for treatment of oral MMP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). Gels and ointments can be easily applied to mucosal surfaces and lack the gritty texture of topical corticosteroids formulated in dental pastes that some patients find unpleasant. </p><p>Treatment is applied two to four times per day immediately after the affected areas are dried with soft disposable tissue paper. Drying the mucosa prior to application may enhance the adherence of the medication to the treatment area. Patients should avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes after application.</p><p>We encourage patients to do one of their daily applications immediately before bed since oral secretions are lessened during sleep. This may allow the medication to stay in place for a longer period. </p><p>An alternative mode of topical corticosteroid administration for patients who find the direct application of topical corticosteroids difficult is the use of 5 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> as a swish and spit mouth rinse two to three times per day. Patients treated in this manner should be instructed to avoid swallowing the medication. </p><p>Drug delivery via gingival trays is an additional method of drug administration that can be useful for patients with gingival involvement. The trays aid in the application of topical corticosteroids to lesional sites under occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The gingival tray should be fashioned in soft vinyl and fitted to cover the patient's gingiva (ie, not the patient's teeth). Trays containing topical corticosteroids are left in place for 10 to 20 minutes per treatment.</p><p>Beneficial effects of topical corticosteroid therapy are usually evident within several weeks. If topical corticosteroid therapy is successful, treatment can be tapered slowly (over several months) by reducing the frequency of application and using lower potency agents. In our experience, patients who experience disease flares during topical corticosteroid tapering may benefit from a maintenance regimen in which treatment with a topical corticosteroid is alternated with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (eg, topical tacrolimus applied Monday to Friday and a topical corticosteroid applied on weekends). Intermittent use of topical corticosteroids may help to reduce the risk for corticosteroid side effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1770885\"><span class=\"h4\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of potential adverse effects of topical corticosteroid therapy include mucosal atrophy, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and dyspepsia. Topical or systemic antifungal therapy is effective for secondary candidiasis.

Case reports document marked improvement in oral MMP with topical tacrolimus, including some patients who failed to respond well to topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment initially is applied two to three times per day and is tapered as tolerated. The method of administration mirrors that for topical corticosteroid treatment (see <a href=\"#H174265188\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above). The higher cost of tacrolimus relative to many topical corticosteroids prohibits use of this therapy for some patients.</p><p>A transient burning sensation may occur following the application of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>. In addition, concern has been raised regarding a relationship between the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors and cancer, resulting in the issuing of a public health advisory by the US Food and Drug Administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a causative relationship has not been proven.

Systemic glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> are frequently used to manage these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The local therapies used for mild oral MMP are often prescribed as adjunctive agents.

However, data to support the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoids are limited. Our treatment regimen for systemic glucocorticoids is based upon clinical experience. </p><p>We typically treat patients with 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per day given as a single morning dose. Since long-term treatment with systemic glucocorticoids is unfavorable due to drug-related side effects, we taper and discontinue prednisone within six months, if possible. Topical therapy or a systemic drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil) is used as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent to maintain clinical improvement during and after prednisone tapering. Patients who respond insufficiently to 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone may require higher doses of prednisone or alternative therapies. (See <a href=\"#H10872369\" class=\"local\">'Severe and refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Systemic glucocorticoid therapy may lead to endocrinologic, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and other system abnormalities.

Data on the efficacy of dapsone for oral manifestations of MMP are limited to a few uncontrolled studies and case series in which some patients improved after the initiation of dapsone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>]. As an example, dapsone appeared to be effective in a retrospective study that included 11 patients with MMP localized to the gingiva. Treatment with dapsone (up to 150 mg per day) for at least 12 weeks was associated with major or complete improvement in 10 patients (91 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Additional support for the use of dapsone comes from studies performed in patients with ocular MMP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

The slow dose escalation is accompanied by close laboratory monitoring for adverse effects. </p><p>Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia are pharmacologic side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> that occur in virtually all treated patients. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency have an increased risk for adverse consequences due to these pharmacologic effects of dapsone. We assess for G6PD deficiency prior to initiating treatment. Other potentially severe (and usually rare) adverse effects of dapsone include leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hypersensitivity reactions, and neuropathy (usually motor, though a sensory component may coexist). More common adverse effects include headache, nausea, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue.

Multidisciplinary management is often needed to minimize risk for adverse sequelae of this disease. (See <a href=\"#H10872348\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild oral MMP (patchy, localized involvement of the oral mucosa) may respond well to local therapy. For patients with mild oral MMP, we suggest a high potency topical corticosteroid as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and intralesional corticosteroid injections are additional options for local therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10872355\" class=\"local\">'Mild disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gingival trays may facilitate treatment of patients with significant gingival involvement by allowing application of topical corticosteroids to lesional sites under occlusion. Patients who have difficulty applying topical corticosteroids directly to affected sites may benefit from treatment with a corticosteroid mouth rinse.
