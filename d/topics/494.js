AIDS cholangiopathy occurred in as many as 26 percent of AIDS patients prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]; the current incidence of cholangiopathy is not known, but has decreased in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organism most closely associated with AIDS cholangiopathy is Cryptosporidium parvum; other pathogens that have been identified include Microsporidium, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and <em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/2,6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-10</a>]. Involvement of the large intrahepatic ducts is usually associated with <em>C. parvum</em> and CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AIDS cholangiopathy is usually seen in patients with a CD4 count well below <span class=\"nowrap\">100/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and may be their presenting manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Affected patients typically present with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain and diarrhea; fever and jaundice are less common, occurring in 10 to 20 percent of patients. The severity of the abdominal pain varies with the biliary tract lesion. Severe abdominal pain is indicative of papillary stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], while milder abdominal pain is usually associated with intrahepatic and extrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis without papillary stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58521\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58521 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The diarrhea in AIDS cholangiopathy is due to small bowel involvement with the infectious agent and may be the initial presenting feature. In one study of 95 patients with diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium, 20 (23 percent) subsequently developed biliary tract disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver function tests in AIDS cholangiopathy are usually indicative of cholestasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-adult-with-jaundice-or-asymptomatic-hyperbilirubinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the adult with jaundice or asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia&quot;</a>.) In one series, for example, the following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum gammaglutamyl transpeptidase was persistently elevated in over 90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 75 percent with a mean level of 700 to 800 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were common</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice, when present, was usually mild, with total bilirubin less than twice the upper limit of normal</p><p/><p>However, all of these tests are normal in some patients (20 percent in one series) despite documented biliary tract abnormalities seen on cholangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Furthermore, liver test abnormalities are present in the majority of patients with established AIDS due to opportunistic infections, viral hepatitis, drug hepatotoxicity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of AIDS cholangiopathy is usually made by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, other studies can be helpful in early evaluation and in selecting patients for ERCP. Ultrasound is the most cost-effective initial study, with a sensitivity for cholangitis ranging from 75 to 97 percent and specificity of up to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/6,8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,16</a>]. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is also used to study biliary tract disease, and although there are no studies in HIV cholangiopathy, MRCP represents another useful screening examination for identification of bile duct strictures. In one report, 50 patients with suspected AIDS cholangiopathy due to right upper quadrant pain and cholestatic liver function tests were studied with ultrasound and ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal ultrasound findings were noted in 18 patients, 17 of whom subsequently had a normal ERCP, while the other patient had changes suggestive of mild cholangiopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 32 patients with abnormal findings on ultrasound, all had abnormalities on ERCP: 22 had typical changes of cholangiopathy; and 10 had a variety of other conditions including pancreatitis, biliary calculi, and AIDS-related lymphoma.</p><p/><p>Thus, ERCP is the recommended procedure in the patient with suspected AIDS cholangiopathy and a positive ultrasound. It allows confirmation of the diagnosis and the performance of therapeutic procedures, if indicated. Biliary brushings and biopsy, biliary aspiration, and small bowel biopsy can also be performed to aid in diagnosis. This includes detection of the etiologic agent using appropriate stains.</p><p>As noted above, the likelihood of finding anatomic abnormalities at ERCP in the patient with a negative ultrasound is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, ERCP is indicated in this setting if the patient has symptoms suggestive of papillary stenosis, particularly severe abdominal pain, or known Cryptosporidium or CMV infection.</p><p>Cholangiography reveals one of four patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/2,6,8,11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,11,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined papillary stenosis and sclerosing cholangitis &ndash; 50 to 60 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined intrahepatic and extrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis without papillary stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58521\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58521 \">image 1</a>) &ndash; 20 percent or less</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papillary stenosis alone &ndash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long extrahepatic bile duct stricture with or without intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis is unusual</p><p/><p>The combination of papillary stenosis and intrahepatic ductal strictures appears relatively unique to AIDS cholangiopathy; this combination is not found in primary sclerosing cholangitis. In patients with papillary stenosis, pancreatic abnormalities (such as pancreatic duct dilatation) are frequently seen with pancreatograms and may be responsible for some of the abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Other imaging studies are occasionally useful in patients with possible AIDS cholangiopathy to exclude other possible causes of abnormal liver tests. Computed tomography (CT) is helpful in jaundiced patients to look for intrahepatic masses, abdominal adenopathy, pancreatic disease and gallbladder and biliary abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A hepatobiliary imino-diacetic acid (HIDA) scan may show delayed excretion of the tracer, suggesting biliary obstruction, or may demonstrate focal biliary strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography has not been well studied in patients with AIDS cholangiopathy but can probably provide similar information as ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although infection is the most common cause of AIDS cholangiopathy, medical treatment directed against <em>C. parvum</em>, Microsporidium, or CMV does not influence symptoms or cholangiographic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/10,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13</a>]. The therapy of AIDS cholangiopathy is primarily endoscopic, and the approach varies with the anatomic abnormality.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have abdominal pain, cholangitis, or jaundice associated with papillary stenosis show marked symptomatic relief after sphincterotomy. The relief can be long-lasting; the frequency with which this occurs has varied from 23 percent to 70 to 100 percent in different studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/2,6,11,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,11,12,15</a>]. However, serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations are stable or may continue to rise, a probable reflection of progression of intrahepatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated or dominant common bile duct strictures can be treated with endoscopic stenting. Sphincterotomy does not help patients with sclerosing cholangitis in the absence of papillary stenosis.

This observation has led to its experimental use in patients with AIDS cholangiopathy; results in a small number of patients have found an improvement in symptoms and a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We suggest giving UDCA in a dose 300 mg three times daily, primarily in patients who have intrahepatic ductal disease and markedly elevated liver tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The survival of patients is not affected by cholangiopathy, since the mortality rate is primarily determined by the natural history of AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/2,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,10</a>]. An isolated report described the development of cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Because cholangiopathy typically occurs in patients with advanced AIDS (CD4 cell count below <span class=\"nowrap\">100/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> the mean survival has been only 7 to 12 months. In one series of 45 patients, for example, one- and two-year survival rates were 41 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a retrospective study of 82 AIDS patients who developed cryptosporidiosis from contaminated water in Milwaukee, those who had biliary symptoms were significantly more likely to die than HIV-infected patients without these symptoms during the following year (83 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aids-cholangiopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, these studies were performed prior to the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). The use of ART has a definite benefit in the treatment of enteric infections due to Cryptosporidium or Microsporidium; it is not known if this type of aggressive treatment will also favorably affect the outcome of AIDS cholangiopathy. As noted above, it appears that the incidence of AIDS cholangiopathy has declined since the introduction of ART. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microsporidiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microsporidiosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS cholangiopathy is a syndrome of biliary obstruction resulting from infection-associated strictures of the biliary tract, usually seen in patients with a CD4 count well below <span class=\"nowrap\">100/mm<sup>3</sup></span>.
