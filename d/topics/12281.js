By convention, acute disease is distinguished from chronic disease at an arbitrary time point of two weeks from initial clinical presentation (hyperacute: &lt;24 hours, acute: 1 to 14 days, subacute: &gt;14 to 90 days, chronic: &gt;90 days) and typically manifests with symptoms. Acute aortic dissection is the most familiar and is defined by a separation of the layers of the aortic wall by an inciting intimal injury. Intimal tear without hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, aortic intramural hematoma, and periaortic hematoma are variants of the classically described aortic dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62132\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62132 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The changes associated with these are more localized, though they are similar to those of aortic dissection, with penetration and weakening of the aortic wall that predisposes to aortic rupture, which may manifest as a contained periaortic hematoma or free rupture into the chest or abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each of these conditions can affect the thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and, in some cases, both. </p><p>The clinical features, classification, diagnosis, and approach to treatment of acute aortic syndromes including acute aortic dissection, which is also discussed in detail elsewhere; aortic intramural hematoma; and penetrating aortic ulcer are reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561897621\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H229423462\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute aortic dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute aortic dissection is defined as a separation of the layers of the aortic wall due to an intimal tear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62132\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62132 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478585083\"><span class=\"h3\">Spontaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For spontaneous dissection, it is uncertain whether the initiating event is a primary rupture of the intima with secondary dissection of the media or primary hemorrhage within the media and subsequent rupture of the overlying intima [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The initial intimal tear can occur in the ascending aorta or descending aorta and occasionally can originate in the abdominal aorta. Blood at high pressure passes through the tear and separates the intima from the media <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adventitia, creating a true lumen and a false lumen. The dissection can propagate proximally or distally from the initial tear to involve the aortic valve, coronary arteries, or branches of the thoracic or abdominal aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Such propagation is responsible for many of the associated clinical features of aortic dissection (acute chest or back pain, neurologic symptoms). A higher mean pressure in the false lumen can cause dynamic or static compression and occlusion of the true lumen with malperfusion of the branches of the aorta, resulting in end-organ ischemia (coronary, cerebral, spinal, extremity, visceral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Aortic regurgitation, coronary ischemia, and cardiac tamponade can occur if the dissection progresses proximally to involve the aortic valve or the pericardial sac. In addition, multiple communications may form between the true lumen and the false lumen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection#H87661002\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal aortic dissection can occur as an extension to a thoracic aortic dissection with the intimal flap located in the proximal or descending thoracic aorta, or it can occur in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. Isolated abdominal aortic dissection is reported occasionally and can be due to spontaneous, iatrogenic, or traumatic mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The infrarenal abdominal aorta is more commonly involved than the suprarenal aorta. In one review of 52 reported cases, the entry site for spontaneous isolated abdominal aortic dissections (SIAADs) most commonly occurred between the renal arteries and inferior mesenteric artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm was identified in 40 percent of patients and indicated the need for repair.

Iatrogenic or traumatic injury (eg, intra-aortic balloon pump placement, motor vehicle accident) was responsible for 6 percent of cases of aortic intramural hematoma in one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The absence of an intimal lesion distinguishes aortic intramural hematoma from the hematoma that may be associated with a penetrating aortic ulcer, for which there is a clear break in the intima. Aortic intramural hematoma can be a precursor to acute aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In different series, aortic intramural hematoma accounted for 5 to 20 percent of patients with symptoms consistent with an aortic dissection (eg, acute aortic syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism by which an intramural hematoma is created is not certain. Two mechanisms have been described: rupture induced by a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer and spontaneous rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Spontaneous rupture of the vasa vasorum as a pathogenesis has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In this scenario, the false lumen originates from spontaneous rupture of the vasa vasorum into the media of the aortic wall. Because there is no continuous flow, the blood contained within the wall quickly thromboses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64205\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64205 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Some believe that intramural hematoma represents acute aortic dissection with thrombosis of the false lumen and that an intimal tear is always present whether or not it is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Intimal defects have been identified surgically and radiographically in approximately 70 percent of cases initially diagnosed as an intramural hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, there appears to be a difference in the affected plane of the aortic media. For intramural hematoma, the outer media (toward the adventitia) is thinner, which may explain the higher risk of rupture for intramural hematoma compared with acute dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].

There is no separation of the medial layers or progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2809572650\"><span class=\"h2\">Penetrating aortic ulcer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penetrating aortic ulcer refers to a region of the aorta (ulcer-like projection) where the aortic intima is denuded with the lesion progressing through a variable amount of the aortic wall, over which there may or may not be overlying thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Penetrating aortic ulcers are typically associated with atherosclerotic changes of the adjacent aortic wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Penetrating aortic ulcer may be associated with hematoma within the media and may progress to perforation or aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/2,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32-34</a>].

Periaortic hematoma is more common in aortic intramural hematoma compared with acute aortic dissection. In a review of 971 patients with acute dissections from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissections (IRAD), 227 (23 percent) had a periaortic hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Acute aortic syndromes are further classified by clinical features, including the absence or presence of symptoms and whether disease becomes complicated. The nature of the complications differs for each variant, but each has the potential to cause life- or limb-threatening complications. (See <a href=\"#H3993661513\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>For aortic dissection, two different anatomic classification systems, the DeBakey and Daily (Stanford) systems, have been used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The Stanford system is the more widely used of these and will be used in this review. The variants of aortic dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62132\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62132 \">figure 1</a>), intimal tear without hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, aortic intramural hematoma, and periaortic hematoma can also be described in a similar manner based upon the location of the aortic abnormality. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Stanford system classifies aortic dissections that involve the ascending aorta as type A, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear, and all other dissections as type B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/2,5,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,37,38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DeBakey system is based upon the site of the origin of the tear, with type 1 originating in the ascending aorta and propagating to at least the aortic arch, type 2 originating in and confined to the ascending aorta, and type 3 originating in the descending aorta and extending distally or proximally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/3,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,39,40</a>].</p><p/><p>Ascending aortic dissections are almost twice as common as descending dissections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/27,30,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30,41</a>].

Risk factors associated with acute aortic dissection include hypertension (including that mediated by cocaine or other mechanisms), atherosclerosis, prior cardiac surgery, known aneurysm, known connective tissue disorder (eg, Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome), bicuspid aortic valve, and prior aortic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/39,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,52</a>].

The pain is described as severe, sharp, or &quot;tearing&quot; and is located in the anterior chest pain for type A aortic dissection and in the posterior chest or back pain for type B aortic dissection.

It is highly sensitive and specific for imaging aortic pathology. The study should include the entire aorta, including the iliac and femoral vessels. Other imaging modalities such as transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be useful in hemodynamically unstable patients. Both TTE and TEE can identify aortic valve regurgitation, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and tamponade, and regional wall motion abnormalities. However, complete imaging of the distal arch and descending aorta is limited with TTE, and these may not be diagnostic for intramural hematoma. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is seldom used due to the wider availability of CT in the emergency department; catheter-based arteriography is rarely necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>The imaging diagnosis of aortic dissection by CT scanning requires the identification of two distinct lumens; the intimal flap may or may not be demonstrated. The presence of intraluminal thrombus is a good marker of the false lumen, especially in the chronic phase. In the majority of cases, the false lumen is larger than the true lumen.

However, the appearance of an aortic intramural hematoma and an acute dissection with complete thrombosis of the false lumen is similar, and an aortic intramural hematoma may be difficult to identify correctly.

Rupture of the dissected aorta is fortunately uncommon but is an ominous complication with certain mortality unless prompt surgical intervention can be undertaken. The development of malperfusion in type A aortic dissection is associated with mortality rates up to 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acute-aortic-dissection-and-other-acute-aortic-syndromes/abstract/73,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,83,84</a>]. In one IRAD study, 87 to 90 percent of patients with acute type A aortic dissections were able to initially be treated surgically.

In spite of other improvements in patient care, the in-hospital mortality rate for type A aortic dissection has remained at approximately 20 percent over the past 20 years. Repair of type A aortic dissection involves replacement of the ascending aorta, resection of intimal tears and aneurysmal aorta, and either restoring the competency of or replacing the aortic valve.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1561897621\" class=\"local\">'Definition and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aortic dissection is defined as a separation of the layers of the aortic wall due to an intimal tear. Acute aortic dissection comprises the majority of acute aortic syndromes. Aortic dissection can be spontaneous, iatrogenic, or traumatic. Spontaneous ascending aortic dissections are almost twice as common as descending aortic dissections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aortic intramural hematoma is defined as a collection of blood confined within the medial layer of the aorta in the absence of a detectable intimal tear. It can be a precursor to acute aortic dissection and may be associated with penetrating aortic ulcer. Aortic intramural hematoma can also be due to aortic injury, which may be iatrogenic (eg, intra-aortic balloon pump) or traumatic (eg, auto accident). Aortic intramural hematoma more commonly involves the descending aorta. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intimal tear without hematoma is characterized by a stellate or linear intimal tear associated with exposure of the underlying aortic media or adventitia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Penetrating aortic ulcer is a region where the aortic intima is denuded with the lesion progressing through a variable amount of the aortic wall. Most penetrating aortic ulcers are located in the descending thoracic aorta. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Periaortic hematoma represents a contained aortic rupture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute aortic syndromes are classified according to the location and extent of involvement of the aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100115\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100115 \">figure 2</a>). The Stanford system, which is the more widely used, classifies aortic dissections that involve the ascending aorta as type A, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear, and all other dissections as type B. The variants of aortic dissection, intimal tear without hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer, aortic intramural hematoma, and periaortic hematoma can be described in a similar manner. (See <a href=\"#H1708752646\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain is the most common presenting symptom of acute aortic syndromes. Anterior chest pain is more typical of ascending (type A) lesions, while upper or lower back pain is more common with descending (type B) lesions. Other manifestations seen with type A aortic dissections, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic regurgitation, syncope, and paraplegia, are less common manifestations of the other acute aortic syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H3993661513\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since clinical manifestations are nonspecific, the diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes relies on imaging studies to define the aortic abnormality, classify the location and extent, and identify any anatomic complications. A crucial aspect of early therapy is ensuring a correct diagnosis so that the appropriate management scheme can be instituted in a timely fashion. Imaging modalities that can be used to make the diagnosis include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography of the chest (with or without contrast) and transesophageal echocardiography. Exclusion of an intimal flap is a prerequisite for the radiologic diagnosis of aortic intramural hematoma. Imaging may also identify a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer as the etiology of aortic intramural hematoma. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The general principles of medical treatment of acute aortic syndromes are similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111189 \">table 2</a>) and include pain control and anti-impulse therapy to reduce the rate of progression, which should be initiated for all patients unless hypotension is present but should not interfere with the timely transfer to the operating room for those with indications for immediate aortic repair. (See <a href=\"#H2422133176\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intravenous beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>) are typically used as initial anti-impulse therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F111803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111803 \">table 3</a>). Intravenous sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> can be added if the systolic blood pressure remains above 100 mmHg, provided mentation and renal function are intact. Nitroprusside should <strong>not</strong> be used without beta blockade since vasodilation induces reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to enhanced ventricular contraction and aortic shear stress. (See <a href=\"#H1628662340\" class=\"local\">'Acute medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For type A acute aortic syndromes, the definitive treatment is surgical. Surgery may not be feasible in patients of advanced age or other comorbid conditions, and these patients are managed medically. Compared with patients with classic ascending aortic dissection who are treated medically, patients with type A aortic intramural hematoma have a better prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H4052559896\" class=\"local\">'Ascending aorta (type A)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-aortic-dissection#H4173117745\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Ascending (type A) aortic dissection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For type B acute aortic syndromes, the treatment is generally medical, with surgery reserved for those experiencing complications or refractory or progressive symptoms. For most patients with complicated type B lesions, we suggest an initial endovascular approach, rather than open surgery, provided the patient's anatomy is suitable for endograft placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Perioperative morbidity and mortality is lower for an endovascular compared with open surgical approach. However, patients with genetically mediated thoracic aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysm/dissection</span> affecting the descending thoracic aorta who have complications should be managed using open surgical techniques.
