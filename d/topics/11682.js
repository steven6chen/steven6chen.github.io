The goal of monitoring is to alert the surgeon and anesthesiologist to impending injury in order to allow modification of management in time to prevent permanent damage. In some cases, neuromonitoring is used to map areas of the nervous system in order to guide management.</p><p>Neuromonitoring can include the recording of spontaneous activity (eg, electroencephalogram and spontaneous electromyogram) or evoked response to stimulus (eg, somatosensory evoked potentials, motor evoked potentials, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials). Frequently, multiple techniques are used together in order to increase the utility of monitoring and to overcome limitations of individual techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Neuromonitoring has become common during many surgical procedures, often replacing intraoperative wake-up testing. Neuromonitoring is performed by a specialized team with specific expertise in the technique that is used. In most instances, no &quot;standard of care&quot; exists for intraoperative neuromonitoring, and techniques are chosen by the surgeon and monitoring team in order to assess or protect structures at risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101913 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will present an overview of neuromonitoring techniques, the effects of anesthetic agents on recorded signals, and the strategy for responding to electrophysiological changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106186\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs), and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are electrophysiologic monitoring techniques that are commonly used in the operating room to improve surgical decision-making and possibly reduce neurologic complications in both adult and pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/3-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106192\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroencephalography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EEG records electrical activity in the cerebral cortex and can detect ischemia and seizure activity, as well as assess the impact of the anesthetic agents on the brain.</p><p>Most often, electrodes are placed on the scalp in a standardized array prior to surgery. Each scalp electrode gives a continuous recording of spontaneous superficial brain activity two to three centimeters in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Occasionally, EEG electrodes are placed intraoperatively on the surface of the brain during seizure surgery, during awake brain mapping, and for selected tumor resections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H508068549\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Routine EEG technique'</a>.)</p><p>Reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) produce rapid, characteristic changes in the EEG. With ischemia, progressive decrease in synaptic activity results in loss of high-frequency activity, loss of power, and ultimately EEG silence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The severity of neurologic injury and expected EEG changes with decreasing cerebral blood flow are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101914\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101914 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>EEG monitoring is often used during carotid endarterectomy in order to assess cerebral perfusion during carotid crossclamping. In this setting, EEG slowing or asymmetry between the recordings on the operative and contralateral sides can provide evidence of ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-carotid-endarterectomy-and-carotid-stenting#H1643653038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalography (EEG) with general anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>EEG can also be used during intracranial surgery in order to evaluate the cortex for ischemia. A limitation of EEG monitoring is that surface EEG recordings do not detect ischemia in subcortical regions. EEG monitoring for carotid endarterectomy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-carotid-endarterectomy-and-carotid-stenting#H1643653038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting&quot;, section on 'Electroencephalography (EEG) with general anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>If pharmacologic methods are used for metabolic suppression, EEG monitoring can confirm burst suppression, but monitoring for ischemia is then precluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>EEG monitoring for the depth of anesthetic effect is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=awareness-with-recall-following-general-anesthesia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Awareness with recall following general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Neuromonitoring'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106198\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMG is used to monitor muscle activity, either by spontaneous or evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). EMG is monitored in muscles innervated by cranial or spinal nerves that are at risk during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Continuous, free-running EMG (often called &quot;spontaneous EMG&quot;) can identify stretch or blunt mechanical trauma to cranial nerves or spinal roots, which can produce high-frequency trains called neurotonic discharges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101915\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101915 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Muscle innervated by nonirritated and nonstimulated nerves should otherwise be quiet in their activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stimulus-triggered EMG (often called &quot;triggered EMG&quot;) can help identify intact nerves. During tumor resection, triggered EMG is used to identify a nerve in order to avoid cutting or coagulating it. A mono- or bipolar stimulator is used within the surgical site to stimulate the nerve, and a resulting CMAP is recorded from the innervated muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101915\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101915 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/17,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27,28</a>]. An increase in the latency between stimulus and CMAP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a reduction in the amplitude of the CMAP may indicate nerve injury. This technique is analogous to surface stimulation and measurement of CMAP performed as part of a diagnostic nerve conduction study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;, section on 'Motor nerve conduction'</a>.)</p><p>EMG is commonly used in spine surgery involving instrumentation in order to help prevent postoperative radiculopathy (a more common complication than spinal cord injury) by identifying nerve irritation before injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>]. Multiple muscles are usually monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. EMG triggered by stimulation of pedicle screws or pilot holes can be used to identify malpositioned screws that are too close to nerve roots.</p><p>Cranial nerve monitoring, which is utilized during acoustic neuroma and cerebellopontine angle tumor resections, microvascular decompression, skull base surgeries, thyroid and parotid procedures, and radical neck dissection, is a form of EMG, or intraoperative nerve conduction study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Only cranial nerves with a motor component can be monitored with EMG (ie, cranial nerves III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII).</p><p>Stimulus-triggered EMG can also be used for brainstem and motor-strip mapping during intracranial tumor surgery. For example, when anatomy is distorted by tumor, brainstem mapping can be performed by recording muscle activity that results from stimulation of cranial nerve motor nuclei using a hand-held stimulation probe. Stimulation can also be used to identify the motor cortex by recording EMG activity from the impacted area (eg, upper extremity, lower extremity, or face) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H426642131\"><span class=\"h2\">Evoked potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evoked potential monitoring is used to assess the integrity of the tested neural pathway. Somatosensory, visual, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials used to monitor neurologic structures between peripheral sites where specific stimulations are applied, and responses are recorded from central locations. Motor evoked potentials monitor such structures by stimulating the motor cortex and recording from the epidural space (D-wave) or, more commonly, from distal muscles. Changes in evoked responses can result from technical, positional, pharmacologic, physiologic, or surgical causes. (See <a href=\"#H3106246\" class=\"local\">'Managing electrophysiologic changes'</a> below.)</p><p>Morphology of the recorded waveform depends both on the site used for stimulation and the site used for recording. The amplitude and latency of the waveform can be analyzed to provide functional neurologic assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101916\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101916 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Amplitude is measured peak-to-trough in microvolts, and latency is measured from stimulus application to peak appearance in milliseconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Loss of or change in the waveform can indicate the need for modification of surgical strategy, patient positioning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient physiologic management in order to prevent or minimize neurologic system injury. (See <a href=\"#H3106246\" class=\"local\">'Managing electrophysiologic changes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106204\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatosensory evoked potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SSEP is the most commonly used evoked potential monitoring modality in the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. An electrical stimulus is applied to a peripheral nerve, typically the median or ulnar nerve at the wrist for upper extremity SSEPs and the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle for lower extremity SSEPs, using needle or surface electrodes near the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Motor and sensory components of these large, mixed nerves are stimulated. Activation of the motor components results in visible muscle twitches in distal musculature (confirming stimulation and lack of significant muscle blockade), while activation of the sensory components results in responses that travel along the sensory pathway and ascend to the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101918 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The monitored neural pathway includes the dorsal root ganglia and the dorsal or posterior column of the spinal cord. Therefore, SSEP monitoring is particularly useful during posterior spine surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Most commonly, responses are recorded over Erb's point, the popliteal fossa, the cervical spine, and the sensory cortex. However, responses can also be recorded at other points along the pathway, including over the peripheral nerves and spinal cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101918 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Recordings are obtained with an electrode pair called a &quot;recording montage&quot; (an active electrode and a reference electrode) to measure the voltage between the two sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The sensory cortex is monitored with scalp EEG electrodes placed according to the International 10&ndash;20 System of EEG electrode placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>]. A decrease in waveform amplitude and an increase in latency may indicate neurologic dysfunction, such as from surgical injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Specifically, a 50 percent reduction in amplitude or a 10 percent increase in latency in SSEPs, MEPs, and BAEPs is considered pathologic.</p><p>SSEPs are used in a variety of spine, intracranial, endovascular, and cardiovascular surgeries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101913 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106210\"><span class=\"h3\">Brainstem auditory evoked potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs), also known as brainstem auditory evoked responses or auditory brainstem responses, are specialized sensory evoked potentials. An acoustic stimulus (a loud, repetitive click) is made in the ear canal using an ear insert device. The sound is transduced by ear structures, with information conducted to the brainstem via the eighth cranial nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. Recording electrodes are placed at the head near the ear (ie, mastoid process or ear lobe). Five main short-latency peaks (I to V) are usually seen within the first 10 milliseconds after stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Evaluation of BAEPs usually focuses on waves I, III, and V, which are thought to be generated near specific brainstem structures. Wave I is from cranial nerve VIII, wave III from the lower pons, and wave V from near the inferior colliculus (mesencephalon) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101920 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/3,33,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33,37,38</a>].</p><p>BAEPs are used during posterior fossa surgeries to help assess brainstem function and preserve hearing when it is at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/33,35,37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35,37,39,40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106216\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual evoked potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are specialized sensory evoked potentials of the visual pathway recorded from the visual cortex after flash stimulation of the retina through closed eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/35,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41,42</a>].</p><p>Usefulness of VEP monitoring has not been established, and concerns have been raised that traditional stimulation methods do not produce responses that follow the pathway of useful vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/41,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43-45</a>]. Also, VEPs are susceptible to effects from general anesthetics, and technical problems with stimulators make monitoring difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/33,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106222\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor evoked potentials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MEPs can be obtained by magnetic stimulation or, more commonly, by transcranial electrical stimulation, either to the scalp utilizing two needles or by direct stimulation of the surface of the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101923\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101923 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>].</p><p>Stimulation of the pyramidal and internuncial cells in the brain generate D (direct) and I (indirect) waves recorded from the epidural space; however, responses are most commonly recorded as compound muscle action potentials in peripheral muscle groups. For the upper extremity, the adductor pollicis brevis is usually monitored, while the tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abductor hallucis are monitored for the lower extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, MEPs monitor the corticospinal tract (ie, motor cortex, corticospinal tract, nerve root, and peripheral nerve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>MEP can also be monitored as epidural D-waves. These are recorded from an epidural electrode and are specific for the corticospinal tract, but they do not differentiate laterality. The electrodes can be placed percutaneously, but they are usually placed by the surgeon in the operative field. This technique is most often used in intramedullary spinal cord tumor surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/20,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,46</a>].</p><p>For spine surgery, both MEPs and SSEPs are used to monitor spinal cord function to increase sensitivity. Motor and sensory tracts are anatomically distinct and have different vascular supply in areas of the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>].</p><p>MEPs are monitored periodically throughout surgery and more frequently during critical surgical maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As with the other evoked response techniques, the amplitude and latency of the response are monitored; a decrease in amplitude is a more common sign of impending neurologic compromise than an increase in latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Several criteria have been proposed for identifying significant intraoperative change; complete loss of signal is always considered significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/2,3,18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,18,22</a>]. MEPs are more effective than SSEPs for detecting motor injury since changes in the MEPs precede SSEP changes, usually allowing time to react in order to prevent neurologic damage.</p><p>Transcranial stimulation for MEP monitoring activates the muscles of mastication. After induction of anesthesia, a soft bite block must be placed between the molars, making sure that the tongue and cheek are clear of the teeth. Severe tongue and cheek injuries are possible with repeated stimulation during surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The bite block must be checked again for proper positioning when the patient is turned prone for spine surgery and periodically throughout the surgery. </p><p>A number of patient factors can make MEP recording difficult, especially for the lower extremity, including diabetic neuropathy, hypertension, age extremes, and preoperative motor deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106228\"><span class=\"h3\">H-reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative H-reflex monitoring can be used as an adjunct to motor tract assessment. The H-reflex is a true reflex with an afferent arc mediated by large, fast-conducting group 1a fibers, and an efferent arc mediated by alpha motor neurons. It is elicited by electrical stimulation of an afferent mixed peripheral nerve and by then recording the muscle response. Most commonly, the tibial nerve is stimulated, with recording from the gastrocnemius or soleus muscles. The H-reflex can be monitored below the level where the spinal cord ends (where MEPs may be less useful) and in some patients in whom MEP cannot be monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromonitoring-in-surgery-and-anesthesia/abstract/13,24,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24,50,51</a>].

In general, inhalational agents have greater effects on all modes of neuromonitoring than do intravenous (IV) anesthetic agents. Choice and dose of anesthetic agents should be tailored to the modalities used.

The following steps provide a framework for approaching a neuromonitoring change. However, a modified approach should be followed during certain surgical steps, such as temporary or permanent aneurysm clipping or placement of spinal instrumentation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirm the change</strong> &ndash; When encountered, neurophysiologic changes should be reconfirmed by another signal acquisition (if time allows) before a call for action is initiated. Changes in other monitored modalities will also help in the evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alert the team</strong> &ndash; Management of a change in neuromonitoring should be a team effort. The surgeon, anesthesiologist, and neuromonitoring personnel will all play a role in diagnosis and management. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Troubleshoot the cause</strong> &ndash; Depending on the monitoring modality in use, the differential diagnosis may be narrowed by identifying the change as cortical versus subcortical, unilateral versus bilateral, and focal versus global. In general, surgical, technical, and positional etiologies result in more localized changes, while anesthesia and physiologic etiologies tend to result in more global effects on neuromonitoring. However, anesthesia-related changes in evoked potentials may be more pronounced on the side of preexisting asymmetric neurologic deficits (eg, nerve root compression or unilateral spinal cord pathology). The temporal relationship between monitoring changes and surgical and anesthesia maneuvers may also help with diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At certain stages of surgery, such as temporary or permanent clipping during cerebral aneurysm surgery, spinal instrumentation, or crossclamping of the carotid, surgical causes are very high on the list for differential diagnosis. Since prompt correction of etiology of change is necessary in order to avoid neurologic deficit, it is important not to waste precious time on unlikely causes of the change. This is why it is important at such stages not to make anesthetic changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Optimize physiology</strong> &ndash; While the cause is being investigated, the anesthesiologist can help minimize potential neurologic injury by optimizing physiologic variables (eg, raise blood pressure if appropriate, increase fraction of inspired oxygen). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Correct the cause</strong> &ndash; If the cause is identified, it should be corrected, when possible. Further treatment may depend on subsequent monitoring and the clinical situation. Some examples include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If evoked potentials deteriorate during positioning for cervical spine surgery, the head may be repositioned, and, if the potentials do not recover, the patient may be awoken for neurologic exam and the surgery aborted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If hypotension or relative hypotension is the cause, increase blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If EEG or SSEP changes occur with carotid crossclamping during carotid endarterectomy, a shunt should be placed expeditiously and the blood pressure should be raised immediately.

It is commonly used during carotid endarterectomy in order to assess cerebral perfusion during carotid crossclamping. (See <a href=\"#H3106192\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electromyography (EMG) is used to monitor spontaneous muscle activity or evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) in muscles innervated by cranial or spinal nerve roots that are at risk during surgery. Triggered EMG is used during surgery in order to monitor nerve integrity. These techniques are commonly used during posterior fossa and spine surgery, as well as during cortical and brainstem motor mapping. (See <a href=\"#H3106198\" class=\"local\">'Electromyography'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) are the most commonly employed evoked potential monitoring modality in the operating room, and SSEPs are often used to monitor the sensory pathway in spine and intracranial surgeries. (See <a href=\"#H3106204\" class=\"local\">'Somatosensory evoked potentials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) are primarily used intraoperatively during posterior fossa surgeries in order to help assess brainstem function and preserve hearing when it is at risk. Compared with other intraoperative neuromonitoring modalities, BAEPs are very resistant to general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H3106210\" class=\"local\">'Brainstem auditory evoked potentials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) monitor the corticospinal tract. MEPs are monitored along with SSEPs during intracranial and spine surgery. MEPs can detect ischemia in an area of the brain that is not covered by SSEPs. Changes in MEPs occur earlier than SSEP changes, which may allow more rapid correction of the cause and possible prevention of neurologic injuries. (See <a href=\"#H3106222\" class=\"local\">'Motor evoked potentials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic agents can affect neuromonitoring. In general, evoked responses are affected more by volatile inhalational agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>) and by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) than by intravenous (IV) agents. MEPs are very sensitive to inhalation agents, SSEPs are moderately affected, and BAEPs are resistant to the effects of inhalation anesthetics. The level of anesthesia should be kept constant during critical monitoring periods in order to avoid confounding the interpretation of changes. (See <a href=\"#H3106240\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic effects on neuromonitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) affect EMG and MEP recording. NMBAs should be avoided during EMG monitoring. If NMBAs are used during MEP monitoring, the degree of neuromuscular blockade should be monitored using a train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimulator, aiming for a constant level of paralysis at two of four twitches or single twitch 10 to 20 percent of baseline. (See <a href=\"#H601409830\" class=\"local\">'Neuromuscular blocking agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a neuromonitoring change occurs, surgical, anesthetic, physiologic, positional, and technical causes should be investigated using a team approach.
