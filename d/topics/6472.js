People can get an esophageal stricture if they have had a disorder called &quot;gastroesophageal reflux disease&quot; (also called GERD) for a long time. In people with GERD, acid from the stomach backs up into the esophagus. Over time, the acid can scar the esophagus and make it more narrow.</p><p>Other causes of esophageal stricture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous surgery on the esophagus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swallowing a substance that harms the esophagus, such as household cleaners, lye, or disc-shaped batteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for esophageal varices (enlarged veins in the esophagus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An allergic condition called &quot;eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27271346\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of esophageal stricture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is having trouble swallowing. Doctors call this &quot;dysphagia.&quot; You might also feel like your food or pills are getting stuck in your throat. At first, you might have trouble swallowing only when you eat solid foods. But as the condition gets worse, you can have trouble swallowing liquids.</p><p>If you have acid reflux, you might also have symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A burning feeling in the chest, known as heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the throat or an acid taste in the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach or chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A raspy voice or a sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough for no reason</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27271361\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for esophageal stricture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks you might have an esophageal stricture, he or she will probably order one or both of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Barium</a> swallow &ndash; For this test you eat a special meal that shows up on X-ray. Then you have X-rays taken to see if the barium gets stuck or slowed down on the way down your esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin tube down your throat and into your stomach. The tube (called an &quot;endoscope&quot;) has a light and a tiny camera on the end. It allows the doctor or nurse to see inside your esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27271376\"><span class=\"h1\">How is esophageal stricture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for esophageal stricture is a procedure to widen the esophagus called &quot;esophageal dilation.&quot; This is usually done during an endoscopy.</p><p>If you are having esophageal dilation, you will get medicines to help you relax. Then the doctor can do the dilation in 1 of 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using solid flexible tubes &ndash; For this procedure, the doctor puts a series of solid flexible tubes down your throat. He or she starts with a very narrow size and then inserts wider and wider ones until the esophagus is stretched open.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a balloon &ndash; For this procedure, the doctor puts a tube with balloon on it through the endoscope into your esophagus. The balloon is then inflated to stretch the narrow part of the esophagus.</p><p/><p>After having esophageal dilation, most people also need to start taking a medicine called a &quot;proton pump inhibitor&quot; (also called a PPI). PPIs stop the stomach from making acid and can help the esophagus heal and keep the stricture from coming back. PPIs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">omeprazole</a> (brand name: Prilosec), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">esomeprazole</a> (brand name: Nexium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lansoprazole</a> (brand name: Prevacid), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pantoprazole</a> (brand name: Protonix), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rabeprazole</a> (brand name: AcipHex). Some PPIs are sold without a prescription.</p><p>Some people need more than one dilation if the esophagus is very narrow or if symptoms come back. If you still have problems with esophageal stricture after repeat dilations, there are other treatment options your doctor might suggest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27271391\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
