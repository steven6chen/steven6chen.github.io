The only abnormal finding on renal biopsy is diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membranes (GBM) requiring electron microscopy for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Historically, these patients were often described as having benign familial hematuria; however, this terminology is no longer favored.</p><p>TBMN is often familial, with a family history of hematuria being noted in 30 to 50 percent of cases. TBMN seems to account for most cases of what has been called benign familial hematuria. Numerous mutations of the type IV collagen genes COL4A3 and COL4A4 have been identified in patients with TBMN, but such mutations are not present in all families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>TBMN will be discussed in this topic review. Alport syndrome is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies on kidneys used for renal transplantation suggest that the frequency of thin glomerular basement membranes (GBM) in the general population may be as high as 5 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) is clinically diagnosed in less than 1 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It had been suspected that the genetic defect in thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) would be similar to that in hereditary nephritis (Alport syndrome) since patients with the latter group of disorders also have thin glomerular basement membranes (GBM) early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This hypothesis was confirmed in families in which TBMN was associated with heterozygous defects in COL4A3 or COL4A4, the genes that encode the alpha-3 and alpha-4 chains of type IV collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/8,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10-15</a>]. </p><p>Patients with TBMN can be considered &quot;carriers&quot; of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome since mutations in both alleles of COL4A3 or COL4A4 cause autosomal recessive Alport syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Mutations in both alleles can be the same (homozygous) or different (compound heterozygous). Approximately 40 to 50 percent of heterozygous carriers of a COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutation in Alport families exhibit microhematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>Although both alleles of COL4A3 or COL4A4 must be involved to produce autosomal recessive Alport syndrome, TBMN is transmitted in a dominant fashion because the abnormal gene product produces a defect in collagen that is sufficiently severe to interfere with the normal architecture of the GBM, resulting in hematuria. In most cases, however, the heterozygous defect does not provoke the secondary processes that result in the proteinuria, impaired glomerular filtration, and renal fibrosis observed in patients with Alport syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-pathogenesis-and-pathology-of-alport-syndrome-hereditary-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Linkage with the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes has not been found in all families with TBMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. The underlying defect(s) in these other families are not known. Possibilities include de novo mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], incomplete penetrance, or novel genetic loci.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) is often familial, with pedigrees exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It has been proposed that red cells enter Bowman's space in TBMN by moving through localized, transient ruptures in the glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Such ruptures may also account for the small number of red cells excreted in normal urine. </p><p>As in other glomerular diseases, dysmorphic red cells and, in some patients, red blood cell casts can be seen on examination of the urine sediment in patients with TBMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26</a>].

Renal biopsy is generally <strong>not</strong> performed in patients who present with familial isolated glomerular hematuria, no or minimal proteinuria, normal renal function, and no family history of renal failure. The prognosis is excellent in such patients unless the clinical manifestations progress, as occurs in all males and some females with Alport syndrome, as well as many patients with IgA nephropathy.

With X-linked and autosomal recessive Alport syndrome, hearing loss is often observed in childhood, but ocular abnormalities may not be evident until the third decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where available, immunohistology of skin biopsy specimens may be a direct way to distinguish between these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Incubation of the biopsy specimen with a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen (which is the site of the primary abnormality in X-linked Alport syndrome) shows no staining along the epidermal basement membrane in approximately 80 percent of males with X-linked Alport syndrome, discontinuous staining in 60 to 70 percent of females with X-linked Alport syndrome, and normal staining in individuals with TBMN. Since some patients with X-linked Alport syndrome and all patients with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome have normal epidermal basement membrane staining for the alpha-5(IV) chain, this test can confirm a suspected diagnosis of X-linked Alport syndrome, but it cannot by itself exclude the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although renal biopsy may reveal thin GBM as the only abnormality in children and women with Alport syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], incubation of kidney tissue with antibodies against the alpha-3, -4, and -5 chains of type IV collagen reveals abnormalities of renal basement membrane staining in the majority of patients (but shows normal staining in TBMN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/8,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,36</a>].

Such staining is not required, for example, in the patient with isolated hematuria and thin GBM who has a positive family history of hematuria but a negative history for renal failure. By comparison, immunostaining should be considered in sporadic cases (ie, patients who have no relatives with hematuria), in patients with thin GBM and a family history of kidney failure, and in patients with thin GBM and elevated urine protein levels.

It is unclear whether there is a true relationship between these disorders or whether thin GBM might increase the severity of concurrent IgA nephropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No prospective controlled studies have evaluated the efficacy of therapy in patients with thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). Based principally upon benefits observed in patients with proteinuria and other forms of chronic kidney disease, we suggest the administration of an angiotensin II enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker in adults with TBMN who also have<strong> proteinuria (above 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</strong>,</span> particularly if they also have elevated blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevation in serum creatinine or reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Data are not available on the efficacy of such an approach in proteinuric TBMN but, when used, both the proteinuria and blood pressure goals should be the same as those in other forms of proteinuric chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H149378842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Proteinuria goal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure goal'</a>.) </p><p>As noted above, occasional patients have recurrent episodes of gross hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flank pain. The administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may be beneficial in this setting, perhaps by lowering the intraglomerular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, treating hypercalciuria or hyperuricosuria, if present, has reduced hematuria in other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Although thin glomerular basement membranes (GBM) can be seen in 5 to 9 percent of biopsy specimens, it is clinically diagnosed in less than 1 percent of the population. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterozygous defects in COL4A3 or COL4A4, the genes that encode for the alpha-3 and alpha-4 chains of type IV collagen, are responsible for this disorder in 40 to 50 percent of affected families. Patients with these heterozygous mutations can be considered &quot;carriers&quot; of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome since mutations in both alleles of COL4A3 or COL4A4 cause autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of hematuria is noted in 30 to 50 percent of cases, most commonly with autosomal dominant inheritance. The characteristic manifestation of TBMN is persistent or intermittent asymptomatic glomerular hematuria. Most frequently, urinary protein excretion, blood pressure, and renal function are normal. Some patients have minimal to moderate proteinuria (usually less than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day,</span> rarely in the nephrotic range) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension. The invariable finding on renal biopsy with TBMN is diffuse thinning of the GBM on electron microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is usually inferred from the benign presentation and course, the positive family history of hematuria, and the negative family history of renal failure. Renal biopsy is generally <strong>not</strong> performed in such patients. However, we suggest the performance of a renal biopsy in adults with suspected TBMN (eg, glomerular hematuria) <strong>plus</strong> proteinuria (defined as greater than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. TBMN must be distinguished from the other common glomerular causes of isolated hematuria: IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, an excellent long-term prognosis is observed. However, slowly progressive renal insufficiency can occur and is often manifested on renal biopsy by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Follow-up is essential to identify those individuals who exhibit a progressive disease course. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with TBMN <strong>plus</strong> proteinuria (greater than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> we suggest the administration of an angiotensin II enzyme inhibitor therapy or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In such patients, we suggest that both the proteinuria and blood pressure goals should be the same as those in other forms of proteinuric chronic kidney disease. These issues are discussed elsewhere.
