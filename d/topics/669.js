Aluminum toxicity primarily results from exposure to aluminum in dialysis fluid and from the ingestion of aluminum-containing phosphate binders among patients who cannot excrete it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Aluminum toxicity is now uncommon because aluminum is now removed from water used for dialysis and because nonaluminum-containing phosphate binders are widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews aluminum toxicity in CKD patients, particularly in hemodialysis patients, in whom it is still occasionally observed.

Since 2003, the reported frequency of increased aluminum concentrations among hemodialysis patients in the United States was 0.5 to 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, there are clusters of cases of aluminum toxicity among patients dialyzed at a common facility. Such cases are usually due to increases in the aluminum content of the municipal water supply that provides water to the dialysis facility or caused by defects in the <span class=\"nowrap\">water/dialysate</span> fluid purification <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distribution system within individual dialysis units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H108667437\" class=\"local\">'Aluminum in dialysis fluid'</a> below.)</p><p>Aluminum staining may still be observed in bone biopsies of dialysis patients from some countries. In one study, published in 2000, 95 percent of bone biopsies from Uruguay contained aluminum compared with only 19 percent from Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, many of the biopsies were from before 1990, which was when many countries instituted improved purification techniques in dialysis units.</p><p>Reports of aluminum toxicity among nondialysis CKD patients are exceedingly rare. Virtually all reports are of patients who were ingesting aluminum concurrently with citrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Citrate increases the absorption of aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H533965128\" class=\"local\">'Aluminum with citrate'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF ALUMINUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major sources of aluminum exposure include the dialysis fluid and aluminum-containing phosphate binders and antacids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Other medications may also contain small amounts of aluminum that can accumulate in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108667437\"><span class=\"h2\">Aluminum in dialysis fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Municipal water supplies (which supply water to dialysis facilities) contain a relatively high concentration of aluminum. These concentrations are considered safe for the general population but are toxic for hemodialysis patients. This is because hemodialysis patients are exposed to very large volumes of fluid and have no means to excrete the aluminum that is in the fluid.</p><p>The toxicity of aluminum in dialysis water was recognized by 1980 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. This recognition led to the development of effective methods of water purification. In addition, when toxicity was recognized, stringent international and national guidelines were established that recommended the maximal allowable limit of aluminum in dialysate water. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contaminants in water used for hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Water quality requirements'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The contribution of dialysis fluid to aluminum toxicity decreased markedly as a result of improved water purification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The introduction of reverse osmosis for water purification has essentially eliminated the problem of water contamination with aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There are still occasional reports of high serum aluminum concentrations, despite water purification methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Such reports are all related to changes in the aluminum content of the municipal water supply or to defects in the water and dialysate purification and distribution systems within individual dialysis facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. As an example, in 2007, 10 patients with high serum aluminum concentrations were reported from a center in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The high aluminum concentrations resulted from contamination of dialysate acid concentrate by newly installed electric drum pumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In 2001, 27 patients dialyzed on the island of Cura&ccedil;ao were exposed to toxic levels of aluminum resulting from the installation of a distribution pipe that supplied the dialysis facility with water; of these, 10 patients died from acute exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contaminants in water used for hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute encephalopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2004 and 2005, several Canadian peritoneal dialysis centers noted increasing serum aluminum levels during yearly routine monitoring. Investigation eventually documented high aluminum content in dialysates manufactured by Fresenius Canada. However, because the problem was detected rapidly, no clinical consequences were observed in the study cohort. The presence of residual renal function was protective against aluminum accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108667891\"><span class=\"h2\">Aluminum-containing phosphate binders and antacids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aluminum-containing phosphate binders and antacids are a source of aluminum toxicity in CKD patients.</p><p>Both the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines suggest avoiding aluminum-containing binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. Aluminum-containing phosphate binders are now infrequently prescribed across the world but are still being used in Australia and Russia, as well as some other countries. A study from Russia showed that aluminum-containing phosphate binders were used in 17.6 percent of their hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The use of aluminum-containing phosphate binders has declined because nonaluminum-containing phosphate binders are now widely available. However, some patients may still be given aluminum-containing phosphate binders for a brief period of time (one to two weeks). Such patients include those with refractory hyperphosphatemia (which may respond better to aluminum-containing phosphate binders) and those with side effects to nonaluminum-containing phosphate binders (such as hypercalcemia). However, given that the amount of aluminum intake required to cause toxicity is not known, there is no &quot;safe&quot; dose of aluminum-containing phosphate binder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There are still occasional reports of high aluminum concentrations that are presumed to be due to phosphate binders. As an example, in one report, among 136 hemodialysis patients (many who reported use of aluminum-containing phosphate binders), 16 percent had serum aluminum levels greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> and, in three cases, aluminum levels were higher than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Aluminum levels greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> are considered abnormal. The elevated aluminum concentrations were believed to be primarily due to the use of aluminum-containing binders because the dialysis water was shown to be within the maximum allowable limit for aluminum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533965128\"><span class=\"h2\">Aluminum with citrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Citrate is a major factor in the toxicity of orally administrated aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>]. Aluminum toxicity may occur in CKD patients who are given aluminum-containing phosphate binders plus sodium citrate. Citrate markedly enhances intestinal aluminum absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55777\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55777 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25,26</a>]. The mechanism by which this occurs is believed to be both by keeping aluminum soluble (via the formation of aluminum citrate) and by chelating calcium in the intestinal lumen (which increases permeability of intestinal wall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric citrate</a> as a phosphate binder raised concern about enhanced aluminum absorption from drinking water, food, and drugs. However, one randomized control trial found no significant differences in serum aluminum levels between the ferric citrate-treated group and active control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Among 185 participants in the ferric citrate group with available serum aluminum measurements, the median aluminum level was 6.0 (range, 5 to 24) <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> at baseline and 7.0 (5 to 23) <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> at the end of the 52-week active control period. These values were not significantly different from levels in the active control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108667938\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other sources of aluminum include oral and injectable medications that are commonly administered to dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Iron and calcium-containing medications have the highest aluminum levels, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> and vitamins B complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one analysis, acetylsalicylic acid, calcitriol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, vitamins, iron sulfate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> all contained between 85 and &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Most preparations tested in this study had much lower aluminum concentrations. Injectable drugs have much greater contamination than oral formulations. Among the medications investigated, injectables such as iron, erythropoietin, and insulin were found to be the most significant source of aluminum for hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533968227\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine monitoring of serum aluminum levels can identify excessive aluminum exposure in individual patients or detect accidental contamination of dialysate with aluminum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>However, given the low prevalence of aluminum toxicity among hemodialysis patients, we do not routinely measure serum aluminum levels in all hemodialysis patients. We believe that routine screening is not cost effective in most patients in the United States. This practice differs from the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, which recommend serum aluminum testing at least annually in all hemodialysis patients and every three months in those who receive aluminum-containing medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aluminum-toxicity-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

We screen for aluminum toxicity by measuring the unstimulated serum aluminum concentration (ie, the concentration in the absence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a>). Patients who are identified by screening to have serum aluminum concentration &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> should be evaluated further for aluminum toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H533968709\" class=\"local\">'Chronic toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who are undergoing parathyroid surgery for CKD-related secondary hyperparathyroidism and who also have a history of aluminum exposure should be screened prior to surgery with an unstimulated serum aluminum concentration.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sources of aluminum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We selectively monitor at-risk patients with serum aluminum levels:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In locations where water purification systems may be inadequate or aluminum-based phosphate binders are still prescribed, we suggest measuring serum aluminum every four to six months. Patients who have serum aluminum concentration &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> should be evaluated further for aluminum toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H533968227\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are undergoing parathyroid surgery for CKD-related secondary hyperparathyroidism and who have a history of aluminum exposure should undergo screening with an unstimulated serum aluminum concentration. If the unstimulated concentration is &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> such patients should have further testing with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> stimulation test. (See <a href=\"#H533968227\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of chronic aluminum toxicity include bone and muscle pain, weakness, osteomalacia, iron-resistant microcytic anemia, hypercalcemia, and slowly progressive dementia. This can occur in the setting of aluminum levels that are 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> or greater.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The major clinical manifestation of acute aluminum toxicity is encephalopathy, which can be fatal. Increased serum levels of aluminum of 400 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> are typically observed. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of aluminum toxicity is based upon the baseline (ie, unstimulated) serum aluminum concentration and followed by, in selected patients, a deferoxamine-stimulated serum aluminum level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96380\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96380 \">algorithm 1</a>). To test with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a>, we administer deferoxamine at a dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> one hour prior to the end of the dialysis session. The serum aluminum is measured prior to and two days after the deferoxamine infusion (before the next dialysis session). The test is considered positive if there is an increase in serum aluminum of &ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with serum aluminum levels &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> should <strong>not</strong> undergo a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> stimulation test, because the administration of deferoxamine may cause severe, and occasionally fatal, neurotoxicity when it is administered to patients with very high unstimulated serum aluminum concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H533968709\" class=\"local\">'Chronic toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to treatment is consistent with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines and is summarized in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96111 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F96112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96112 \">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All patients with increased serum aluminum (ie, &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> should be assessed for sources of aluminum exposure. Aluminum-containing phosphate binders and all other medications that may contain even small amounts of aluminum should be discontinued, if possible. (See <a href=\"#H533968916\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All symptomatic patients who have unstimulated serum aluminum 20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> should undergo <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> stimulation testing to determine the optimal treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a deferoxamine-stimulated aluminum concentration increase of 50 to 299 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

The risk of deferoxamine toxicity outweighs any known benefit. Such patients are assessed for sources of aluminum exposure, including prescription and nonprescription medications.
