Diuretics reduce urate excretion by both directly and indirectly increasing urate reabsorption and decreasing urate secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/2,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-9</a>]; the effect is dose dependent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69912\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69912 \">figure 1</a>).

Urate enters the proximal tubular cell from peritubular capillary blood through organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3) located on the basolateral membrane, and is secreted from the cell into the tubular fluid through solute carrier (SLC) family members SLC17A1 and SLC17A3, multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), and ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) located on the luminal membrane. Urate reabsorption from the tubular fluid into the cell is mediated by urate transporter 1 (URAT1), OAT4, and OAT10, located on the luminal membrane, and from the cell back to the peritubular capillary blood through glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) located on the basolateral membrane.</p><p>Loop and thiazide diuretics decrease urate excretion by increasing net urate reabsorption; this can occur either by enhanced reabsorption or by reduced secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Two mechanisms have been proposed as contributing to diuretic-induced hyperuricemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A direct effect of diuretics on promoting urate reabsorption by the proximal tubule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An indirect effect of diuretic-induced volume depletion on increasing urate reabsorption by the proximal tubule</p><p/><p>The degree of urate retention caused by diuretics is dose dependent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F69912\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69912 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This contrasts with the dose response relationship between diuretics and blood pressure, in which 12.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> (or its equivalent) is often as effective as 50 mg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61248 \">figure 4</a>).

First, the thiazide enters the proximal tubule cell from the peritubular capillary blood through the anion exchanger, OAT1, on the basolateral membrane. The diuretic is then released into the tubular fluid from the cell by the urate anion exchanger, OAT4, on the luminal membrane, driving reabsorption of urate. Thiazide diuretics also upregulate the sodium-hydrogen exchanger in the proximal tubule, thereby stimulating pH-dependent OAT4 activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, both thiazide and loop diuretics may inhibit MRP4 on the luminal membrane, reducing secretion of urate into the tubular fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532634\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect effect of diuretic-induced volume depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume depletion appears to play an important role in diuretic-induced hyperuricemia since urate retention does not occur if the diuretic-induced fluid losses are replaced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, short- and long-term salt restriction produces significant hyperuricemia, which is reversed by salt loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. In various studies, the difference in serum uric acid between salt restricted and salt loaded subjects was 1 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p>How volume depletion or salt restriction increases net urate reabsorption is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One possible explanation is the parallel relationship between sodium and urate reabsorption in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. Urate entry into the cell appears to occur by a variety of anion exchangers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83926\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83926 \">figure 3</a>), including urate-hydroxyl and urate-lactate exchangers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Both of these processes are dependent upon sodium transport.</p><p>As an example, sodium-hydrogen exchangers in the luminal membrane are responsible for most of proximal bicarbonate reabsorption. The secretion of hydrogen ions by these transporters makes the cell more alkaline than the tubular lumen. The higher hydroxyl concentration in the cell provides a favorable gradient for hydroxyl exit, which can then drive urate reabsorption. Similarly, sodium-lactate cotransporters in the luminal membrane mediate lactate entry into the cell; this lactate can then be secreted back into the lumen by urate-lactate exchange.</p><p>This indirect relationship between sodium and urate is clinically important because hypovolemia (in part via increased generation of angiotensin II) is associated with an appropriate increase in proximal sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The rise in the activity of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] can then lead to increased urate-hydroxyl exchange and therefore enhanced urate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532422\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thiazide diuretics are widely used in treatment of hypertension and are inexpensive and efficacious.

In a large prospective cohort of men, for example, approximately 4700 participants without a prior history of gout used diuretics and nearly 3 percent of these men subsequently developed gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Compared with men who did not use diuretics, those who did had a 77 percent higher relative risk of developing gout, even after controlling for conventional risk factors for gout such as adiposity, alcohol intake, kidney function, and hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT AND BENEFITS OF ANGIOTENSIN INHIBITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of diuretic-induced asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not necessary, even though the plasma urate concentration may exceed 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (893 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> with diuretic therapy (particularly in patients with reduced renal perfusion due to underlying advanced heart failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/1,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31</a>]. These patients are not at risk of uric acid precipitation in the tubules (uric acid nephropathy), since the elevation in the plasma urate level is due to an initial decrease in the rate of urate excretion. Prophylactic therapy with a potentially toxic drug (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>) is not warranted to prevent a benign complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of gout is <strong>not</strong> necessarily an indication for discontinuation of the diuretic, particularly if diuretic therapy is required for management of edema. However, if blood pressure control can be effectively and affordably achieved with an appropriate alternative agent, such as an angiotensin inhibitor or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, then the diuretic can be stopped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with diuretic-induced gout are treated with a urate-lowering drug such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;</a>). The concomitant use of a urate-lowering agent and a diuretic may require a higher dose of the former to achieve the goal range for serum urate of &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. This combination was originally thought to impart a higher risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, subsequent studies suggest that carefully titrating the urate-lowering drug dose to achieve the goal urate level is likely <strong>not</strong> associated with a higher risk for this serious adverse event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>We agree with the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for treatment of the hyperuricemia of patients with gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> dose titration should begin at 100 mg daily (or 50 mg daily in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease); the dose should be titrated in increments of 100 mg (or 50 mg) every two to four weeks until the goal serum urate is achieved (&lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span>. Gout flares are common in the early months of urate-lowering therapy, and flare prophylaxis, generally with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, is recommended as cotherapy with allopurinol.
