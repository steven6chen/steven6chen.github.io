In most healthy adults, GBS is harmless. But in pregnant women and their babies, a GBS infection can be serious.</p><p>This article is about GBS infection in pregnant women and their babies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25198155\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of GBS infection in pregnant women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBS infection often causes no symptoms. When it does cause symptoms, the symptoms depend on the organs involved. Common types of GBS infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder infection &ndash; The symptoms of a bladder infection include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain or a burning feeling when you urinate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The need to urinate often</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The need to urinate suddenly or in a hurry</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood in the urine </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney infection &ndash; The symptoms of a kidney infection can include the symptoms of a bladder infection, but they can also include fever, back pain, and nausea and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotic infection (also called intraamniotic infection) &ndash; The symptoms of an amniotic infection include</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tenderness in the lower part of the belly, where the uterus is found</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A fast heart rate in the mother or the fetus (unborn baby)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25198170\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for GBS infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can take samples of different body fluids and then check whether any GBS bacteria grow in those samples over time. This is called doing a &quot;culture.&quot;</p><p>Most doctors recommend that all women have a urine culture for GBS early in pregnancy. Expert groups also recommend that all pregnant women have GBS cultures done on samples from the vagina and rectum at 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy. Women who test positive for GBS can take antibiotics to treat the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25198185\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you are pregnant and have any signs of infection, such as the symptoms listed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25198200\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can GBS cause to a mother or her baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the mother, GBS can cause infections of the amniotic fluid or uterus, and early delivery (called preterm birth). In newborns, GBS can cause serious infections in the lungs, blood, brain and spinal cord, bones and joints, and skin and soft tissues (such as muscle or fat).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25198215\"><span class=\"h1\">How is GBS disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for pregnant women involves getting an antibiotic into a vein (IV) during labor. This protects the mother and her baby from having problems caused by GBS.</p><p>If you are treated for GBS during labor, you and the baby's health care team should watch the baby for signs of infection after he or she is born. In a baby, the signs of infection include fever or low temperature, poor feeding, trouble breathing, being irritable, and being very sleepy.</p><p>If your baby's doctor thinks your baby has an infection, he or she might order blood tests, X-rays, or other tests. Babies who develop GBS infection are treated with antibiotics through an IV for at least 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25198230\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccination during pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
