A GWAS study minimized heterogeneity by examining only Chinese women (n &gt;5000) with recurrent episodes of major depression and no substance use disorders prior to onset of the disorder, and comparing them with controls (n &gt;5000) who had no personal or family psychiatric history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Two loci on chromosome 10 were associated with major depression, and the findings were replicated in a separate sample of Chinese cases and controls. Nevertheless, the genetic variants do not appear to be associated with the disease in European samples. &#160; </p><p>Several studies have focused on the interaction between genes and environmental factors in developing depression, but the findings have not been consistently replicated. A study found that polymorphisms in the corticotropin-releasing hormone type 1 receptor gene appeared to reduce the risk of depression in adults with a history abuse during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

As a second example, several studies reported that an interaction between the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene and stressful life events increased the risk for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of 14 studies (n &gt;14,000 participants) found that the serotonin transporter genotype did not add anything to the prediction of increased risk of depression associated with stressful life events and thus failed to confirm this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Different studies suggest that many of the genes putatively involved in the pathogenesis of unipolar major depression may also confer risk for other types of psychopathology: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of five case-control cohorts found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2251219) on chromosome 3 was present in more patients with either unipolar major depression or bipolar disorder than healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In addition, epigenetic changes may involve heritable modifications of the genome that change gene expression without altering any DNA sequence. Evidence that implicates epigenetic factors in the pathophysiology of depression includes a study that examined 12 twins (6 monozygotic pairs) who were discordant for a lifetime history of an anxiety or depressive disorder; most of the largest methylation differences between the twins were found in genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacogenetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic factors in patients with unipolar depression may influence response to antidepressants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of five studies (n = 544 Caucasian patients) reported that polymorphisms related to expression of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR, located on chromosome 17) were significantly associated with remission of depression in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent meta-analysis found that besides 5-HTTLPR, two genes located on chromosome 11 were significantly associated with efficacy of antidepressant treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Patients in remission from major depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors often exhibit a severe, rapid relapse after acute tryptophan depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/142,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,143</a>]. In addition, a meta-analysis of nine observational studies showed that serum concentrations of tryptophan were significantly lower in unmedicated patients with major depression (n = 156) than controls (n = 203), and the clinical difference was large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. </p><p>The role of catecholamine system (norepinephrine and dopamine) has also been examined using a depletion paradigm with alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, which rapidly depletes catecholamines by inhibiting their synthesis.

These studies support the hypothesis that some patients have a subtype of depression that is dopamine-sensitive and resistant to treatment with antidepressants that act initially on the serotonin and norepinephrine pathways.</p><p>Numerous studies implicate changes in GABA and glutamate in the pathophysiology of depression. A magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocol observed elevated levels of glutamate and lower levels of GABA in the occipital cortex of subjects diagnosed with major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].

These findings suggest that the changes in glutamate and GABA may vary by brain region. A gene expression study in the cingulate and prefrontal cortex of depressed suicides found significant alterations in glutamate recycling (glutamine synthase and GLUL), glutamate receptors (GRIA1, GRIA3, GRIK1, GRM3), and GABA receptors (GABARB3, GABRD, GABARG2) in depressed suicides versus controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-neurobiology/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>].</p><p>Glutamate antagonists may thus be beneficial in treating major depression.

Across 14 countries, the estimated lifetime prevalence of unipolar major depression and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) in adults is 12 percent. Among United States adults, the lifetime prevalence of unipolar major depression is approximately 17 percent. The 12-month prevalence of major depression in the United States among females and males is 8 and 4 percent. Major depression is less common in older than younger adults. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of major depression appears to involve three broad sets of risk factors, including internalizing factors (eg, genetics and neuroticism), externalizing factors (eg, genetics and substance misuse), and adversity (eg, trauma and parental loss). Social factors and psychologic factors may also contribute to the etiology of depression. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genes probably contribute vulnerability toward depression that requires additional non-genetic factors to produce the disorder. The concordance rate for major depression in monozygotic twins is about 37 percent. Multiple genetic studies have not yielded robust, replicable findings identifying specific genes linked to risk of developing major depression. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression can occur secondary to many general medical illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Secondary depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression is associated with many neurobiologic changes; however, it is not clear if these changes represent etiologic causes, sequelae, both, or neither. Depression is associated with changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neural networks, the frontal cortex and subcortical structures (anatomic changes), the number and density of neurons (cellular alterations), brain activity, circadian rhythms, inflammatory processes, length of telomeres, and functioning of neurotransmitters. As an example, the hippocampus is smaller in patients with depression. Multiple studies suggest that this reduced volume precedes the onset of depression in at least some patients.
