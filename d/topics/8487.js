In one study that used clinician coding of eosinophilia to identify patients with HES in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the estimated prevalence was between 0.36 to 6.3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although HES (including myeloid variants) can develop in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. When HES is suspected in a child, a careful evaluation for clonal abnormalities should be performed, as preliminary evidence suggests that these may be found in a higher percentage of children compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain variants of HES (ie, those associated with aberrations in the gene for tyrosine kinase receptor platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha [<em>PDGFRA</em>] and platelet-derived growth factor beta [<em>PDGFRB</em>]) occur almost exclusively in males, whereas others (lymphocytic variant HES [L-HES] and HES of unknown etiology) appear to be equally distributed between the sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Common target organs include the skin, lung, and gastrointestinal tract. Less commonly, patients can have potentially life-threatening damage to the cardiovascular system and brain. Activated eosinophils may damage tissues in a number of mechanisms, which are described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophil-biology-and-causes-of-eosinophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophil biology and causes of eosinophilia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Eosinophils are derived from myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow, through the action of three hematopoietic cytokines: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interleukin-5 (IL-5). Of these three, only IL-5 is specific for eosinophil differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of eosinophil overproduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that at least two distinct mechanisms can lead to dysregulated overproduction of eosinophils in patients with HES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clonal eosinophilic proliferation as a result of a primary molecular defect involving hematopoietic stem cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> defects in signal transduction from the receptors that mediate eosinophilopoiesis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overproduction of eosinophilopoietic cytokines, such as IL-5</p><p/><p>In theory, HES could also result from defects in the normal suppressive regulation of eosinophil survival and activation, abnormalities in chemotaxis, or from functional abnormalities of the eosinophilopoietic cytokines, related to enhanced or prolonged biologic activity. However, these mechanisms have not been conclusively demonstrated.</p><p>Since the initial description of HES, progress has been made in identifying specific etiologic abnormalities that underlie hypereosinophilia (HE) in some patients with an HES occurring in the absence of an obvious cause (such as parasitic infection or drug allergy). These involve both of the above mentioned mechanisms: clonal eosinophil production (eg most significantly Fip1-like1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha [FIP1LI-PDGFRA]) and reactive IL-5-driven eosinophil expansion (eg lymphocytic variant HES [L-HES]). In practice, once classical causes of HE have been ruled out (parasitic infection, etc), the underlying mechanism resulting in HE remains unknown despite thorough investigations in 70 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12-15</a>]. However, the true proportion of all patients with unexplained HE and identified abnormalities remains unknown, since the techniques used for identification have not been uniformly applied across series. Moreover, it is probable that each of the major investigative groups is affected by referral biases favoring HES patients with certain clinical presentations. Thus, while a specific center may observe a particular etiology to be common in its own patients with HES, this does not provide much information about prevalence in the broader population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HES variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HES has been subdivided into several clinically relevant variants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59869 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myeloid variants of HES (M-HES).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T lymphocytic variants of HES (L-HES).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial HES.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic HES (IHES).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ-restricted hypereosinophilic conditions &ndash; This term is applied to disorders with blood eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1500/microliter</span> in the setting of single organ involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Specific/defined</span> syndromes associated with HE &mdash; This term is applied to disorders with blood eosinophilia <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1500/microliter</span> in association with a distinct diagnosis, wherein the role of eosinophils in disease complications and clinical manifestations remains inconclusive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Myeloid HES variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subgroup of patients with HES display features more typical of myeloproliferative disorders, including increased serum vitamin B12 levels, chromosomal abnormalities, anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and circulating leukocyte precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,18</a>].

Symptoms generally appear at intervals of three to four weeks and resolve spontaneously within several days. A diuresis may occur with resolution. Based on the approximately 50 cases that have been reported, patients are typically between 10 and 34 years of age when symptoms initially develop. The contribution of eosinophils to clinical manifestations remains uncertain, although increased deposition of eosinophil granule protein in angioedematous skin has been noted. In a subset of patients with Gleich syndrome, a clonally expanded CD3-CD4+ T cell population is present.

Such patients can be classified as L-HES on a pathogenic basis.

The authors prefer to view EGPA as an organ-restricted eosinophilic disorder, since it is a disease of one organ (blood vessels), although clinical manifestations can involve the sinuses, lungs, skin, heart, peripheral nerves, and other structures. However, other experts believe it is more appropriately classified as a defined syndrome associated with HE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59869 \">table 1</a>). This issue remains an area of debate.</p><p>In some patients presenting with HE and pulmonary disease, determining if eosinophilia and organ involvement represents chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (organ-restricted), IHES, or EGPA can be difficult clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Many patients meet diagnostic criteria for both disorders. This is particularly challenging in the early stages of EGPA before the development of vasculitis and in patients who are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-negative. Moreover, both disorders usually respond initially to glucocorticoids, and while glucocorticoid therapy is beneficial, it may further impede the clinician's ability to distinguish between these two conditions. Therefore, histologic assessment for vasculitis is recommended when symptoms suggest small- and medium-sized blood vessel damage, as therapeutic strategies to treat end-organ injury differ, especially for the choice of second-line agents. Early in disease, pathology usually reveals eosinophil tissue infiltration without the distinguishing granulomas and frank vasculitis of late-stage EGPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

The disease is usually clinically silent at this phase. Physical examination generally is normal, although conjunctival <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subungual splinter hemorrhages (which probably represent small emboli from the endocardial surface) are sometimes noted. Elevations in serum troponin levels can be sensitive indicators of early and ongoing eosinophil-associated myocardial damage in forms of HES and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>].</p><p>Echocardiography can be normal during the acute necrotic stage.

Endomyocardial biopsy may provide definitive evidence of eosinophil-associated cardiac involvement, but is typically reserved for patients in whom there is uncertainty whether infiltrating eosinophils are causing cardiac disease. Staining of biopsy specimens with antibodies for eosinophil granule proteins, including major basic protein 1 (MBP1), can demonstrate eosinophil-related tissue damage even in the absence of significant eosinophil accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>The second stage of heart disease involves thrombus formation along areas of damaged endocardium. The thrombogenic sequelae of eosinophilic tissue infiltration may arise from the actions of eosinophil peroxidase in forming hypothiocyanous acid, a compound which diffuses into endothelial cells and strongly induces tissue factor expression by these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

The major complication of intracardiac thrombus formation is the detachment and distant embolization of thrombotic material, leading to embolic strokes, ischemia of extremities, and other embolic events.

Evaluation may demonstrate mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, cardiomegaly, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or T wave inversions on the electrocardiogram. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI can show intracardiac thrombi or evidence of fibrosis, such as thickening of the posterior mitral valve leaflet or the posterior wall, late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI, and increases in endomyocardial echodensity in areas of fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82429\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82429 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypereosinophilic-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H19581596\" class=\"local\">'Hypereosinophilic syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the exception of common underlying causes of HE that can occur at any age (parasitic infection, drug allergy, neoplastic disease), the HES are most common in patients 20 to 50 years of age. The Fip1-like1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<em>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</em>)-associated variant affects mostly males, whereas other variants appear to affect males and females in roughly equal proportions. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs and symptoms of HES result from overproduction of eosinophils, which infiltrate and damage various tissues. HE may result from clonal eosinophilic proliferation or from overproduction of eosinophilopoietic cytokines, such as interleukin 5 (IL-5). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important clinically relevant subtypes include myeloid variants, T cell lymphocytic variants, and familial eosinophilia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59869 \">table 1</a>). These subtypes are associated with a more clearly defined clinical presentation and prognosis, and, in the case of the <em>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</em>-associated myeloproliferative variant, response to specific therapies. Underlying molecular or immunologic defects can be identified in 20 to 30 percent of cases. Other complex forms of HES have still uncertain etiologies, justifying their classification as &quot;idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome&quot; (IHES). These represent the bulk of subjects with HES and may be difficult to distinguish from other eosinophil-associated disorders, including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'HES variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance (HE<sub>US</sub>) describes patients with persistent unexplained HE, but without apparent complications related to tissue eosinophilia. This terminology highlights both the lack of an explanation for HE and the inability to predict whether the patient will eventually develop clinical manifestations related to eosinophilic organ infiltration, and thus progress to HES. (See <a href=\"#H521099149\" class=\"local\">'Hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organ systems most commonly affected in HES are the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and nervous system. In many patients, the onset of symptoms is insidious and eosinophilia may even be detected incidentally. In a minority, the initial manifestations are severe and life-threatening due to the rapid evolution of cardiovascular or neurologic complications. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HES should be considered in patients with sustained blood eosinophilia of &gt;1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> documented on at least two occasions, or evidence of tissue HE. Once secondary causes of eosinophilia that require therapy directed at the underlying cause are excluded (eg, helminth infection, drug hypersensitivity, and neoplastic disease), patients with persistent eosinophilia should be evaluated accordingly, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms. This evaluation involves an assessment of end-organ involvement as well as specialized studies to identify patients with myeloid or clonal lymphocytic variants.
