Specific methods include periprocedural sedation, painless wound-handling techniques (eg, Steri-Strip closure, use of paraffin gauze, avoidance of adhesive tapes), and postoperative pain management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of hypotension, hypovolemia, hyperthermia, and hypocarbia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].

Some experts keep blood pressure slightly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, blood pressure lowering may be helpful to prevent symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after revascularization surgery.

The use of thrombolytic therapy or antithrombotic agents during the acute phase of ischemic stroke associated with moyamoya disease has not been studied in any systematic way. Because of the risk of hemorrhage in areas of extensive moyamoya collateral vessels, many experts are reluctant to use thrombolytic therapy to treat acute ischemic stroke in patients with moyamoya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> over no treatment as initial therapy for children with acute arterial ischemic stroke secondary to moyamoya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The general approach to the evaluation and management of acute ischemic stroke is reviewed in detail separately.

Secondary prevention for patients with symptomatic moyamoya is largely centered on surgical revascularization techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In patients with moyamoya syndrome, it is also important to search for and treat the underlying condition. The main example is sickle cell disease, where transfusion therapy is effective in primary and secondary stroke prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute stroke in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antiplatelet agents, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, have been used to treat some patients with moyamoya disease or moyamoya syndrome, particularly those who are asymptomatic or have mildly symptomatic ischemic disease, or those considered to have a high risk for poor surgical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, some centers use aspirin for all patients after surgical revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, evidence of benefit with antiplatelets in these settings is limited and equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Oral anticoagulants are seldom used in children with ischemic moyamoya disease because of the risk of hemorrhage after incidental trauma and because of the difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In adults, hemorrhage is the predominant manifestation of moyamoya, and anticoagulation is generally not indicated.</p><p>Calcium channel blockers have also been used to treat patients with moyamoya, but only anecdotal evidence is available concerning their effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Endovascular embolization has been evaluated in small uncontrolled studies to obliterate ruptured intracranial aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms associated with moyamoya disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Revascularization surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgical treatment for moyamoya disease is to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke by improving the cerebral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, surgical procedures are used most often for patients with ischemic-type moyamoya who have cognitive decline or progressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Surgical techniques can be divided into direct and indirect revascularization procedures and their combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct revascularization is used by many centers, and it is thought to improve the angiographic and cerebral blood flow abnormalities, as well as the prognosis associated with moyamoya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass or middle meningeal artery to MCA bypass are the most common direct techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Direct methods are technically difficult to perform in children because of the small size of donor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recipient vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect revascularization is preferred at other centers, particularly in cases where the cortical recipient artery is not available for anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5,16,19,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,19,22,23</a>]. The technique aims to promote the development of a new vascular network over time. In general, indirect revascularization requires less operation time and has lower procedure-related complications than direct revascularization. Indirect techniques include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis and a modification called pial synangiosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Encephalomyosynangiosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Encephaloarteriosynangiosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Encephalodurogaleosynangiosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Omentum transplantation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Craniotomy with inversion of the dura</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple burr holes without vessel synangiosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cervical sympathectomy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined revascularization involves direct revascularization (to immediately augment cerebral blood flow) plus indirect revascularization (to promote improved flow over time) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7496132\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the evidence supporting the effectiveness of surgical treatment for moyamoya comes from retrospective case series and case reports, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review published in 2005 identified 55 studies with data for 1156 children (mainly from Japan) who had surgical revascularization for moyamoya disease or moyamoya syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most patients were treated with indirect surgical techniques or a combination of direct and indirect methods (73 and 23 percent, respectively). Over a mean postoperative follow-up of 58 months, the following observations were reported:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptomatic benefit, defined as complete disappearance or reduction in symptomatic cerebral ischemia, was reported in 1003 children (87 percent).

Among 126 patients followed for more than one year, late-onset stroke occurred in four (3 percent). In 46 patients who presented with stroke and were followed for more than five years, late-onset stroke occurred in two (4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 82 Chinese patients with late Suzuki stage moyamoya disease, the incidence of perioperative stroke with direct bypass surgery was 7 percent. Over a mean follow-up of 55 months, direct bypass surgery was associated with improved cerebral perfusion but no reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke when compared with conservative treatment (10 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>There are no controlled studies directly comparing medical and surgical therapy for ischemic moyamoya disease, and indirect evidence is equivocal. In a large survey study from Japan, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome between patients with moyamoya disease treated with revascularization surgery or medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, in another large survey study from Japan, children with moyamoya who were initially managed nonoperatively developed progressive symptoms that prompted surgery in 38 percent, a rate much higher than the rate of reoperation in children initially managed with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The use of surgery for hemorrhagic moyamoya has been controversial because of concern that revascularization might increase the risk of recurrent hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. However, the available data suggest that revascularization surgery reduces the risk of recurrent hemorrhage, at least for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Japan Adult Moyamoya (JAM) trial evaluated 88 patients who presented with intracranial hemorrhage and randomly assigned them to bilateral direct extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery or to conservative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At five years of follow-up, patients in the surgery group had fewer events for the combined end point of recurrent bleeding or stroke (14 percent, versus 34 percent for conservative care, hazard ratio 0.39, 95% CI 0.15-1.03), a finding that just missed statistical significance. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference between the surgery and conservative groups for the annual event rate of recurrent bleeding or stroke (8.2 versus 3.2 percent) just achieved statistical significance (p = 0.48).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective observational study of 196 patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya treated at a single institution in China over a 25 year period, 92 were lost to follow-up; among the remainder, surgical revascularization was associated with a significantly reduced risk of rebleeding compared with conservative treatment (3 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the strength of this finding is limited by a number of methodologic issues including the nonrandomized design, unclear criteria for surgical treatment, and high loss to follow-up.</p><p/><p>Limited evidence suggests that revascularization surgery is more effective in children than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], especially in children who present with ischemic symptoms. Early surgery for young patients with moyamoya seems warranted based on the evidence that younger age at presentation is associated with increased rates of infarction and a worse prognosis, especially for children younger than three to six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is uncommon though well-described following internal carotid artery revascularization procedures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-carotid-endarterectomy#H101624751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of carotid endarterectomy&quot;, section on 'Hyperperfusion syndrome'</a>). The mechanism is related to changes in cerebral autoregulation induced by chronic cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency, leading to compensatory vasodilation of cerebral vessels. After revascularization, blood flow is restored to a normal or elevated perfusion pressure within the previously hypoperfused hemisphere. The chronically dilated cerebral vessels are unable to vasoconstrict quickly enough to protect the capillary bed because of impaired cerebral blood flow autoregulation. Breakthrough perfusion pressure then causes the clinical manifestations that may include headache, seizures, reversible focal neurologic deficits, cerebral edema, and rarely intracerebral hemorrhage.</p><p>The reported incidence of clinically symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome following bypass surgery for moyamoya disease ranges from 15 to 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. The incidence in children appears to be lower than that in adults. In nearly all cases, complete resolution occurs over several days to weeks. However, some patients with hyperperfusion syndrome, mainly those with intracerebral hemorrhage, can have persistent neurological deficits. Prophylactic postoperative blood pressure lowering may prevent or ameliorate symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative cerebral angiography with bilateral injections of the internal and external carotid arteries and vertebral arteries is generally recommended to evaluate the sites of occlusion and collateral circulation and to identify donor vessels.

Oral anticoagulants are seldom used in children with ischemic moyamoya disease because of the risk of hemorrhage and because of the difficulty maintaining therapeutic levels. In adults, hemorrhage is the predominant manifestation of moyamoya, and anticoagulation is generally not indicated. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children and adults with asymptomatic or symptomatic ischemic moyamoya disease or moyamoya syndrome, we suggest long-term therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> rather than no medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This suggestion also applies to patients who undergo surgical revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with moyamoya disease or moyamoya syndrome who have the following indications, we suggest surgical revascularization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Children and adults with symptoms related to cerebral ischemia, including transient ischemic attack, cognitive decline, or ischemic stroke (see <a href=\"#H7496132\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of surgery'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Asymptomatic children with decreased regional cerebral blood flow or inadequate perfusion reserve as measured by cerebral blood flow studies (see <a href=\"#H7496132\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of surgery'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are no convincing data that one method of revascularization surgery is more effective than another. However, indirect revascularization techniques are generally preferred in younger children. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Revascularization surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children and adults with moyamoya disease or syndrome, we recommend <strong>not</strong> treating with long-term anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of moyamoya disease tends to be progressive. Untreated patients often suffer cognitive and neurologic decline due to repeated ischemic stroke or hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H7496403\" class=\"local\">'Natural history and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/moyamoya-disease-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fukui M.
