Conventional pharmacologic therapy for OA has mainly targeted symptomatic relief, with agents such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, opioid analgesia, and intraarticular injections.</p><p>As we gain a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms in OA, there has been a growing interest in the development of drugs whose mechanism of action are directed towards different pain pathways, as well as the inhibition of catabolic processes or stimulation of anabolic processes in the OA joint. These drugs are referred to as disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) or structure-modifying OA drugs (SMOADs).</p><p>To date, no pharmacologic agents have been approved of by regulatory authorities for disease modification in OA. Existing trial strategies have failed to detect clinical efficacy of potential disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) based on the lack of responsive outcome measures to record treatment-related improvements in pain, function, or joint structure, or just due to lack of efficacy of these agents. While there has been progress with potential new analgesics, including targeting nerve growth factor, the availability of a potential structural modification agent appears distant.</p><p>A review of investigational approaches to the pharmacotherapy of OA will be discussed here. Established therapies for OA and surgical interventions are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-therapy-of-knee-and-hip-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical therapy of knee and hip osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2917427771\"><span class=\"h1\">TARGETS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major goals of osteoarthritis (OA) management are pain control, functional improvement, education about the disease, self-management, and prevention or slowing of structural changes to the joints. However, developing agents to address these goals are challenging given the complexity of pain pathways and the etiology of structural changes.</p><p>As is discussed elsewhere, the etiology of OA is multifactorial and affects the composition and structure of all tissues of the joints, including articular cartilage, bone, ligaments, synovium, and synovial fluid. In addition, there is a poor correlation between symptoms and structural changes, as is often demonstrated on plain radiographic imaging, reinforcing the concept that the pain experienced in OA is likely due to a combination of inflammatory, neuropathic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nociceptive pain. It is also likely that there are multiple local structural sources of pain including subchondral bone marrow lesions, bone, soft tissue around the joint, and bursae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the drug development process, the application of preclinical models of OA to human models has been filled with challenges. Due to difficulties in demonstrating clinical efficacy, many potentially promising disease-modifying OA drug (DMOAD) trials have been terminated. Some of the major categories of investigational agents for the treatment of OA are presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3207431686\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigational agents targeting pain in OA have focused on inhibiting nerve growth factor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1700195099\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhibition of nerve growth factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence supporting the role of nerve growth factor in the development of sensory neurons such as nociceptors, which are involved in sensing tissue damage. Expression of nerve growth factor is increased in injured or inflamed tissue and is associated with increased pain.</p><p>Tanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks nerve growth factor, was shown to significantly reduce knee pain while walking compared with placebo in a randomized trial including 450 patients with moderate to severe knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, trials of tanezumab were put on partial clinical hold by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 due to secondary osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, based on review of clinical information, it was concluded that only 2 of 87 suspected cases were felt to be secondary to osteonecrosis. A subsequent study also found that despite initial reports, tanezumab was not associated with an increase in osteonecrosis but rather rapidly progressive OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There were additional concerns regarding peripheral nervous system effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In 2015, based on favorable reviews of nonclinical data by the FDA, phase III trials resumed. Tanezumab (alongside other drugs that block nerve growth factor) shows promise in OA pain management and is also under review with other pain conditions including bony metastases pain and chronic back pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3590246374\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs targeting structural changes in OA include agents that modify inflammatory pathways, cartilage catabolism and anabolism, and bone remodeling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2868249826\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammatory pathways</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3562501152\"><span class=\"h4\">Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, predominantly produced by activated synoviocytes, phagocytic mononuclear cells, and articular cartilage, is one of the major cytokines involved in the destruction of articular matrix. Together with interleukin (IL)-1beta, it activates inflammatory signaling pathways that end in the activation of NF-kappa-beta, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and matrix-degrading enzymes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis#H616794970\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Inflammatory mediators'</a>.)</p><p>The concept of TNF-alpha inhibition, which has been effective for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, has been applied to OA with mixed results with different TNF-alpha inhibitors.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Infliximab</a>, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-alpha, appears to have a potential effect on disease progression.

In another cohort of rheumatoid arthritis patients, intraarticular infliximab injections reduced the radiological progression of incident secondary hand OA after three years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The data for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, a fully human monoclonal antibody also directed against TNF-alpha, have shown mixed results in the treatment of OA. Several studies have failed to demonstrate improvements in hand OA pain with subcutaneous adalimumab injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, another randomized trial including 60 patients with erosive hand OA did show a significant decrease in the number of new erosions with subcutaneous adalimumab injections after 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>TNF-alpha blockade may not be the appropriate agent in a low-level inflammatory condition.

PRP can reduce inflammation in an OA joint by enhancing the expression of NF-kappa-beta inhibitor, and thus reduce NF-kappa-beta signaling and dampen its downstream inflammatory cytokine activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
