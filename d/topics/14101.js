Data from clinical cohorts and hospital discharges suggest that pregestational diabetes complicates 1 to 2 percent of all pregnancies and accounts for 13 to 21 percent of diabetes in pregnancy, with the remainder due to gestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The proportion of pregnant patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes reflects their prevalence in the specific population. In reproductive-aged women, type 2 diabetes is becoming more prevalent and is more common than type 1 diabetes in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H812232655\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to pregnancy, all women of childbearing age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should be counseled about the potential effects of diabetes and their medications on maternal and fetal outcomes and the potential impact of pregnancy on their diabetes control and any existing complications. The key components of preconception diabetes management are: glycemic control, proficient diabetes self-care, and medical optimization of preexisting complications and comorbidities associated with diabetes. Comprehensive and ongoing patient education is critical for shared decision-making about management goals and medication changes and for helping patients meet the considerable demands of increased self-care. </p><p>Type 1 and type 2 pregestational diabetes carry a significantly elevated risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including congenital malformations, miscarriage, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, macrosomia, and perinatal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Hyperglycemia is the primary driver of these risks, and studies repeatedly show that tight glycemic control in the periconception period and throughout pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. The first weeks of pregnancy when a woman may not know she is pregnant are particularly important because congenital malformations induced by hyperglycemia develop during this time (called diabetic embryopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Studies also suggest that early glycemia correlates with late pregnancy outcomes, including macrosomia, preeclampsia, and perinatal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12,13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15,16</a>]; however, randomized trials have not evaluated the impact of preconception control on these outcomes. </p><p>Pregnancy-induced metabolic and vascular changes can also affect glycemic control and development or progression of diabetes complications, including the threshold for developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Drivers in the metabolic environment other than glucose (eg, inflammation, oxidative stress) may also be associated with adverse outcomes and may explain why women with good glycemic control continue to have an excess risk of both macrosomia and preeclampsia. However, these pathways are not well defined and the observed risk may be due to glycemic excursions not captured by A1c or mean glucose values, the most commonly used measures of glycemic control in studies of pregnancy in women with pregestational diabetes. </p><p>Even though women with type 2 diabetes generally have a milder glycemic disturbance and shorter duration of disease than those with type 1 diabetes, a systematic review including 33 studies found that they did not have better perinatal outcomes (major congenital malformations, perinatal mortality) than those with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Women with type 2 diabetes may be less likely to prepare for pregnancy and achieve good glycemic control compared with those with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18</a>]. They are more likely to be obese, which may interfere with acceptable metabolic control or have independent adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes. These factors and others (eg, higher age and parity) may account for their equivalent outcomes. </p><p>While the risk of pregnancy complications may be similar for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there are some important differences. Women with type 1 diabetes are more likely to have pregestational microvascular complications and they are at higher risk of developing severe hypo- and hyperglycemia, including DKA. </p><p>The intense medical and lifestyle regimen that must be undertaken before and during pregnancy and worry over pregnancy outcome can have a significant impact on the diabetic woman's psychological well-being. Studies demonstrate that women with diabetes may feel high degrees of emotional distress (anger, fear, anxiety), which can interfere with their enjoyment of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the case of prior fetal loss or congenital malformation, women may also experience grief, guilt, and post-pregnancy depression. For this reason, it is important that preconception counseling, evaluation, and management be conducted with a patient-centered approach that emphasizes patient support and minimizes treatment-related stress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H812232689\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk counseling involves discussion of potential fetal, neonatal, obstetric, and maternal adverse outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9014694\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal and neonatal risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal and neonatal complications among women with pregestational diabetes range in severity from potentially mild (large for gestational age infant) to lethal (higher risk of miscarriage and some congenital malformations). The risk of these complications is directly related to glycemic control throughout pregnancy. Although the impact of preconception glycemic control on adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with pregestational diabetes has not been examined and will likely not be examined, given existing data, in randomized trials, observational data strongly suggest that glucose control in the periconceptional period to delivery can reduce these risks. The risks for congenital malformations and some causes of perinatal mortality can be reduced to levels close to those of patients without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8,9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9014700\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of congenital malformations (diabetic embryopathy) in women with pregestational diabetes is consistently reported to be two- to fourfold higher than that in women without diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108112 \">table 1</a>) and is strongly related to the degree of hyperglycemia in the periconceptional period. Rates of major congenital malformations in women with type 1 diabetes range from 2.9 to 7.5 percent compared with 2.1 to 12.3 in women with type 2 diabetes; periconceptional hyperglycemia is associated with the high end of the range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20</a>]. In an analysis of 1997 pregnancies resulting in live births from seven cohort studies, the risk of congenital abnormalities increased with increasing hemoglobin A1c: the absolute risk of a pregnancy affected by a congenital anomaly was approximately 2 percent at the nonpregnant nondiabetic population reference A1c of 5.5 percent, but increased to 2.7 percent at A1c 6.2 percent, 4 percent at A1c 7.6 percent, and 20 percent at A1c &ge;14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Conversely, a large population-based study of a cohort of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom demonstrated a 30 percent reduction in risk of major congenital malformations for every 1 percent lowering of maternal A1c [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The types of major congenital anomalies observed in women with pregestational diabetes are similar to those in women without diabetes and include congenital heart defects, neural tube defects, limb defects, and orofacial clefts. The most common abnormality, comprising 35 to 40 percent of major congenital anomalies, is congenital heart disease (including tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, septal defects, and anomalous pulmonary venous return)(OR 3.6. 95% CI 3.0-4.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]), followed by central nervous system defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, hydrocephaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">anotia/microtia)</span> and defects in the urogenital system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. Sacral <span class=\"nowrap\">agenesis/caudal</span> dysplasia (lack of fetal development of the caudal spine and corresponding segments of the spinal cord) is rare in the general population but highly associated with maternal diabetes, which accounts for 15 to 25 percent of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9014712\"><span class=\"h3\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with pregestational diabetes mellitus are at significantly higher risk of both <span class=\"nowrap\">medically/obstetrically-indicated</span> preterm delivery and spontaneous preterm delivery compared with women without diabetes (see <a href=\"#H1058001699\" class=\"local\">'Preterm delivery'</a> below).

They are more likely to have a higher percentage of body fat, larger shoulders and extremity circumferences, and a lower head-to-shoulder ratio than infants of similar weight and length. The reasons for these differences in body composition are unclear but are thought to be caused by increased maternal transfer of substrates (glucose, amino acids), leading to fetal hyperinsulinemia and subsequent effects of insulin on target tissues to promote growth and store excess nutrients as adipose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H812233426\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncommonly, pregestational diabetes is associated with failure of the fetus to achieve its genetic growth potential, which is termed intrauterine growth restriction and variously defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> weight &lt;3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, or 10<sup>th</sup> percentile (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Diagnosis&quot;</a>).

The diabetes type (1 or 2) in offspring is related, in part, to maternal and paternal diabetes status.

Although two large prospective studies of women with type 1 diabetes, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] and the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study (PCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], suggest that pregnancy alone is not a risk factor for the de novo development of microvascular complications, pregnancy can exacerbate preexisting microvascular disease, and this effect varies by type of complication. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9014754\"><span class=\"h4\">Diabetic retinopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of women with diabetic retinopathy will not experience worsening of retinopathy in or following pregnancy. However, for some, particularly those with proliferative retinopathy (marked by new retinal vessel growth), retinopathy may worsen during pregnancy (&quot;transient worsening&quot;) because of pregnancy-related vascular and volume changes. For a small subset of women with severe pregestational retinopathy, visual changes may persist postdelivery. </p><p>The likelihood of retinopathy progression is related to maternal duration of diabetes, presence and severity of existing retinopathy, and to the degree of glycemic control prior to and during pregnancy. Hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and hypoglycemia have also been associated with acceleration of retinopathy in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Rarely, retinopathy first develops in pregnancy.

Worsening of retinopathy in this setting is thought to be mediated by closure of small retinal blood vessels, which were narrowed but patent prior to tightening of glucose control. Correction of hyperglycemia may lower intravascular volume, leading to vessel closure. In most women, the benefits of normoglycemia for the fetus far outweigh the modest and generally transient deterioration in retinopathy from improved glycemic control, as milder forms of diabetic retinopathy typically improve after delivery. However, some women with severe proliferative retinopathy or with macular edema may experience persistence or even further progression of retinopathy postpregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>These relationships were illustrated by the Diabetes in Early Pregnancy (DIEP) study, a prospective study of 140 women with pregestational diabetes and no proliferative retinopathy at periconceptional baseline examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. At follow-up examination one month postpartum, progression of retinopathy was noted in 20 percent of women with microaneurysms or mild nonproliferative retinopathy at baseline and 55 percent of those with moderate to severe nonproliferative retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Proliferative retinopathy developed in 6 percent of women with mild baseline retinopathy and 29 percent of women with moderate to severe baseline retinopathy. Ten percent of women without retinopathy at baseline had signs of retinopathy postpartum on funduscopic examination.</p><p>Data on impact of intrapartum progression of retinopathy on the clinically meaningful outcome of postpartum vision are scant. One study reported postpartum women with diabetes had worse visual acuity as measured by letter recognition at nine weeks after delivery compared with nonpregnant women with diabetes followed for the same interval; however, the vision decrement was small, suggesting the impact of pregnancy in most women with pregestational diabetes is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Women with diabetes, moderately increased albuminuria (formerly microalbuminuria), and normal&nbsp;kidney function appear to be at low risk for loss of kidney function during pregnancy, but may have a transient increase in albuminuria. Among women with overt proteinuria at baseline, urinary protein excretion can rise dramatically as pregnancy progresses, but after delivery, protein excretion decreases in most women. </p><p>In contrast, women with poorly controlled hypertension or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and heavy proteinuria (serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> proteinuria &gt;3 grams in 24 hours) at the onset of pregnancy are at risk of permanent kidney damage, including end-stage kidney disease.

In a 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of preconception care in improving maternal and fetal outcomes for women with preexisting diabetes mellitus, preconception care was associated with significantly reduced rates of congenital malformation (relative risk [RR] 0.25, 95% CI 0.15-0.42), preterm delivery (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.90), and perinatal mortality (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.82) and a lower first trimester A1c level (average reduction 2.43 percent, 95% CI 2.27-2.58) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, women who participate in preconception planning are likely to be different from those who did not and therefore the improvement ascribed to prepregnancy care may be reflective of differences in populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends aiming for an A1c &lt;6.5 percent (48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> and the Endocrine Society recommends aiming for an A1c level &quot;as close to normal as possible&quot; (ie, &lt;6.5 percent [48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol])</span> without causing undue hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. </p><p>Since it takes two to three months to turn over A1c, women with diabetes should be encouraged to allow a minimum of six months to achieve optimal glucose control before trying to conceive, if they are not already well controlled. A1c goals during pregnancy are lower than in nonpregnant women because increased blood volume and red blood cell turnover during pregnancy cause a physiologic fall in A1c levels and because lower A1c levels are associated with better outcomes (see <a href=\"#H812232689\" class=\"local\">'Risk counseling'</a> above).

She should be instructed to carry a snack at all times. Those who have a history of hypoglycemia or who begin to experience hypoglycemia when tightening their glucose control should be given a prescription for glucagon and taught or retaught how to administer it. Reinforcement of hypoglycemia management is particularly important prepregnancy so the patient is prepared in early pregnancy when the frequency of hypoglycemia may increase due to tightened glucose control, changes in hormone levels, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and reduction in physical activity. Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in women with type 1 diabetes due to autoimmune destruction of the alpha cells that produce glucagon.</p><p>The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is increased in pregnancy, primarily in women with type 1 diabetes, but also in women with longstanding type 2 diabetes. Women should be aware of this risk and the symptoms, management, and consequences of DKA.
