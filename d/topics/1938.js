Their role, compared with other drugs, in the overall management of angina is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic effects of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) are mediated by activation of specific alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. There are at least three distinct types of beta receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-1, which are found primarily in heart muscle. Activation of these receptors results in increases in heart rate, contractility, and atrioventricular (AV) conduction, and a decrease in AV node refractoriness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-2, which are present in heart muscle but are more prominent in bronchial and peripheral vascular smooth muscle. Activation of these receptors results in vasodilatation and bronchodilatation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-3, which are found in adipose tissue and the heart. Activation of these receptors may mediate catecholamine-induced thermogenesis and may reduce cardiac contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p>Beta blockers act by competitively inhibiting catecholamines from binding to these receptors. Some are more selective for the beta-1 receptor. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cardioselectivity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Upregulation of beta receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta receptor density is a dynamic process that can change under varying physiologic conditions. In particular, chronic beta blocker therapy leads to an increase in receptor density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This can be clinically important, since sudden withdrawal of the beta blocker results in transient supersensitivity to catecholamines, possibly precipitating angina, myocardial infarction, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These complications can occur even in patients without previously apparent coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;, section on 'Beta blocker withdrawal'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular effects of beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The beneficial therapeutic effects of beta blockade in patients with stable angina pectoris are mediated by a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Myocardial oxygen demand varies directly with heart rate, contractility, and left ventricular wall stress, each of which is diminished by beta blockade. The decrease in wall stress is mediated in part by the antihypertensive action of these drugs.</p><p>The decline in heart rate is determined both by the degree to which the heart rate is sympathetically activated (as with exercise or stress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and to the properties of the beta blocker. Those drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may actually increase the resting heart rate. They are, however, still effective in the treatment of angina because it is the reduction in the exercise heart rate that is of primary importance. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity'</a> below.)</p><p>The negative inotropic effects of beta blockers may, at least theoretically, have a favorable impact on myocardial oxygen consumption in the patient with angina. In the past, beta blockers were avoided in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, from concern that negative inotropic effects could precipitate or worsen heart failure. However, extensive clinical experience and the results of major clinical trials have demonstrated that these agents actually prolong survival in patients with heart failure. In such patients, beta blocker therapy should be initiated at low dose, and volume overload should be corrected prior to the initiation of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers may also affect coronary blood flow, although there are competing effects. Beta blockers inhibit adrenergically mediated coronary vasodilation, thereby increasing coronary vascular resistance and decreasing coronary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, this potentially deleterious effect is overcome by the reductions in heart rate (which enhances coronary perfusion by prolonging diastole) and myocardial oxygen demand.</p><p>Nonselective beta blockers may exacerbate coronary vasospasm in patients with variant angina and should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasospastic-angina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasospastic angina&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different beta blockers are available for clinical use. Properties such as pharmacokinetics, cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and alpha adrenergic blocking activity are important characteristics that should be considered when choosing a particular agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the beta blockers have similar pharmacotherapeutic effects, their pharmacokinetic properties differ significantly in ways that may influence their clinical usefulness and side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among individual drugs, there are differences in completeness of gastrointestinal absorption, amount of first-pass hepatic metabolism, lipid solubility, protein binding, extent of distribution in the body, penetration into the brain, concentration in the heart, rate of hepatic biotransformation, pharmacologic activity of metabolites, and renal clearance of the drug and its metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>On the basis of their pharmacokinetic properties, the beta blockers can be classified into two broad categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those eliminated by hepatic metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those excreted unchanged by the kidney</p><p/><p>Drugs in the first group (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>) are lipid-soluble, almost completely absorbed by the small intestine, and largely metabolized by the liver. They enter the central nervous system (CNS) in high concentrations, possibly resulting in an increased incidence of CNS side effects. They tend to have highly variable bioavailability and relatively short plasma half-lives.</p><p>In contrast, drugs in the second category (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>) are more water soluble, incompletely absorbed through the gut, eliminated unchanged by the kidney, and do not as readily enter the CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. They show less variance in bioavailability and have longer plasma half-lives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardioselectivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardioselectivity refers to the ability of a drug to preferentially block the beta-1 receptors. Nonselective beta blockers have equal affinity for the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, while cardioselective agents will primarily inhibit the beta 1-receptors. Cardioselectivity is a relative property and substantial beta-2 receptor blockade can also occur at the higher doses that are often required to treat angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some beta blockers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pindolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a>) have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), also called partial agonist activity, providing low-grade beta stimulation at rest but acting as typical beta blockers when sympathetic activity is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Alpha-adrenergic blocking activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> block both beta and alpha receptors. As a result, they reduce peripheral and coronary vascular resistance. They are both non-selective beta blockers without ISA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE EFFECTS OF BETA BLOCKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers are generally well tolerated in patients with stable angina, but have a well-recognized set of potential side effects that can limit their use. The major side effects of beta blockers are discussed fully elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most frequent adverse effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreases in heart rate, contractility, and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoconstriction, due to beta-2 receptor blockade, can be induced by nonselective agents and high doses of cardioselective agents. As a result, many clinicians have assumed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma is a contraindication to beta blocker therapy. However, beta blockers are safe and effective in patients with mild <span class=\"nowrap\">COPD/asthma</span> who are not taking a beta-2 adrenergic agonist. Furthermore, some patients carry a diagnosis of COPD that has not been confirmed. The data supporting these observations primarily come from studies of patients with an acute coronary syndrome and are discussed elsewhere.

However, there appears to be no adverse effect on mild to moderate claudication symptoms when beta-1 selective blockers are used.

Although depression is often mentioned as a side effect of beta blockers, this association was not seen in randomized trials. Central side effects may be more common in older adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erectile dysfunction is often a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY OF BETA BLOCKERS IN STABLE ANGINA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the beta blockers, regardless of pharmacologic properties, appear to be equally effective in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. They improve exercise capacity, reduce exercise-induced ST depression, decrease the frequency of anginal episodes, and diminish the requirement for sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>. No randomized trials have examined the effect of beta blockers on survival in patients with stable angina. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Survival'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonselective agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propranolol</a> was the first beta blocker introduced clinically. It is a nonselective agent that has been used extensively for stable angina.</p><p>Evidence of long-term efficacy was provided in a study of 63 patients with severe stable angina who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> for five to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A 50 percent or greater reduction in anginal episodes occurred in 84 percent of patients. Those with a lesser or no response had a fourfold increase in mortality. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis to beta blockade.</p><p>Drug dose is an important determinant of response in patients with angina. Daily doses of 160 and 320 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, but not 80 mg, appear to be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardioselective drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, cardioselective beta blockers (the most commonly used being <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>) offer the potential advantage of not interfering with bronchodilatation or peripheral vasodilatation. The clinical applicability of this effect is uncertain since cardioselectivity may be lost at the high doses needed to treat angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Nevertheless, cardioselective drugs are used in most patients with stable angina.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atenolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> are as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> (and more effective than placebo) in reducing anginal attacks, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> use, and increasing exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In addition, once daily dosing of atenolol is as effective (and more convenient) as twice daily dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Metoprolol is available in a short acting form (metoprolol tartrate) for twice daily dosing and in a long acting form (metoprolol succinate) for once daily dosing.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> was demonstrated in the International Multicenter Angina Exercise (IMAGE) study in which 280 patients with chronic stable angina were randomly assigned to six weeks of therapy with long-acting preparations of metoprolol (200 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> (20 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Metoprolol reduced the frequency of angina and increased the mean exercise time to 1 mm ST segment depression. Furthermore, the increase in exercise time was significantly greater than that seen with nifedipine (70 versus 43 seconds).</p><p>Use of an appropriate dose is important. One report compared 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg once daily dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> with placebo in patients with angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All doses were more effective than placebo in reducing angina and the need for sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>; however, only the 100 and 200 mg doses increased exercise capacity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56323 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pindolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a> are as effective in treating angina as other beta blockers but have the potential advantage of causing less depression of cardiac function. One report, for example, compared the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> and pindolol in 52 patients with stable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Both agents were equally effective in relieving angina, but pindolol caused less pronounced resting bradycardia or impairment in left ventricular function. In another study, pindolol (when compared to propranolol) was associated with a higher resting heart rate and, at low levels of exercise, a higher heart rate, cardiac output, oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These differences disappeared at higher rates of exercise.</p><p>Despite some potential benefits, these drugs are rarely used in the treatment of stable angina except possibly in patients with underlying resting bradycardia.

There was no significant difference in adjusted all-cause mortality at three years between those discharged with beta blocker and those not (14 versus 13.3 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.03).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary therapeutic goal of beta blockers in chronic stable angina is to reduce the frequency and severity of angina and to improve exercise capacity without significant side effects. As noted above, the efficacy of beta blockers in relieving angina is dose-dependent. It is therefore important to be certain that adequate beta blockade has been attained.</p><p>With regard to the initiation of beta blocker therapy, we suggest starting at the lowest recommended dose for the chosen agent. Since the overall goal is a reduction in the frequency and severity of angina, it may not be necessary to titrate to high doses in some patients. Avoidance of high doses may decrease the likelihood of side effects. </p><p>Reasonable goals when titrating the dose include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting heart rate between 50 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The 2012 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS</span> guideline on stable ischemic heart disease recommends adjusting the beta blocker dose to achieve a resting heart rate of 55 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Among patients with more severe angina, the goal may be less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min,</span> assuming the absence of symptoms due to bradycardia or heart block. In addition, the exercise heart rate should not exceed 75 percent of the heart rate associated with the onset of ischemia.<br/><br/>Patients with resting bradycardia prior to therapy can be treated with nitrates, or, if a beta blocker is necessary, a drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Similar considerations apply to patients with atrioventricular conduction delay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunting of peak heart rate and blood pressure during exercise, which can be measured by the patient or during exercise testing, if performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of significant side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING AN AGENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the general efficacy of most beta blockers in the management of stable angina, ancillary properties, such as dosing interval and cost, become important considerations when determining which beta blocker to use. We generally use a cardioselective agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>). There are no major advantages of a nonselective agent, and there are potential disadvantages in patients with certain underlying diseases such as obstructive lung disease, asthma, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, and depression. Clearance of atenolol is dependent upon kidney functioning and active drug can accumulate in patients with renal impairment (CRCL &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). In general, we use metoprolol in patients with chronic kidney disease or unstable renal function because it is cleared by hepatic metabolism and does not need to be dose adjusted in renal impairment. </p><p>Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are rarely used in the treatment of stable angina except possibly in patients with underlying resting bradycardia. They may not decrease heart rate and blood pressure at rest and should not be given to patients with a prior myocardial infarction or heart failure in whom beta blockade improves survival.</p><p>We agree with the 2012 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Physicians/American</span> Association for Thoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">Surgery/Preventive</span> Cardiovascular Nurses <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Society</span> for Cardiovascular Angiography and <span class=\"nowrap\">Interventions/Society</span> of Thoracic Surgeons guideline on the diagnosis and management of stable ischemic heart disease, which reached the following conclusions on the role of beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers are recommended as initial therapy for the relief of anginal symptoms in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates are recommended when beta blockers are contraindicated or poorly tolerated and in addition to beta blockers when angina persists with beta blocker monotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H381820810\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of beta blockers in patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction is discussed elsewhere.

However, they have never been shown to decrease mortality in these individuals in the absence of myocardial infarction or heart failure associated with a reduction in left ventricular systolic function.</p><p>There are many different beta blockers approved for use for cardiovascular disorders. Since it is difficult to remember the ancillary properties, pharmacokinetics, and doses of all these agents, the physician should become familiar with one or two agents in each class (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pindolol</a>) for cardioselective, nonselective, and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, respectively. The choice of agent depends upon the clinical setting since all beta blockers are equally effective in treating angina.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unless contraindicated, we recommend that all patients with stable angina pectoris receive a beta blocker as first-line antianginal therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using a cardioselective agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-management-of-stable-ischemic-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lands AM, Arnold A, McAuliff JP, et al.
