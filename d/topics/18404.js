Since that time, the exact role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of RA has generated considerable debate.</p><p>Glucocorticoids exert both antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects via several mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system&quot;</a>).

Glucocorticoids effects may also be mediated by posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, by physicochemical interactions with biologic membranes, and by binding to membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors.</p><p>Among patients with RA, glucocorticoids may be administered via several different modalities. These include oral (short-term, chronic, and pulse), intramuscular, intravenous, and intraarticular routes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the use of glucocorticoids given both short-term and chronically in low doses, given intravenously as pulse therapy over a short period of time, and when administered by the intraarticular route in the treatment of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Especially when used for short-term (generally &lt;1 month) management of active joint disease, glucocorticoids are more effective than either placebo or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID).</p><p>Support for the value of short-term (ie, within the first month of therapy) glucocorticoid therapy comes from a year 2003 meta-analysis that included 10 studies utilizing random assignment of 320 patients with RA to groups that received glucocorticoids (equivalent to 15 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or less per day), placebo, or NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, mood disorders and hyperglycemia may be seen with daily treatment at these relatively low doses, although short-term treatment of early RA with even high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> has not been associated with long-term worsening of glucose tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The Combination Therapy Trial in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (COBRA) and the Behandel Strategieen (BeSt) trial demonstrated that higher-dose oral prednisone (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> tapering to 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> by week 6 and then stopping after week 12) in combination with other conventional DMARDs substantially inhibits the progression of radiographic joint damage, and this effect is sustained over many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. No studies have evaluated a more intermediate starting dose, such as 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>Clinical experience suggests that glucocorticoids continue to be effective for periods up to six months. Longer-term use is more controversial because of waning effectiveness in controlling symptoms and because of increasing risk of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of chronic use'</a> below.)</p><p>Short-term use of glucocorticoids has not been directly compared with biologic DMARDs.

We generally do not use glucocorticoids on a chronic basis without concurrent therapy with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or with DMARD combinations (eg, a nonbiologic traditional DMARD and a biologic agent). The main conclusions from randomized trials in which patients received 7.5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent were that there is initial symptomatic benefit, which may be sustained for up to two years at the initial dose, and that radiologic progression is reduced with such doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-19</a>]. These conclusions were best demonstrated in three randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial included 128 patients with RA of less than two years' duration who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> therapy (7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo; other DMARDs could also be prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Prednisolone was beneficial compared with placebo for pain at up to six months and for disability at up to 15 months. At two years, prednisolone therapy resulted in significantly fewer hand erosions (22 versus 46 percent). Among those initially administered prednisolone, an increase in erosions was seen one year after drug withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial involving 81 DMARD-na&iuml;ve patients with RA for less than one year who were assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo, greater clinical improvement in multiple measures was seen at six months in the patients treated with prednisone; however, the benefit was sustained only for joint tenderness at 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Radiographic progression was less in the prednisone-treated group, and this advantage persisted for at least three years following the completion of two years of prednisone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The prednisone group had more symptomatic benefit during the first three months; this difference was sustained but was not significantly different at the end of two years. In the group receiving prednisone plus MTX, there was less need for the additional DMARD (15 versus 41 percent, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in 2 versus 7 patients and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> in 16 versus 42 patients). The prednisone-treated patients experienced fewer adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal upset and elevated liver enzymes, possibly due to the lower average maximal dose of MTX in this group (19.7 versus 23.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span>. No vertebral fractures were noted.</p><p/><p>It is less clear whether similar efficacy to that seen with 7.5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be achieved with doses of 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of low-dose glucocorticoid therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> compared with placebo found that the benefits of chronic glucocorticoid therapy were temporary; improvement in the number of painful joints with prednisone was observed at 12 weeks but not at 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

There were no significant differences at two years between the two groups in the proportions of patients who developed new erosions or in the rate of joint space narrowing. The authors of the study speculated that the standardized use of a DMARD (sulfasalazine) and of alternative DMARDs in those who did not have a good clinical response in either group may have &quot;outweighed any prednisolone effect.&quot;</p><p/><p>In a nonrandomized prospective study of over 800 patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (or less) did not dramatically affect the rate of radiographic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Even lower doses, such as 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> continued indefinitely, may be effective in some patients.

The role of the delayed-release form in clinical practice, for which it is available in some countries, remains uncertain. The modified-release form of the drug was developed in an effort to more effectively reduce morning symptoms by countering the effects of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, that are produced late at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Thus, when chronic use is anticipated, the dose of glucocorticoids should be tapered as quickly as possible to the lowest effective dose, usually 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/45,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,54,55</a>].

Once the patient has improved further or after other effective agents have been added, glucocorticoid therapy should be slowly tapered over a period of months as tolerated.

Flares of disease may be treated by an increase in the dose of oral glucocorticoid, with the intention of reducing the dose once the flare is under control. For patients on chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy at less than or equal to 7.5 mg a day, increasing the prednisone to 15 mg a day in a single or divided dose for one to two weeks, then tapering to baseline prednisone dose over another two weeks is often adequate for management of a pauci- or polyarticular flare. For a severe flare, higher doses of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight may be necessary, tapered to baseline over approximately four to six weeks. Need for frequent increases of the prednisone dose for flare management should prompt consideration of changing the DMARD. Alternatively, pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> therapy, usually consisting of three separate infusions of up to 1000 mg of methylprednisolone given at weekly intervals, may rarely be used and may lead to marked temporary disease suppression.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risks of chronic use'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse therapy consists of the administration of high doses of glucocorticoids over a short period of time; pulse glucocorticoids remain a modality of last resort for the treatment of RA. The available studies examining pulse glucocorticoids are very limited, and serious cardiovascular adverse events and infections may occur. The utility of pulse glucocorticoid therapy among patients with RA has been limited to the treatment of acute flares and to the use as a therapeutic bridge between the initiation of and response to DMARDs. The average duration of response to pulse therapy alone is six to eight weeks. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pulse glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraarticular glucocorticoids are frequently helpful in the treatment of symptomatic synovitis in patients with RA; such therapy is palliative rather than disease-modifying. Intraarticular injections of multiple joints may have advantages over intramuscular injections for patients experiencing a disease flare. Although rare, risks associated with intraarticular injection include tendon rupture, osteonecrosis, acute synovitis (transient postinjection flare which usually resolves within 48 hours), septic arthritis, and systemic effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74660\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74660 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intraarticular therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraarticular and soft tissue injections: What agent(s) to inject and how frequently?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose of glucocorticoids should be tapered as quickly as possible to the lowest effective dose when chronic use is anticipated. Glucocorticoids are best administered in the morning to minimize interference with the normal diurnal hormonal pattern. Glucocorticoid therapy should be slowly tapered over a period of months, as tolerated, once the patient has improved further or after other effective agents have been added. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Chronic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain baseline studies to monitor toxicity, including serum glucose, a lipid profile, and appropriate studies for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. We monitor patients for the presence of polydipsia, edema, shortness of breath, visual changes, weight gain, and changes in blood pressure at each visit following the initiation of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring parameters'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Buttgereit F, Straub RH, Wehling M, Burmester GR.
