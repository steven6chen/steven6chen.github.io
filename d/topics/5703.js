Examples include hypertensive encephalopathy, acute pulmonary edema, aortic dissection, and rebound after abrupt withdrawal of antihypertensive medications. Immediate but careful reduction in blood pressure is often indicated in these settings. However, an excessive hypotensive response is potentially dangerous, possibly leading to ischemic complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or blindness. Thus, in patients who are severely hypertensive but asymptomatic, slower reductions in blood pressure may be achieved with oral agents. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Oral drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>The drugs that are used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies are presented in this topic.

This problem, which can manifest in as little as four hours, presents with altered mental status and lactic acidosis. Risk factors for nitroprusside-induced cyanide poisoning include a prolonged treatment period (&gt;24 to 48 hours), underlying renal impairment, and the use of doses that exceed the capacity of the body to detoxify cyanide (ie, more than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute). The risk of toxicity can be minimized by using the lowest possible dose, avoiding prolonged use (ie, no more than two or three days), and by careful patient monitoring (with special attention to unexplained acidemia or decreasing serum bicarbonate concentrations).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, doses of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute should never be given for more than 10 minutes.

It has less antihypertensive efficacy compared with other drugs used to treat hypertensive emergencies, and its effects on blood pressure are variable from person to person and, potentially, from minute to minute. However, it may be useful in patients with symptomatic coronary disease and in those with hypertension following coronary bypass.</p><p>The initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min,</span> which can be increased as necessary to a maximum of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span>. The onset of action is 2 to 5 minutes, while the duration of action is 5 to 10 minutes. Headache (due to direct vasodilation) and tachycardia (resulting from reflex sympathetic activation) are the primary adverse effects. Cyanide accumulation does not occur. Methemoglobinemia has been reported in patients receiving this agent for more than 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium channel blockers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clevidipine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clevidipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clevidipine</a> is an ultra short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that is approved for intravenous use to treat severe hypertension. The drug is hydrolyzed by serum esterases and has a serum elimination half-life of 5 to 15 minutes. It reduces blood pressure without affecting cardiac filling pressures but can cause reflex tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. Clevidipine is contraindicated in patients with severe aortic stenosis (because it increases the risk of severe hypotension), disordered lipid metabolism (because it is administered in a lipid-laden emulsion), or known allergies to soy or eggs (because these are used to produce the emulsion). It has not been compared with other short-acting drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>.

The initial dose is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> and can be increased to a maximum of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span>. Nicardipine has a better safety profile and a similar antihypertensive effect when compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The major limitations are a longer onset of action, which precludes rapid titration, and a longer serum elimination half-life (three to six hours).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352188424\"><span class=\"h2\">Dopamine-1 agonist</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fenoldopam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fenoldopam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fenoldopam</a> is a peripheral dopamine-1 receptor agonist which, unlike other parenteral antihypertensive agents, maintains or increases renal perfusion while it lowers blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fenoldopam may be particularly beneficial in patients with renal impairment. After starting at 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute, the dose can be titrated at 15-minute intervals to 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute, depending upon the blood pressure response. Some experts have used doses as high as 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute or higher without inducing toxicity.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fenoldopam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fenoldopam</a> should be used cautiously or not at all in patients with glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, because this agent is premixed in a solution containing sodium metabisulfite, caution is recommended for patients with sulfite sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352188453\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenergic-blocking agents</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Labetalol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> is a combined beta-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic blocker. Its rapid onset of action (five minutes or less) makes it a useful intravenous medication for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. However, one trial found that labetalol has less antihypertensive efficacy as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> is safe in patients with active coronary disease since it does not increase heart rate. However, labetalol should be avoided in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, heart failure, bradycardia, or greater than first-degree heart block. In addition, labetalol should not be used without prior adequate alpha blockade in patients with hyperadrenergic states, such as pheochromocytoma or cocaine or methamphetamine overdose, since unopposed, inadequately blocked alpha-adrenergic activity can increase blood pressure if beta blockade is not complete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> can be given as a series of intravenous bolus injections or as a constant-dose infusion. The bolus dose is 20 mg initially, followed by 20 to 80 mg every 10 minutes to a total dose of 300 mg. The infusion rate is 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Esmolol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Esmolol</a>, a relatively cardioselective beta blocker, is rapidly metabolized by blood esterases. Its effects begin almost immediately, and it has both a short half-life (about 9 minutes) and a short total duration of action (about 30 minutes), permitting rapid titration. Esmolol is often used during anesthesia to prevent postintubation hemodynamic perturbations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352188499\"><span class=\"h2\">Other agents</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydralazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydralazine</a> is a direct arteriolar vasodilator with little or no effect on the venous circulation. Thus, precautions are needed in patients with underlying coronary disease or aortic dissection, and a beta blocker should be given concurrently to minimize reflex sympathetic stimulation. The hypotensive response to hydralazine is less predictable than that seen with other parenteral agents. The use of parenteral hydralazine is primarily limited to pregnant women, although a reduction in the utero-placental blood flow has been reported in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydralazine</a> can be given as an intravenous bolus. The initial dose is 10 mg, with the maximum dose being 20 mg. The fall in blood pressure can be sudden and begins within 10 to 30 minutes and lasts two to four hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Enalaprilat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalaprilat-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Enalaprilat</a> is the intravenously active, des-ethyl ester of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a>. The hypotensive response to enalaprilat is unpredictable and depends upon the plasma volume and plasma renin activity in individual patients with a hypertensive emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Typically, hypovolemic patients with a high plasma renin activity are most likely to have an excessive hypotensive response. In addition, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy, severe renal artery stenosis with global ischemia, and severe hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The usual initial dose is 1.25 mg. As much as 5 mg may be given every six hours as necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drugs-used-for-the-treatment-of-hypertensive-emergencies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The onset of action begins in 15 minutes, but the peak effect may not be seen for four hours. The duration of action ranges from 12 to 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Phentolamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phentolamine</a> is a nonselective alpha-adrenergic blocker, the use of which is limited to the treatment of severe hypertension due to increased catecholamine activity. Examples include pheochromocytoma or tyramine ingestion in a patient being treated with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pheochromocytoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pheochromocytoma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phentolamine</a> is given as an intravenous bolus. The usual dose is 10 to 15 mg every 5 to 15 minutes as necessary. Patients receiving this agent who do not require intravenous therapy can be converted to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenoxybenzamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenoxybenzamine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ORAL DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral antihypertensive agents usually lower the blood pressure more slowly than parenteral drugs. Thus, they are primarily used when parenteral agents are not available or when there is severe hypertension without serious acute end-organ damage; see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-asymptomatic-hypertension-hypertensive-urgencies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Management of severe asymptomatic hypertension (hypertensive urgencies) in adults</a> for a discussion of this issue, and see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601532368\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
