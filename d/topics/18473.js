Currently, the Valsalva maneuver is primarily used in clinical practice in the diagnosis and treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias as well as for the assessment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12117488\"><span class=\"h2\">Valsalva maneuver technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various descriptions of the technique of performing a Valsalva maneuver exist.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, the patient is placed in a supine or semirecumbent position and instructed to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis after a normal inspiratory effort (ie, at tidal volume).

When feasible, the modified Valsalva maneuver should be performed given the greater likelihood of successful restoration of sinus rhythm.

Patients who are performing the Valsalva maneuver for diagnostic purposes in this setting should have continuous blood pressure monitoring along with continuous heart rate monitoring (single-lead telemetry is adequate here) during the maneuver. When non-invasively monitoring blood pressure responses using a blood pressure cuff, the cuff should be inflated to approximately 15 mmHg above the patient's resting systolic blood pressure, and the investigator should auscultate the brachial artery throughout the maneuver and for 15 to 30 seconds afterward.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12117580\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure responses following a Valsalva maneuver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expected blood pressure response in normal subjects is divided into four phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78776 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Phases 1 and 2 occur during the active strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, while phases 3 and 4 occur after the strain phase has been completed.

Relative tachycardia may occur during this phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase 3 occurs after release of the strain and is distinguished by an abrupt fall in systolic blood pressure below baseline.

Additional exclusion criteria have been used in some studies including recent myocardial infarction, history of ventricular arrhythmia, immobility, blindness, and cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom carotid sinus massage is needed as part of an evaluation (ie, in the evaluation of carotid sinus hypersensitivity), there are few data to infuse in the discussion of screening for carotid disease with any means other than auscultation for carotid bruits (eg, carotid ultrasound, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-asymptomatic-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with paroxysmal SVT in whom there is concern about increased risk of stroke due to carotid sinus massage, alternative vagal maneuvers (eg, Valsalva maneuver) should be utilized.

In humans, the diving reflex has been studied as a tool to assess the autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Similar to other vagal maneuvers, the diving reflex can potentially terminate paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). However, due to the complexities involved, it is rarely used in modern clinical medicine. </p><p>A variety of techniques to elicit a diving reflex has been tried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Most commonly, the patient is seated in front of a basin of water (at a temperature of 10 to 20&ordm;C) and is attached to continuous electrocardiographic monitoring (ideally, continuous 12-lead electrocardiography, but if this is not available or practical then continuous single-lead telemetry monitoring). The patient takes a moderate breath, holds it, and then submerges his or her face in water for 20 to 30 seconds. A bradycardic response usually occurs within 10 to 30 seconds of breath holding. If the inspiration is too deep, increased intrathoracic pressure may attenuate the bradycardic response. Contact of the area innervated by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve seems to be particularly important in eliciting a response.</p><p>The expected response in normal subjects results from a combination of facial immersion and breath holding. The expected effect is parasympathetic-mediated bradycardia and sympathetic-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction, ideally resulting in termination of the SVT. Although its role is limited, this maneuver may be preferred in patients who should not be performing a Valsalva maneuver (eg, pregnant women with SVT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OCULOCARDIAC REFLEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a clinical tool, the oculocardiac reflex is poorly defined and rarely used. It has been used to terminate supraventricular tachycardias and in the diagnostic evaluation of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. However, due to limited utility, associated risks, and the availability of alternative maneuvers, we do not perform this test in clinical practice.</p><p>The oculocardiac reflex involves a decrease in heart rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood pressure in response to eyeball pressure. The reflex is thought to originate from the ophthalmic portion of the trigeminal nerve. Afferent stimuli move through the reticular formation and nuclei of the vagus nerve output and proceed via an efferent link through the vagus nerve to cardiovascular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This oculocardiac reflex is most often recognized in the context of ophthalmic surgery. Pressure or traction on the orbital contents, globe, or extra-ocular muscles can produce unwanted and sometimes dangerous consequences, which on rare occasions can include lethal arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagal-maneuvers/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In appropriately selected patients, vagal maneuvers are generally safe.

Various physical maneuvers can elicit autonomic responses, including a wide variety that can have intended or unintended influence on increasing vagal tone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the heart, parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation causes local release of acetylcholine, which results in slowing of sinus node impulse formation and slowed conduction with lengthening of the refractory period in the atrioventricular (AV) node. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac responses to vagal stimulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vagal maneuvers can be performed in a variety of clinical settings for diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapeutic purposes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67134 \">table 1</a>), including the evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), AV block, syncope, and cardiac murmurs. (See <a href=\"#H174924676\" class=\"local\">'Clinical uses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of a particular vagal maneuver is dependent on the clinical scenario and the patient's ability to successfully perform some of the maneuvers. Our approach to choosing a vagal maneuver for the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios is as follows (see <a href=\"#H174925237\" class=\"local\">'Choice of maneuver'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapeutic use in a patient with SVT, we typically start with the Valsalva maneuver and employ the modified Valsalva when possible, as the Valsalva maneuver appears to be more effective in terminating SVT than other vagal maneuvers. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Valsalva maneuver'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected carotid sinus hypersensitivity, we use carotid sinus massage. (See <a href=\"#H80135632\" class=\"local\">'Carotid sinus massage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For diagnostic evaluation of a cardiac murmur, we use the Valsalva maneuver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In appropriately selected patients, vagal maneuvers are generally safe. However, there are potential contraindications and complications to performing vagal maneuvers. While noncardiac side effects are rare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79543 \">table 2</a>), interventions that alter cardiac conduction properties can result in adverse events, including sinus pauses, AV block, and, rarely, tachyarrhythmias.
