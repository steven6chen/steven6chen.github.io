Children with aortic coarctation are born with the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130673\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of aortic coarctation in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most babies and children have no symptoms. In some cases, a routine imaging test (called an &quot;ultrasound&quot;) that women have during pregnancy might show the baby has narrowing of the aorta.</p><p>Newborn infants with severe narrowing of the aorta might have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crying and fussing more than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p>Older babies and children can have symptoms, especially when they are physically active, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain or leg cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold hands and feet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130688\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for aortic coarctation in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor will do an exam and measure your child's pulse and blood pressure in his or her arms and legs. Children with this condition have a weaker pulse and lower blood pressure in their legs than in their arms.</p><p>Other tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity of the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to take pictures of the heart and aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An MRI or CT scan &ndash; These tests take pictures of the heart and aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130703\"><span class=\"h1\">How is aortic coarctation in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment will depend on your child's age, size, and symptoms. Newborns with serious symptoms might need medicines given through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV&quot;.</p><p>Other treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioplasty &ndash; A doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in the leg or arm and advances the tube to the aorta. Then the doctor inflates a balloon inside the aorta to widen it. In older children, the doctor might prop open the aorta using a mesh tube called a &quot;stent.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Different types of surgery can fix the narrowed aorta. The doctor might remove the narrowed part of the aorta. In other cases, he or she uses a plastic tube called a &quot;graft&quot; or a piece of another one of your child's blood vessels to fix the aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12130719\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children with aortic coarctation are able to live normal lives. But aortic coarctation can return after treatment. This means your child will need to see his or her doctor on a regular basis. How often will depend on your child's condition. Also, you should check with your doctor about whether your child should not do certain activities or sports.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
