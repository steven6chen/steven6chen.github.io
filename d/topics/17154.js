Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by suppressing osteoclast activity. They are widely used in the management of lytic bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, in the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcemia, and in the therapy of certain other bone diseases.</p><p>Lytic skeletal lesions are present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 60 percent of patients with MM and almost all patients with MM will have lytic bone lesions at some point in their disease course. In addition, up to 20 percent of patients with MM will have osteopenia and 10 to 15 percent will have hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The use of bisphosphonate therapy and other osteoclast inhibitors in patients with MM will be presented here. The role of bisphosphonate therapy in the management of other disorders is presented separately, as are the specific side effects associated with each agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypercalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks of therapy with bone antiresorptive agents in patients with advanced malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H487374\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the exact mechanism is unknown, bisphosphonates appear to inhibit bone resorption by suppressing osteoclast activity. Clinically, this translates into fewer lytic bone lesions and fewer skeletal events (eg, pathologic fracture) in patients with MM. Bisphosphonates are attracted to calcium and calcium containing molecules, such as hydroxyapatite, which is the major calcium-containing mineral in bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bone resorption by osteoclasts results in the exposure of molecules of hydroxyapatite within the lytic lesions. Bisphosphonates are attracted to the hydroxyapatite and accumulate in this space, thereby creating a high local concentration of drug and inhibiting further osteoclast activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Although the exact half-life is unknown, bisphosphonates that are incorporated into bone are thought to remain for at least 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There are two main classes of bisphosphonates, each with a different proposed mechanism of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etidronate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clodronate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clodronate</a> are non-nitrogen containing bisphosphonates. Non-nitrogen containing bisphosphonates are metabolized to cytotoxic ATP analogues, incorporated into the osteoclast, and induce osteoclast apoptosis. In contrast, nitrogen containing bisphosphonates are proposed to suppress osteoclast activity by binding to and inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pamidronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> are examples of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates.</p><p>Bisphosphonates also appear to affect the microenvironment in which tumor cells grow and may have direct anti-tumor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].

We also suggest the use of bisphosphonates for patients with MM who do not have lytic bone lesions on radiography but demonstrate osteopenia or osteoporosis on bone mineral density or have bone lesions identified with other imaging studies (eg, CT, MRI, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT)</span>. It is unknown whether bisphosphonates benefit patients with MM who have no bone lesions identified on MRI or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span>.</p><p>Our decision to use bisphosphonates is based upon numerous prospective, randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-20</a>] and two systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] that have demonstrated that bisphosphonates reduce the number of vertebral fractures, skeletal related events, and associated pain in patients with MM and skeletal lesions. While some studies have suggested a survival benefit in subpopulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11,12,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14-17</a>], others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review found that, when compared with placebo or no treatment, bisphosphonate therapy resulted in the following beneficial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of pathological vertebral fractures (relative risk [RR] of 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer skeletal related events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.89)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better control of skeletal related pain (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95) </p><p/><p>Bisphosphonates did not appear to improve overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.82-1.13) or progression-free survival (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.41-1.19). However, there was significant heterogeneity among various bisphosphonates with respect to their effect on overall survival. There appeared to be a <span class=\"nowrap\">dose/potency</span> effect with a subset analysis suggesting improved survival with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.81-0.22).</p><p>When assuming the baseline risk of vertebral fracture without treatment to be 20 to 50 percent, this analysis estimated that between 8 and 20 patients should be treated to prevent vertebral fracture in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Likewise, it estimated that between 5 and 13 patients should be treated to reduce pain in one patient. Since intravenous bisphosphonates have a beneficial impact on pain control, their use is recommended for patients with pain due to osteolytic disease, and as an adjunct to radiation therapy, analgesics, or surgical intervention to stabilize fractures or impending fractures. Pain control appears to take effect relatively rapidly. At least one study noted an onset of analgesia within approximately one week of beginning intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> in patients with symptomatic bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Additional methods for managing skeletal events in patients with MM are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the complications of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Skeletal lesions'</a>.)</p><p>Randomized trials have not formally studied the effect of bisphosphonates in patients with bone lesions identified by CT, MRI, or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> that are not visualized on skeletal X-rays. However, treatment of this subgroup with monthly intravenous bisphosphonate therapy is supported by the Medical Research Council (Myeloma IX) trial, which demonstrated that patients with MM without bone disease on skeletal X-rays who were receiving anti-MM treatment experienced less skeletal events with monthly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> compared with daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clodronate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clodronate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, less invasive procedures such as dental cleaning, cavity repairs, placement of crowns, and root canals are not thought to be risk factors for ONJ. It is prudent to advise patients to avoid these dental procedures while receiving intravenous bisphosphonates as well as to identify and rectify dental problems before treatment with these agents. As such, all patients should receive a comprehensive dental examination and appropriate preventive dentistry before starting treatment with bisphosphonates. Active oral infections should be treated and sites at high risk for infection should be eliminated. While on therapy, patients should maintain excellent oral hygiene and avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible.

Patients received standard antimyeloma therapy along with either placebo or pamidronate (90 mg) as a four-hour intravenous infusion given every four weeks for nine cycles. Patients were monitored for skeletal events, which included pathologic fracture, irradiation of or surgery on bone, and spinal cord compression. After a median follow-up of nine months, patients assigned to pamidronate therapy had a significantly lower rate of skeletal events (24 versus 41 percent). Pamidronate therapy was also associated with a significant reduction in bone pain. </p><p>A later report from the same investigators extended the evaluation to 21 cycles of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> was associated with a significantly lower number of skeletal events per patient per year (1.3 versus 2.2 with placebo). There was no improvement in overall survival in the pamidronate group as a whole. On subgroup analysis, there appeared to be a survival benefit for patients who also received second-line antimyeloma therapy (14 versus 21 months). These benefits appeared to be associated with reduced bone marrow plasmacytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Lower doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> may be just as effective as the 90 mg dose, but require further study.

The 30 mg dose resulted in similar improvement in quality of life measures, median time to first skeletal-related event (10.2 versus 9.2 months), median overall survival (48 versus 42 months), and median progression-free survival (22 versus 21 months). In a retrospective analysis, patients assigned to the 30 mg dose demonstrated a nonsignificant trend towards less renal toxicity and a lower incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H487402\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous zoledronic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (4 mg over 15 minutes) can be administered every three to four weeks for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and lytic destruction of bone or spine compression fracture from osteopenia on plain radiograph or imaging studies.

Both agents were well tolerated and had similar rates of acute renal failure (5.2 versus 5.8 percent at two years) and serious adverse events; zoledronic acid was associated with a higher rate of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw (4 versus &lt;1 percent). Most cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were preceded by dental surgery or trauma, occurred after a median of 24 months, and were low grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

However, the number of patients who achieved a complete response was low, and the cumulative incidence of skeletal events in this subpopulation is expected to be very low, thereby limiting the power of this study to detect a benefit of bisphosphonate therapy in this subpopulation.</p><p>In the CALGB 70604 trial, 1822 patients with MM or bone metastases from solid malignancies were randomly assigned to the same dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (adjusted based upon calculated creatinine clearance) monthly or every three months for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a preliminary report available in abstract form, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed at least one skeletal related event (29 percent in both groups, absolute difference 0, 95% CI -3.3 to +5.1 percent), the time to first skeletal related event, pain scores, and the proportion of patients who developed renal dysfunction (1.2 versus 0.6 percent with monthly versus every three month therapy) or jaw osteonecrosis (2 versus 1 percent). Subgroup analysis suggested that the results among those with MM were similar to the group as a whole. These results suggest that lengthening the time between treatments to three months results in a less than 5 percent difference in skeletal related events.

Most clinicians agree that bisphosphonates should be restarted upon relapse; however, some reinitiate bisphosphonates only in those with bone pain, those who develop progressive bone involvement at relapse, or those who experience a new skeletal complication. If the myeloma still requires treatment after two years, some clinicians decrease the frequency of bisphosphonate infusions to every three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There are no data from clinical trials to support either the recommendation to discontinue these drugs among patients without &quot;active bone disease&quot; or with responsive disease after two years of monthly treatment. There are also no data to suggest that schedules other than monthly administration of these drugs are effective. Randomized clinical trials are underway to determine whether longer-term bisphosphonate therapy is required, and whether less frequent dosing (eg, every three months versus every month) is adequate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Response criteria'</a>.) </p><p>Bisphosphonates have been thought of as supportive therapy aimed at decreasing the development of lytic bone lesions. They can be administered in conjunction with antimyeloma therapy directed at the plasma cell clone. These drugs do not appear to increase the toxicity of the currently used anti-myeloma agents. If the myeloma progresses during therapy, bisphosphonate therapy is continued while antimyeloma therapy is altered. Similarly, bisphosphonate therapy is continued if the patient has a skeletal event (eg, a compression fracture or pathologic fracture) since the drugs reduce the relative number but do not prevent these complications altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Bisphosphonates may not only prevent skeletal complications, but also improve the overall survival of patients with MM. This benefit was suggested in the MRC Myeloma IX trial, which demonstrated longer overall survival rates in patients with previously untreated MM who received monthly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>, when compared with patients who received oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clodronate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clodronate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
