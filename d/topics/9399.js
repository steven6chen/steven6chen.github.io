Although measurement of the serum creatinine concentration is widely used for the detection of AKI, it does not permit early diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), since tubular injury precedes a significant rise in serum creatinine. Investigational biomarkers have been evaluated in patients with possible ATN in an attempt to detect tubular injury at an earlier stage. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved use of the first platform measuring tissue inhibitor of <span class=\"nowrap\">metalloproteinases-2/insulin-like</span> growth factor-binding protein 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">(TIMP-2/IGFBP7)</span> to assess for the development of AKI.</p><p>We discuss here biomarkers that are being studied for the diagnosis of ATN. The pathophysiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation and diagnosis of prerenal disease and ATN are discussed elsewhere.

Although the serum creatinine is widely used in diagnosing the presence of AKI, it is a suboptimal biomarker. It is a lagging marker of change in kidney function; therefore, it has poor sensitivity for the early diagnosis of AKI, and, as a marker of glomerular filtration, it is unable to differentiate among the various causes of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, the rise in serum creatinine is slow following the onset of AKI. By the time a change is observed in the serum creatinine, a critical therapeutic window may have been missed, particularly among those with ATN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, different urinary and serum proteins have been intensively investigated as possible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of ATN. There are promising candidate biomarkers that report on kidney and tubule function, detect an early and graded increase in tubular epithelial cell injury, and distinguish prerenal disease from ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. These novel biomarkers have therefore the potential to reflect physiologic and pathophysiologic processes of the injured kidney. Some biomarkers are detected in the urine of patients without a diagnostic increase in serum creatinine, which defines a group of patients with &quot;subclinical AKI&quot; who are at risk for adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Biomarkers are used in clinical investigation to facilitate early randomization to different treatment arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These vanguard studies using biomarkers may lead to the identification of new therapies and the practical use of biomarkers in routine patient care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/8,9,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14-16</a>]. Future studies are also needed to investigate whether biomarker profiles can be matched to unique injuries. For instance, sepsis-associated AKI may have a biomarker profile that is distinctly different from that of nephrotoxin-associated AKI.</p><p>Although many candidate biomarkers have been identified, the following steps are necessary before they are used clinically:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Validation in different settings of AKI (cardiac surgery, sepsis, contrast-induced nephropathy, emergency and pediatric medicine) and in different clinical centers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development and testing of rapid assays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of a panel of biomarkers.

Urinary biomarker excretion may be reported as an absolute concentration or normalized to creatinine excretion. One study that compared these methods showed that the biomarker normalized to creatinine best predicted death, dialysis, or the development of AKI, although the absolute concentration best diagnosed AKI on admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732289043\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22961941\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tubular enzymes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tubular enzymes consist of proximal renal tubular epithelial antigen (HRTE-1), alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST), pi-glutathione S-transferase (pi-GST), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT), alanine aminopeptidase (AAP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Most of these are released from proximal tubular epithelial cells within 12 hours and four days earlier than a detectable rise in serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>].

They are produced at different sites, filtered at the glomerulus, and reabsorbed at the proximal tubule with no secretion. Although promising prognostically and to help distinguish prerenal disease from ATN, increased levels may be observed after reversible and mild dysfunction and may not necessarily be associated with persistent or irreversible damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/9,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22961955\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NGAL is markedly upregulated and abundantly expressed in the kidney after renal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this setting, NGAL may function to dampen toxicity by reducing apoptosis and increasing the normal proliferation of kidney tubule cells. In addition, by enhancing the delivery of iron, NGAL upregulates heme oxygenase-1, thereby helping protect kidney tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>].

Furthermore, NGAL can differentiate prerenal disease from ATN. Using an NGAL reporter mouse, the NGAL-Luc2-mC reporter responds to endogenous signals that illuminate sites of injury (NGAL expression) in vivo and in real time. They found that, following ischemia reperfusion, as evidenced by a rise in creatinine, the kidneys illuminate, indicating NGAL production at the site of injury. Interestingly, following maneuvers that lead to significant prerenal disease associated with hypernatremia, there was no NGAL illumination, indicating that prerenal disease does not induce NGAL expression. Thus, NGAL may potentially be useful in differentiating prerenal disease from ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biomarkers-and-the-evaluation-of-acute-tubular-necrosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>NGAL has been tested in multiple studies of patients at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, cardiac surgery, exposure to contrast media, or after renal transplantation.

Although measurement of the serum creatinine concentration is widely used for the detection of AKI, it does not permit early diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), since tubular injury precedes a significant rise in serum creatinine. Investigational biomarkers have been evaluated in patients with possible ATN in an attempt to detect tubular injury at an earlier stage. None have been approved for clinical use in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H732288866\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various urinary and serum proteins have been intensively investigated as possible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of ATN. Before any such proteins are used clinically, validation in different settings of AKI and the development and testing of rapid assays are necessary. It is possible that a panel of biomarkers will be required for clinical utility or serial measurements of a specific marker. In addition, it needs to be shown if there is an association between levels of biomarkers and outcome. (See <a href=\"#H22961934\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of AKI include neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), urinary interleukin-18 (IL-18), and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), among others. (See <a href=\"#H732289043\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic biomarkers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary angiotensinogen may be useful as a prognostic marker for severe AKI (see <a href=\"#H732289067\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic biomarkers'</a> above), and urinary insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) have been shown to predict AKI and long-term dialysis or death.
