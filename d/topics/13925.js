Symptoms may be severe enough to interfere with sleep, appetite, or sexual function. In addition, a variable percentage of patients may continue to experience pain for months to years after the resolution of the rash, a condition known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN can be quite difficult to treat.</p><p>The pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of PHN are reviewed here. Other aspects of the varicella-zoster virus and the acute therapy of herpes zoster infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-zoster-in-the-immunocompetent-host\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The virus persists for a period of years in the dorsal root ganglia of cranial or spinal nerves after resolution of the original infection. As cellular immunity wanes with age or immunocompromise, the virus is transported along peripheral nerves, producing an acute neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>At the cellular level, infection with acute herpes zoster is characterized by hemorrhagic inflammation of the peripheral nerve, dorsal root, and dorsal root ganglion. Extension centrally into the spinal cord and leptomeninges also has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fibrosis is noted in the dorsal root ganglion, nerve root, and peripheral nerve upon resolution of the acute process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Autopsy data for cases of well-established PHN are limited. One study reported five cases, three with severe PHN and two with no persistent pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The findings included dorsal horn atrophy as well as cellular, axonal, and myelin loss with fibrosis in the sensory ganglion in patients with persistent pain. However, marked axonal and myelin loss in the nerve <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory root were found in cases with and without pain.</p><p>A search for responsible neurotransmitters in PHN has been difficult. Substance P is a peptide implicated in the transmission of pain signals, while serotonin and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters thought to play a role in the inhibition of pain signals. Studies of the affected dorsal horn from one patient with PHN failed to demonstrate differences in the levels of these neurotransmitters when compared with the unaffected side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The same investigators were unable to demonstrate a deficiency of opiate receptors in the affected dorsal horn. Another study evaluated cytokine profiles extracted from skin punch biopsies of dermatomes affected by PHN and found no significant differences when compared with skin biopsies from the normal contralateral side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There are three phases of pain associated with herpes zoster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute herpetic neuralgia refers to pain preceding or accompanying the eruption of rash that persists up to 30 days from its onset</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute herpetic neuralgia refers to pain that persists beyond healing of the rash but which resolves within four months of onset</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PHN refers to pain persisting beyond four months from the initial onset of the rash</p><p/><p>The pain of acute herpetic neuralgia probably is produced both by the inflammation associated with the movement of viral particles from sensory nerves to skin and subcutaneous tissues, and by the damage to nerve structures detailed above. In addition, activity of primary afferent neurons that respond to tissue damage causes changes in the dorsal horn neurons, sensitizing them to further input and resulting in spontaneous activity capable of maintaining pain in the absence of ongoing tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/7,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12-15</a>]. The persistence of this response may explain the continuing pain of PHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Some have speculated that ongoing VZV viral replication might be responsible for PHN. However, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> for 56 days in 10 patients with severe PHN of at least six months duration failed to influence the course of PHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336152504\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acute herpes zoster infection increases with impairment of the immune system due to age, disease, or chemotherapy. The annual incidence among healthy people under the age of 20 years is approximately 1 per 1000; the incidence is 5 to 10 times greater for those older than 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Herpes zoster also is several times more common in patients with cancer or HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, the probability of developing PHN increases with advanced age. Most studies agree that PHN is rare in children. In adults younger than 60 years of age with herpes zoster, the risk of PHN is estimated to be less than 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The best incidence data in older patients come from the placebo arm of a large randomized trial that evaluated vaccination against the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In 334 patients 60 to 69 years of age who developed herpes zoster and were followed for a median of 3.1 years, PHN occurred in 6.9 percent. In contrast, among 308 patients age 70 years or older who developed herpes zoster, PHN occurred in 18.5 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336152951\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk factors for PHN are older age, greater acute pain, and greater rash severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. The risk of PHN is probably increased as well with immunosuppression, although the evidence is not entirely consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In patients who develop PHN, advanced age is associated with increasing severity and persistence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With PHN, thoracic (especially T4 to T6), cervical, and trigeminal nerves are most commonly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The pain associated with acute zoster infection and PHN can be burning, sharp, or stabbing and constant or intermittent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/9,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31</a>]. More than 90 percent of patients with PHN also have allodynia, defined as pain evoked by normally nonpainful stimuli such as light touch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Patients with PHN often demonstrate areas of anesthesia, as well as deficits of thermal, tactile, pinprick, and vibration sensation within the affected dermatomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The contralateral, uninvolved side tests normally. Sensory deficits may extend beyond dermatomal margins. It has been suggested that allodynia is most prominent in areas of relatively preserved sensation, while spontaneous pain is felt predominately within the area of lost or impaired sensation.</p><p>PHN most often represents a continuum of pain that never resolved following an acute episode of herpes zoster. However, PHN rarely has been reported to occur months to years after resolution of the initial event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These episodes occurred in the same distribution as the initial rash and were precipitated by a specific event (eg, a surgical procedure, tooth abscess).</p><p>Both acute zoster and PHN can be severe conditions associated with profound psychosocial dysfunction including impaired sleep, decreased appetite, and diminished libido [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H336152363\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the diagnosis of PHN is straightforward and is made when pain persists beyond four months in the same distribution as a preceding documented episode of acute herpes zoster (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>).

Uncommonly, the nerve pain in acute herpes zoster may emerge in the absence of any skin eruption, as occurs in a condition called &quot;zoster sine herpete&quot; or in intercostal neuralgia. The presence of pain in trigeminal or radicular distribution combined with the detection of varicella-zoster virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid supports the diagnosis of zoster sine herpete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p>On examination, the areas affected by PHN may be remarkable for scarring related to the vesicular eruption of the preceding acute herpes zoster infection, or by areas of excoriation caused by scratching. The affected skin may display decreased sensation to mechanical and thermal stimuli, hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to painful stimuli), or allodynia (pain produced by normally non-noxious stimulation). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> are generally the drugs of first choice for the treatment of PHN. In systematic reviews, treatments more effective than placebo for PHN include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, and opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. The long-term benefits of most therapies are uncertain, and side effects are common. </p><p>Because the pain of PHN may be chronic, long-term therapy is often required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>We recommend initial treatment with one of the nonopioid agents effective in controlled trials, ie, tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>. The choice among treatments for PHN should be individualized according to patient-specific characteristics, comorbid conditions, medication side effect profile, and patient values and preferences. Based upon the available data and our experience, we typically use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest initial treatment with a tricyclic drug for most patients with moderate to severe pain from PHN. Exceptions include patients with heart disease, epilepsy, or glaucoma. Because of their anticholinergic effects, tricyclic drugs should be used cautiously in older patients, particularly those with cognitive impairment or dementia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Tricyclic antidepressants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> for patients with moderate to severe PHN who have contraindications to or intolerance of tricyclic antidepressants. Gabapentin and pregabalin should be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Anticonvulsants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> for patients with mild to moderate localized pain from PHN who do not desire systemic therapy with tricyclic drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>. However, topical capsaicin is often poorly tolerated. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is an alternative that may provide short-term relief. (See <a href=\"#H799183186\" class=\"local\">'Capsaicin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids are associated with the potential for abuse and addiction, and thus many experts consider them as second- or third-line treatment options for PHN. However, opioids can be used cautiously if the preventive agents (tricyclic drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) are unsuccessful. Opioids also can also be administered simultaneously with the nonopioid preventive agents, since the nonopioid drugs may not be immediately effective. Opioids should be initiated at low doses, if used, and titrated to provide relief while awaiting benefit from preventive treatments, at which point opioids should be tapered off. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Opioids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrathecal glucocorticoid injections are an option for patients who continue to have intractable pain despite the above measures. These injections do not work for pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Intrathecal glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The evidence supporting these recommendations is reviewed in the sections that follow. Mild analgesics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are of limited value in patients with either acute herpetic neuralgia or PHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medications are effective for PHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], and they are often thought of as the mainstay of therapy. These drugs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the central nervous system. They are thought to increase the inhibition of nociceptive signals from the periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of TCAs was originally demonstrated in a small study of 24 patients with PHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postherpetic-neuralgia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

A mean amitriptyline dose of 65 mg per day was achieved. Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than lorazepam or inactive placebo in providing moderate relief of pain (47, 15, and 16 percent, respectively). Equal numbers of patients withdrew from each group due to side effects. There was a significant correlation between the degree of symptom relief and serum amitriptyline levels. The authors concluded that serum levels of amitriptyline and active metabolites must be maintained at concentrations of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for at least three weeks before a patient is considered to have failed TCA therapy.</p><p>Anticholinergic side effects (principally sedation and dry mouth) limit patient acceptance of TCAs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62488 \">table 1</a>).

Opioid analgesics appear to be effective for pain relief in patients with PHN, but are associated with a risk of physical dependence, tolerance, addiction, and overdose.

Clonidine and codeine decreased pain relative to placebo, while ibuprofen was ineffective. Clonidine provided more pain relief than codeine, although the degree of relief with either agent was modest.
