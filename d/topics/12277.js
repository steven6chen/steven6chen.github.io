Elective AAA repair prior to the development of symptoms is the most effective means to prevent rupture and aneurysm-related sudden death. </p><p>The definition of abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortic anatomy will be reviewed here together with an overview of the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, natural history, screening, clinical features and diagnosis, management, and surgical repair, with links to more detailed topics. Our recommendations for the care of the patient with AAA are consistent with those provided by the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines, which were updated in 2018 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other types of arterial aneurysms are discussed separately.

A true aneurysm is defined as a segmental, full-thickness dilation of a blood vessel that is 50 percent greater than the normal aortic diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. False aneurysms of the abdominal aorta can also occur but are much less common and are usually due to a traumatic or infectious etiology.</p><p>In most adults, an aortic diameter &gt;3.0 cm is generally considered aneurysmal. Normal aortic diameter varies with age, gender, and body habitus, but the average diameter of the adult human infrarenal aorta is approximately 2.0 cm; 95 percent of the adult population has an aortic diameter &le;3.0 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, for the majority of patients, an infrarenal aorta with a maximum diameter &ge;3.0 cm is considered aneurysmal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. For men, diameter alone defines the presence of an AAA and predicts clinical events. However, for women, although the aorta is still considered aneurysmal when its diameter exceeds 3.0 cm, the diameter is less predictive of clinical events. An aortic scaling index (ASI), calculated as diameter <span class=\"nowrap\">(cm)/body</span> surface area (m<sup>2</sup>), is more predictive of clinical events than absolute aortic diameter in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>For the purposes of this discussion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small aneurysms have a diameter &lt;4.0 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medium aneurysms have a diameter between 4.0 and 5.5 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large aneurysms have a diameter &gt;5.5 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very large aneurysms have a diameter &ge;6.0 cm</p><p/><p>The natural history of AAA is one of progressive expansion, which is variable and depends upon aneurysm diameter and other factors, the most important of which is ongoing smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>AAAs can be described relative to the involvement of the renal or visceral vessels. Several classification schemes have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

There is a segment of nonaneurysmal aorta that extends distal to the origins of the renal arteries.</p><p/><p>AAA most often affects the segment of aorta between the renal and inferior mesenteric arteries; approximately 5 percent involve the renal or visceral arteries. Up to 40 percent of AAAs are associated with iliac artery aneurysm(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3-5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,12</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45240028\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal aorta is a retroperitoneal structure that begins at the hiatus of the diaphragm and extends to its bifurcation into the right and left common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The posterior abdominal peritoneum covers the abdominal aorta anteriorly and is reflected onto the posterolateral duodenum at its junction with the jejunum.</p><p>The aorta lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava, which is adjacent to the aorta on its right. The branches of the aorta include (superior to inferior) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 4</a>) the left and right inferior phrenic arteries, left and right middle suprarenal arteries, celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries, left and right gonadal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, left and right common iliac artery, middle sacral artery, and paired lumbar arteries (L1-L4).</p><p>The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60420 \">figure 5</a>). The internal iliac artery gives rise to anterior and posterior branches to the pelvic viscera and also supplies the musculature of the pelvis. The external iliac artery passes underneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91213681\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in developed countries is between 2 and 8 percent and is higher in men (4 to 8 percent in those older than 50) compared with women (1 to 1.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Based on screening, approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States have an AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The prevalence of AAA increases with age in both men and women, although the age-related increase is more pronounced in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Ultrasound screening studies have shown that 4 to 8 percent of older men have an occult AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Because the incidence of AAA rises sharply in individuals over 60 years of age, the future prevalence of AAA could increase substantially in association with the aging population. Other studies suggest that a reduction in the prevalence of smoking may have the opposite effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>In the 2010s, death from rupture of an AAA was estimated to occur in approximately 7000 patients per year in the United States. AAA-associated mortality has decreased by nearly 50 percent since the early 1990s. Although the specific reasons for this decline are unknown, the declining prevalence of cigarette smoking in the adult population, the increasing awareness and impact of government-sponsored screening programs for identifying early disease, and an increase in the use of endovascular repair of AAA, particularly in the older patients, all may have played a role in this decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91213688\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Well-defined clinical risk factors are associated with the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These risk factors are listed below and discussed in detail elsewhere. </p><p>The risk factors associated with aneurysmal disease include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male gender </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caucasian race </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerosis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of AAA </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other large artery aneurysms (eg, iliac, femoral, popliteal)</p><p/><p>A decreased risk of AAA is associated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Caucasian race </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91213695\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aneurysmal degeneration of the abdominal aorta is a multifactorial, systemic process generally felt to be due to alterations in vascular wall biology leading to a loss of vascular structural proteins and wall strength. A common systemic etiology for large vessel (eg, aorta, femoral, iliac, popliteal) aneurysm formation is supported by the occurrence of multiple aneurysms in the same patient. Etiologic factors felt to be important in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) include proteases, inflammatory mediators, and genetic factors. Biomechanical forces, including stresses across the arterial wall, are also felt to play a role. </p><p>An understanding of the management of patients with an AAA requires knowledge of the natural history of this disorder. The natural history of AAA is one of progressive expansion, the rate of which is variable. Abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, on average, at a rate of 0.3 to 0.4 cm per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Expansion tends to be more rapid in smokers and less rapid in patients with diabetes mellitus or peripheral artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Some aneurysms, for unclear reasons, remain relatively fixed in size for a period of time but then undergo rapid expansion. </p><p>The likelihood that an aneurysm will rupture is increased for those with aneurysm diameter &gt;5.5 cm, a faster rate of expansion (&gt;0.5 cm over a six-month period), those who continue to smoke, and in females. In addition to these, other factors that increase the risk of rupture include recent surgery; medical factors such as uncontrolled hypertension, which may increase aortic wall stress; and, possibly, aneurysm contour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91213702\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening studies show that abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs in up to 7 percent of individuals over the age of 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/18,19,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,30,31</a>]. However, the majority of AAAs identified at screening are small, and up to 50 percent of those &le;3.5 cm in diameter remain stable throughout follow-up (do not enlarge significantly) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The effectiveness of population-based screening for AAAs with abdominal ultrasonography has been evaluated in large randomized trials and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/33-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-40</a>]. Screening for AAA in men over age 65 results in a decreased risk of AAA-related mortality; however, for people with a low risk for AAA, any absolute benefit on overall mortality is likely to be small. A one-time screening for AAA is recommended for men ages 65 to 75 who have smoked, and in men ages 65 to 75 who have never smoked but who have a first-degree relative who required repair of an AAA or died from a ruptured AAA. Screening for other subsets should be individualized.

A previously unknown AAA may also become apparent as a result of screening or be discovered incidentally on routine physical examination, on imaging studies performed for other indications, or in the course of evaluating other unrelated conditions. Asymptomatic AAAs are difficult to exclude based on physical examination alone in most patients, even when attempted by experienced examiners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H15830656\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic AAA'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic but not ruptured &ndash; Symptomatic AAA refers to any of a number of symptoms that can be attributed to the aneurysm. The development of symptoms may be a sign that AAA configuration is rapidly expanding, has become large enough to compress surrounding structures, or is an inflammatory or infectious aneurysm. Patients with symptomatic AAA most commonly present with abdominal, back, or flank pain, which may or may not be associated with AAA rupture. AAA can also present with other clinical manifestations, such as limb ischemia (acute or chronic), or other systemic manifestations (fever, malaise). In patients with abdominal pain, rupture of the aneurysm must be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H15830889\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic (nonruptured) AAA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic and ruptured &ndash; The clinical presentation of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is variable with respect to symptoms and time course. The patient may or may not be aware of the diagnosis of AAA prior to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> clinical manifestations of rupture. Only 20 to 30 percent of patients who present to an emergency department with rupture have a known history of AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. The classic presentation of severe pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].&nbsp;Although the signs and symptoms of ruptured AAA may be obvious, some presentations make ruptured AAA difficult to recognize. Patients with rupture into the retroperitoneum may attribute their symptoms to other causes and delay seeking medical attention. Even after presenting to a physician, a misdiagnosis of ruptured AAA as renal colic, perforated viscus, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and ischemic bowel occurs approximately 30 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Physical examination can reliably diagnose a large AAA (&gt;5.5 cm), but the diagnosis is made using abdominal palpation in fewer than 50 percent of those with AAA. The physical examination should include a complete peripheral arterial vascular examination to assess for signs of thromboembolism or other peripheral aneurysms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H15830547\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory studies are not routinely obtained as part of the evaluation of asymptomatic AAA. However, a white blood cell count, blood cultures, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate should be performed in patients with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss) to evaluate for an infectious cause of AAA or inflammatory aneurysm. For patients with ruptured AAA, standard laboratory testing and type and crossmatch are obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91213723\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal aortic aneurysm that is suspected based upon clinical symptoms or signs, or incidentally on nonvascular imaging studies (eg, spine magnetic resonance [MR] imaging), should be confirmed with definitive vascular imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86821\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86821 \">algorithm 1</a>). For asymptomatic AAA, the imaging test of choice is abdominal ultrasonography, which has sensitivity and specificity approaching 100 percent for an aortic diameter &gt;3.0 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Abdominal ultrasound is noninvasive and is ideal for serial imaging in patients with small- and medium-sized aneurysms who are being conservatively managed. However, ultrasound is technician dependent and has other limitations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H22322286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Imaging asymptomatic patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H766539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm surveillance'</a>.) </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging test of choice for symptomatic AAA. Contrast-enhanced CT aortography is generally not needed to establish a diagnosis of rAAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] but may be essential for planning surgical repair. In patients with symptoms of more than one hour, findings of rupture on CT scan are usually obvious (eg, retroperitoneal hematoma, extravasation of contrast) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72201\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72201 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Other findings on abdominal CT may be associated with unstable aneurysms or &quot;impending rupture&quot; (eg, crescent sign, breaks in aortic wall calcification, aortic blebs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>].

However, these are generally limited to preoperative planning and to postoperative follow-up of aortic graft repairs.

Endovascular repair of ruptured AAA may have some advantages over open repair; however, it is not universally available, and the selection of technique is best determined by the available surgical team. Open surgical or endovascular repair of ruptured AAA is accomplished in a manner that is similar to elective repair, with modifications for aortic hemorrhage control, and anticoagulation. Conversion rates from endovascular to open repair for rAAA may be higher compared with elective repair because of unanticipated anatomic features or device-related issues.

For patients with symptomatic AAA, the first priority is to determine whether there is any immediate concern that the aneurysm has ruptured or is at high risk for impending rupture, which may be suggested by clinical symptoms or signs, or certain radiologic features (eg, broken calcification, asymmetry) that may indicate instability of the aneurysm.

Endovascular aneurysm repair is associated with a lower risk of perioperative morbidity compared with open repair for asymptomatic, symptomatic, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Long-term mortality following elective AAA repair is not significantly different between the techniques. Guidelines from major medical and surgical societies recommend an individualized approach to the patient when choosing between open and endovascular repair, taking into account the patient's age, risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality, anatomic factors, and experience of the surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/4,5,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,58</a>]. Given the need for lifelong surveillance with endovascular repair, younger patients with low operative risk may benefit more from open surgical repair, whereas older patients and those with high operative risk may benefit more from endovascular repair, provided their aortoiliac anatomy is appropriate.
