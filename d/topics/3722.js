The clinical manifestations of arterial insufficiency (regardless of etiology) are due to a lack of blood flow to the musculature relative to its metabolism, which results in pain in the affected muscle groups. The presence of an extremity ulcer is one of the more obvious clinical signs that can be due to ischemia, but other manifestations, such as claudication and rest pain, should be actively sought out and differentiated from nonatherosclerotic and nonvascular conditions to ensure timely referral to a vascular specialist, when indicated. Ideally, a multidisciplinary approach involving the primary care provider, medical specialists, podiatrist, vascular specialist (interventionalist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgeon), and plastic surgery provides optimal medical and surgical care. PAD is a treatable condition. When recognized early and appropriately managed, complications that can lead to limb loss can be minimized. </p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity PAD are reviewed here. The epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of PAD, as well as the medical and surgical treatment of PAD are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-natural-history-of-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and natural history of peripheral artery disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of claudication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-interventional-procedures-in-the-patient-with-lower-extremity-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous interventional procedures in the patient with lower extremity claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority of patients with PAD have atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremity. Atherosclerotic PAD of the upper extremity is much less common and is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380412848\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many pathologic processes can cause arterial obstruction leading to symptoms of arterial insufficiency because of reduced blood flow. In this topic, we focus on atherosclerosis as a cause of progressive narrowing of the lower extremity arteries, or as a source of atheroembolization. </p><p>Variable terminology has been used to refer to arterial disease that is due to atherosclerosis. Older terms include arteriosclerotic disease, and peripheral artery occlusive disease. In many resources, the term peripheral artery disease (PAD) is regarded as a general term encompassing a range of noncoronary arterial syndromes caused by the altered structure and function of the aorta and peripheral arteries due to numerous pathophysiological processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. We regard the term PAD as denoting arterial disease affecting the peripheral (noncoronary) vasculature due to atherosclerosis, distinguishing PAD from other processes, which are given below and discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H1180008\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of arterial obstruction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380414296\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for PAD are similar to those that promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis.

However, if the supply of blood fails to satisfy ongoing metabolic requirements as a consequence of arterial narrowing, symptoms will occur, the severity of which depends upon the degree of arterial narrowing, number of arteries affected, and the activity level of the patients. PAD can present with pain of one or more lower extremity muscle groups related to activity (ie, intermittent claudication), atypical pain, pain at rest, or with nonhealing wounds, ulceration, or gangrene. (See <a href=\"#H498002717\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>The 2005 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on PAD suggested the following distribution of clinical presentation of PAD in patients &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic &ndash; 20 to 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical leg pain &ndash; 40 to 50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic claudication &ndash; 10 to 35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Threatened limb &ndash; 1 to 2 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498002356\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients screened for PAD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with peripheral artery disease may be diagnosed based upon screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85752\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85752 \">algorithm 1</a>). Recommendations for screening are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Screening identifies PAD by lower extremity examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of lower extremity PAD'</a> below.)</p><p>Detection of asymptomatic PAD has value because it identifies patients at increased risk of atherosclerosis at other sites. Patients with asymptomatic PAD identified on screening also benefit from medical therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, lipid lowering, blood pressure control, smoking cessation) that reduce their risk for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497999604\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent claudication and atypical lower extremity pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most symptomatic patients with PAD present with lower extremity pain, either as classic intermittent claudication or atypical leg pain. Intermittent claudication (derived from the Latin word for limp) is defined as a reproducible discomfort of a defined group of muscles that is induced by exercise and relieved with rest. Although the supply of blood may be adequate to meet the demands of inactive muscle, a mismatch develops between the supply of blood and increased demand induced by activity. This mismatch may also lead to atypical lower extremity pain. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Claudication'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Atypical extremity pain'</a> below.)</p><p>Atypical symptoms may be more common than classic claudication due to comorbidities, physical inactivity, and alterations in pain perception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. A low rate of classic claudication was noted in the report from the PARTNERS program, in which 6417 patients were at risk for PAD (either age &ge;70 or age 50 to 69 with a history of diabetes or more than 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking) in a primary care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. PAD, identified by the ABI or by history, was present in 29 percent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the patients with a new diagnosis of PAD, approximately 47 percent had no history of leg symptoms, 47 percent had atypical leg symptoms, and only 6 percent had classic claudication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the patients with known prior PAD, approximately 25 percent had no leg symptoms, 61 percent had atypical leg symptoms, and 14 percent had classic claudication.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497999598\"><span class=\"h2\">Threatened limb</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PAD can present initially with a threatened limb (critical limb ischemia). It has been estimated that 1 to 2 percent of patients with PAD who are 50 years of age or older present in this manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Limb threat is part of a broad disease spectrum, of which perfusion is one determinant of outcome. Other important factors include the extent and severity of any wounds, and the presence and severity of infection. (See <a href=\"#H497998759\" class=\"local\">'Ulceration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H497998765\" class=\"local\">'Gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p>Ischemia sufficient to threaten a limb occurs when arterial blood flow is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of resting muscle or tissue. Patients may present with varying degrees of tissue loss or frankly gangrenous digits, forefoot, or hindfoot. </p><p>According to the 2007 Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II), limb ischemia that manifests as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion presenting within two weeks of the inciting event is defined as acute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with similar manifestations who present more than two weeks later are considered to have chronic ischemia.</p><p>Although acute limb ischemia sufficient to threaten the lower extremity is more commonly due to thromboembolism (eg, atrial fibrillation), it can be due to a sudden thrombotic occlusion of a narrowed arterial segment, occlusion from atheroembolic debris shed from a more proximal location, or occlusion due to arterial dissection. In patients who have undergone prior intervention for PAD, acute limb ischemia may be due to stent or bypass graft thrombosis. Acute limb ischemia can be stratified by symptoms (eg, pain, paresthesias) and physical findings (eg, severely diminished or absent pulses, coolness), which help to determine treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75112\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75112 \">table 1</a>). The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute limb ischemia are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-lower-extremity-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic ischemia sufficient to threaten the limb is often the result of arterial stenoses or occlusions that affect more than one level of the arterial tree; however, isolated tibial vessel disease frequently threatens the viability of the lower extremity in patients with diabetes, and in the elderly. This most often involves the aortoiliac and femoropopliteal segments, or femoropopliteal and tibial segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Multiple levels of disease promote severe ischemia by reducing the effectiveness of collateral flow and by lowering distal systolic pressures that drive tissue perfusion. The major manifestations of chronic ischemia are rest pain, ischemic ulceration, and gangrene. (See <a href=\"#H498001449\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic rest pain'</a> below and <a href=\"#H497998759\" class=\"local\">'Ulceration'</a> below and <a href=\"#H497998765\" class=\"local\">'Gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482053999\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380414290\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of PAD increases progressively with age, beginning after age 40. As a result, PAD is growing as a clinical problem due to the aging population in the United States and other developed countries. As such, a standard review during the examination of older patients should always include questions related to a history of walking impairment, extremity pain that might be due to ischemia, and the presence of nonhealing wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Specific questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have any pain with ambulation? If so, how far can the patient walk before the pain occurs? Does the pain cause the patient to stop walking? If so, after how much time is the patient able to resume walking? Does the pain recur after a similar walking distance? Has the patient's ability to walk diminished over time or altered the patient's lifestyle in any way?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient experience any pain in the extremity that wakens them from sleep? If so, where is the pain located? Is the pain relieved once the foot is hung over the side of the bed? Does pain cause the patient to sleep sitting in a chair?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient noticed any nonhealing wounds or ulcers on the toes? If so, how long have the wounds or ulcers been present? If wounds have occurred in the past, what measures were used to promote healing?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient known to have PAD? If so, has the patient undergone any prior interventions to manage PAD, or other arterial disease?</p><p/><p>Patients with risk factors for PAD who report no or few symptoms should be asked about functional capacity and decline in activity over time. Several questionnaires estimating walking ability, functional capacity, and the psychosocial effects of PAD are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>]. Although useful for quantifying data and following patients participating in clinical studies, these have limited use in routine clinical practice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498002717\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497999567\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower extremity pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower extremity pain is the predominant symptom in patients with PAD and is due to varying degrees of ischemia. Patients with PAD may complain of pain in the calf, thigh, or buttock brought on with activity and relieved with rest (ie, intermittent claudication), atypical leg pain, or constant pain in the forefoot aggravated by elevation and relieved by dependency (ie, rest pain). Less commonly, patients may present with diffuse, severe lower extremity pain as a manifestation of acute extremity ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Claudication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain within a defined group of muscles that is induced by exercise and relieved with rest defines classic intermittent claudication (derived from the Latin word for limp). The severity of claudication symptoms reported by the patient depends upon the degree of stenosis, the effectiveness of collateral vascular channels, and the vigor of exercise. The perception of claudication can range from a bothersome discomfort of little consequence to a severe, debilitating pain that becomes lifestyle-limiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A classification of PAD disease severity is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia#H1576665352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia&quot;, section on 'Symptom classification'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Classic symptoms of claudication manifest as exertional leg pain that begins after a certain walking distance, causes the patient to stop walking, and resolves within 10 minutes of rest, allowing the patient to resume walking again, typically for the same distance after which the pain recurs. Claudication can present unilaterally or bilaterally, as buttock and hip, thigh, calf, or foot pain, singly or in combination. The usual relationships between pain location and corresponding anatomic site of PAD are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buttock and hip claudication &ndash; Patients with aortoiliac disease may complain of buttock, hip, and, in some cases, thigh claudication. The pain is often described as aching in nature and may be associated with weakness of the hip or thigh with walking. Pulses in one or both groins are diminished. Bilateral aortoiliac PAD that is severe enough to cause lower extremity symptoms almost always causes erectile dysfunction in men. Leriche syndrome is the triad of claudication, absent or diminished femoral pulses, and erectile dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thigh claudication &ndash; Atherosclerotic occlusion of the common femoral artery may induce claudication in the thigh, calf, or both. Patients with disease isolated to the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries have normal groin pulses but decreased pulses distally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calf claudication &ndash; Calf claudication is the most common complaint. It is usually described as escalating pain that is consistently reproduced with exercise and relieved with rest. Pain in the upper two-thirds of the calf is usually due to superficial femoral artery stenosis, whereas pain in the lower third of the calf is due to popliteal disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot claudication &ndash; Claudication of the foot is usually accompanied by occlusive disease of the tibial and peroneal vessels. Isolated foot claudication is uncommon with PAD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h4\">Atypical extremity pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients diagnosed with PAD, reports of atypical symptoms may be more common than classic claudication given comorbidities, physical inactivity, and alterations in pain perception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In patients with multiple medical comorbidities, it is sometimes difficult to separate the contributions to extremity pain by arthritis, neuropathy, spinal stenosis, fibromyalgia, statin-induced myalgia, and other entities from those of PAD. Extremity pain due to PAD has its genesis in the muscles and typical or atypical should follow an exercise-induced and rest&ndash;relieving pattern of onset and resolution with a repeatable cycle.&nbsp;Nevertheless, before attributing atypical symptoms to PAD, other lower extremity disorders must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H497998990\" class=\"local\">'Nonarterial etiologies for limb pain'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498001449\"><span class=\"h4\">Ischemic rest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A severe decrease in limb perfusion can result in ischemic rest pain due to diffuse pedal ischemia. Ischemic rest pain is typically localized in the forefoot and toes, and is not readily controlled by analgesics. Ischemic rest pain is brought on, or made worse by, elevation of the lower extremity, and is often worse when the patient reclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The pain can also be felt more proximally, but when this occurs, the pain usually does not spare the foot. Pain can be more localized in patients who develop an ischemic ulcer or gangrenous digits. (See <a href=\"#H497999831\" class=\"local\">'Nonhealing wound/ulcer'</a> below and <a href=\"#H497999912\" class=\"local\">'Skin discoloration/gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p>Affected patients frequently find that the pain is relieved by hanging their feet over the edge of the bed, or, paradoxically (in contrast to claudication), by walking around the room because of the gravitational effect of dependence on extremity perfusion. </p><p>Chronic reductions in extremity blood flow can also lead to a superimposed ischemic neuropathic pain that is frequently described as throbbing or burning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe shooting pains in the limb. In patients with diabetes, differentiating diabetic neuropathy from combined diabetic ischemic neuropathy can be difficult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497999177\"><span class=\"h4\">Severe diffuse pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse acute limb ischemia is characterized by the sudden onset of extremity pain progressing to numbness and finally paralysis of the extremity, accompanied by pallor, paresthesias, coolness, and absence of palpable pulses. In patients with PAD, diffuse ischemia can be due to atheroembolism, thrombotic occlusion of a stenotic artery, or thrombosis of a vascular prior stent or vascular reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497999831\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonhealing wound/ulcer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic ulcers often begin as minor traumatic wounds and then fail to heal because the blood supply is insufficient to meet the increased demands of the healing tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101203 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ischemic ulcers, which most often involve the foot, can become infected and may lead to osteomyelitis. In patients who are bedbound, lower extremity pressure ulcers can develop, and fail to heal with standard therapies. In patients with diabetes, nonhealing ulcers can develop over points of bony pressure. The general assessment of wounds and special considerations for pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Patients may notice focal areas of discoloration or skin color changes when their foot is elevated (pale or white) or lowered (redness). If the blood supply falls below what is necessary to meet minimal metabolic requirements, focal areas of ischemia that begin as skin discoloration can progress to full-thickness skin necrosis, which can progress into the deeper tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101202 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>The blue toe syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58761 \">picture 3</a>), usually due to embolic occlusion of digital arteries with atheroembolic material from a proximal arterial source, may progress to a nonhealing ulcer or focal areas of gangrene if severe PAD is present.

(See <a href=\"#H380414296\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The patient's vital signs should be recorded and abnormalities noted. The patient's temperature and blood pressure in each upper extremity should be documented and the higher of the two noted for ankle-brachial index calculation. Fever may indicate the presence of an infected ulcer, and the presence of tachycardia and tachypnea may support the diagnosis of a deep space infection of the foot that may not be readily apparent on physical examination. </p><p>The vascular examination is best performed with the patient supine on the examination table and should be performed only after the patient has rested for at least 15 minutes, and has warmed up if coming indoors from cold weather. Patients with advanced ischemia who do not tolerate having their feet elevated can be briefly placed supine to examine the abdomen and femoral vessels, and thereafter seated upright to perform the remainder of the examination. The examination should include inspection of the skin of the extremities, examination of the abdomen, palpation of all peripheral pulses, auscultation for bruits, and extremity neurologic examination. </p><p>The vascular examination in patients with PAD commonly reveals diminished or absent pulses below the level of arterial stenosis with occasional bruits over stenotic lesions and evidence of poor wound healing in the area of diminished perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Other physical findings may include an abnormal body habitus, skin color and nail changes, and abnormal venous filling time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

With significantly diminished blood flow, the skin becomes thin with functional loss of the dermal appendages, which is evident as dry, shiny, and hairless skin. However, one study found that a lack of lower extremity hair is not a predictor of PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The nails may become brittle, hypertrophic and ridged. Comparison of color and trophic changes between extremities can give a good indication of the severity of PAD unless bilateral disease is present, in which case the appearance of the extremities may approximate each other, and experience of the examiner is required to judge the severity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497998747\"><span class=\"h4\">Skin temperature and color</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The color of the skin is produced by blood in the subpapillary layer and varies with temperature of the skin, position of the extremity, and degree of blood oxygenation (reduced hemoglobin appears blue). </p><p>Skin temperature is an indicator of the blood flow rate in the dermal vessels, though flow is governed primarily by constriction or dilation of the arterioles to maintain a constant core temperature. The temperature of the skin as a marker of perfusion is useful and can be assessed by lightly palpating the skin with the back of the hand and comparing similar sites from one extremity to the other. An ischemic limb is cool, and demarcation of temperature gives a rough indication of the level of the occlusion. Assessment of temperature differences is confounded when both extremities are affected.</p><p>The Buerger test involves first elevating the foot with the patient in the supine position and waiting until the veins have completely drained, and then placing the foot in a dependent position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Elevation of the extremity above the level of the central venous pressure (rarely greater than 25 cm) permits the pooled venous blood to drain, allowing an accurate assessment of the degree of arterial flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The time of return of blood to the dependent extremity is a useful marker of the severity of disease (normally &lt;20 sec). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal extremity will remain pink with elevation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with significant PAD will have foot pallor with elevation and, in the dependent position, a dusky flush will occur spreading proximally from the toes. The color can be rubrous or cyanotic depending on skin temperature. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic arterial occlusion, the arterioles are maximally dilated as a compensatory response to the chronic ischemia, which intensifies skin color changes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to differentiate the rubor associated with arterial insufficiency from cellulitis accompanying an infective process. A red, cellulitic appearance will persist despite extremity elevation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute arterial occlusion, the venules empty, leading to a chalky white skin appearance regardless of extremity position. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497998759\"><span class=\"h4\">Ulceration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extremity ulcerations have a characteristic appearance depending upon their origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63577\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63577 \">table 2</a>). Ulcerations caused by ischemia are typically located at the termination of arterial branches. They are commonly found on the tips of the toes and between the digits. Ischemic ulcers also form at sites of increased focal pressure, such as the lateral malleolus and metatarsal heads. The lesions often appear dry and punched out, are painful, but exhibit little bleeding. Ischemic ulcers are usually associated with the other clinical features of chronic ischemia, including pallor, hair loss, and nail changes, as discussed above. </p><p>Some patients have combined arterial and venous disease and manifest signs of both arterial and venous insufficiency, including ulcers with a mixed etiology. Similarly, patients with diabetes can have arterial disease and peripheral neuropathy, each of which can contribute to ulcer formation. (See <a href=\"#H1179789\" class=\"local\">'Nonarterial etiologies for ulceration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497998765\"><span class=\"h4\">Gangrene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to ulcers, patients can have a frankly gangrenous digit(s), forefoot, or hindfoot. Gangrene can be described as either dry or wet. Dry gangrene is characterized by a hard, dry texture, usually occurring in the distal aspects of toes and fingers, often with a clear demarcation between viable and black, necrotic tissue. This form of gangrene is common in patients with PAD. Wet gangrene is characterized by its moist appearance, gross swelling, and blistering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Wet gangrene represents a surgical emergency, and appropriate consultation should be made when identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380415680\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of pulses of the patient with suspected PAD should include palpation of the brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries. The normal popliteal artery is often unable to be easily palpated but can usually be identified with Doppler. Assessment for bruits with a stethoscope should also be undertaken over the iliac arteries. The inability to easily palpate a given vessel should lead to interrogation with a handheld continuous wave Doppler ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58549051\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Continuous wave Doppler'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497998203\"><span class=\"h4\">Bedside ABI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The resting ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) is a simple test that can be performed at the bedside, and should be measured in patients with one or more findings consistent with PAD on the review of symptoms or other findings on physical exam. The ABI is the ratio of the ankle systolic blood pressure divided by the brachial systolic pressure detected with a Doppler probe. In patients with no or mild to moderate symptoms, ABI of &lt;0.90 has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for PAD, using arteriography as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Techniques for performing the ABI are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H89024919\" class=\"local\">'Site and severity of PAD'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H410475603\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower extremity neurologic examination is important and should include motor and sensory testing. In the patient with acute limb ischemia, sensory loss and progressive lower extremity motor loss are ominous signs indicating the need for prompt intervention. Patients with acute arterial or graft thrombosis superimposed upon chronic ischemia may be more tolerant depending on the effectiveness of collateral vessels. </p><p>Chronic ischemia can cause varying patterns of sensory loss, progressing from distal to proximal as the severity of ischemia worsens. Diabetic patients may have a superimposed sensory neuropathy, which is typically in a glove-and-stocking distribution and reduced vibration sense and two-point discrimination. The use of monofilament gauges (Semmel-Weinstein) is a good objective way to assess for diabetic neuropathy.

Patients are younger than the typical patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, and are heavy smokers. Digit ischemia is the most common presentation, and although larger artery involvement is uncommon, claudication can occur but is nearly always associated with signs of distal ischemia.

In endurance athletes, especially cyclists, an even more unusual cause of claudication is due to repeated trauma (stretching or kinking) of the external iliac artery, which can result in endofibrosis of the vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Arterial causes are discussed in the preceding section. Nonarterial pathologic conditions should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of limb pain. The major clinical features that distinguish these disorders from arterial claudication are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50130 \">table 4</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic pain is predominantly due to neurospinal (eg, disc disease, spinal stenosis, tumor) or neuropathic causes (eg, diabetes, alcohol abuse). Neurogenic claudication, also called &quot;spinal claudication&quot; or &quot;pseudoclaudication&quot;, describes a pain syndrome due to lumbar neurospinal canal compression, which is usually due to osteophytic narrowing of the neurospinal canal. The clinical presentation often helps to distinguish vasculogenic (ie, true) claudication from pseudoclaudication. Unlike true claudication, which occurs with walking and is relieved by stopping, pseudoclaudication causes pain with erect posture (lumbar lordosis) and is relieved by sitting or lying down. Symptoms in patients with pseudoclaudication may also be relieved by leaning forward and straightening the spine (usually done with pushing a shopping cart or leaning against a wall).

As a result, PAD is growing as a clinical problem due to the aging population in the United States and other developed countries. Risk factors for PAD are similar to those that promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis (ie, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes). (See <a href=\"#H380414296\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A standard review during the examination of older patients should always include questions related to a history of walking impairment, extremity pain that might be due to ischemia, and the presence of nonhealing wounds. Patients with risk factors for PAD who report no or few symptoms should be asked about functional capacity and decline in activity over time. (See <a href=\"#H380414290\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with compromised blood flow to the extremities as a consequence of arterial stenosis due to PAD may present with pain of one or more muscle groups, atypical pain, or no symptoms. Intermittent claudication (derived from the Latin word for limp) is defined as a reproducible discomfort of a defined group of muscles that is induced by exercise and relieved with rest. This disorder results from an imbalance between supply and demand of blood flow that fails to satisfy ongoing metabolic requirements. (See <a href=\"#H482053642\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic claudication is characterized by leg pain that is consistently reproduced with exercise and relieved with rest. The degree of symptoms of claudication depends upon the severity of stenosis, the collateral circulation, and the vigor of exercise. Patients with claudication can present with buttock, hip, thigh, calf, or foot pain, alone or in combination. The usual relationships between pain location and corresponding anatomic site of arterial occlusive disease can be summarized as follows: (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Claudication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Buttock and hip: Aortoiliac disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thigh: Aortoiliac or common femoral artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Upper two-thirds of the calf: Superficial femoral artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lower one-third of the calf: Popliteal artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Foot claudication: Tibial or peroneal artery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe decreases in limb perfusion can result in ischemic rest pain which involves the digits and forefoot and typically occurs at night. The pain may be more localized in patients who develop an ischemic ulcer or gangrenous toe. The pain may be relieved by dependent positioning of the foot. (See <a href=\"#H498001449\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic rest pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with PAD have atypical symptoms as a result of comorbidities, physical inactivity, and alterations in pain perception. Compared with patients with classic claudication, those with leg pain on exertion and at rest are more likely to have diabetes, neuropathy, or spinal stenosis in addition to PAD. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Atypical extremity pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To confirm the diagnosis of arterial stenosis or occlusion, which is most commonly due to PAD, the resting ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (ABI) should be performed in patients with lower extremity exertional symptoms and in those patients with risk factors for PAD. An ABI of &le;0.90 has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for a diagnosis of PAD. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of lower extremity PAD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any process that leads to arterial stenosis or occlusion can cause symptoms of lower extremity ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75390 \">table 3</a>). These include arterial aneurysm, arterial dissection, and arterial embolism, among others. Nonarterial pathologic conditions should also be considered, including neurological disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and acute and chronic venous disease such as deep vein thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome. The presenting clinical features should help distinguish atypical symptoms of PAD from other causes of extremity pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50130 \">table 4</a>).
