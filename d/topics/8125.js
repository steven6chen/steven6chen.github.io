Essential components in determining if a patient is a candidate for resection involve considering the following factors:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3699172757\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver resection subjects patients to substantial physiologic stress. In patients with significant medical comorbidities (eg, significant underlying liver disease, extensive cardiopulmonary disease, advanced age), although a CRLM may be resectable, the perioperative risks may be prohibitive. Preoperative risk assessment is critical prior to surgery, as is allowing sufficient time for medical optimization. The details of risk assessment are discussed in other topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing surgical risk in patients with liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3933998624\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor biology is one of the most important factors that predict recurrence and survival. Prognostic tools based on clinicopathologic features have been developed to determine the risk of recurrence after resection, help guide whether surgery is an appropriate treatment, and determine if the patient might benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. This is imperative in the modern era, in which patients typically receive chemotherapy before <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after resection.</p><p>Four separate clinical risk scores are currently in use to stratify patients based on their likelihood of recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116620 \">table 1</a>). High-risk patients may be considered for initial chemotherapy in order to assess the biology of the tumor prior to resection (ie, patients who develop rapidly progressive metastases beyond the liver during this trial period will have been spared an unnecessary operation). In one study, in patients who did not receive initial chemotherapy prior to resection, all but the Konopke score correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS), but only the Nagashima score was predictive of overall survival (OS). Among patients who received chemotherapy followed by resection, all but the Konopke score were predictive of DFS and OS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Unfortunately, none of the scoring systems are able to predict disease-specific survival, particularly beyond five years. In clinical practice, these instruments are most often used to discuss outcomes and decision making when planning therapy with patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>The embryonic origin of the primary colon cancer also appears to affect the prognosis of patients who develop liver metastases. In a study of 727 patients who underwent chemotherapy followed by resection, CRLMs from midgut origin (ie, right colon tumors) were associated with worse pathologic response to chemotherapy and worse survival after resection compared with CRLMs from hindgut origin (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">left/sigmoid</span> colon tumors). This effect was independent of the <em>RAS</em> mutation status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The adverse impact of right- versus left-sided primary tumor location has been noted in other colorectal cancer (CRC) populations, including those with unresectable metastatic disease and localized nonmetastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer#H388848190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and prognostic determinants of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Tumor location'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H679705865\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While previous guidelines for resection of CRLMs placed limits based on the number of lesions, tumor size, and margins, modern multidisciplinary consensus defines resectable CRC liver metastases simply as tumors that can be resected completely, while leaving an adequate liver remnant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52622 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In other words, if resection can be accomplished to achieve a R0 resection and maintain a functional residual liver volume, other negative prognostic factors should not preclude surgery.

Outcomes are more favorable when nodal involvement is limited to the porta hepatis nodes, as opposed to the common hepatic artery or paraaortic nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H389165632\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1606159391\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative imaging is used to determine the number and extent of liver metastases as well as their anatomic distribution to aid in surgical planning. It should also be used to identify extrahepatic disease spread. Either high-quality contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used. In our practice, we prefer MRI because it is most sensitive in detecting additional lesions that might preclude resection. However, availability and the expertise of both the radiologist and surgeon in interpreting the findings should dictate local practices.

CT is readily available at most centers with a relatively low cost. Despite the widespread use of CT, it is limited in the ability to identify lesions smaller than 1 cm and can have false negative rates as high as 10 percent. Furthermore, CT has low sensitivity in detecting extrahepatic metastases, such as those on serosal surfaces of both the liver and peritoneum and within the porta hepatis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>CT can be used to estimate liver volume prior to resection. This is particularly important in patients undergoing portal vein embolization in order to increase the future liver remnant volume.

Compared with CT, contrast-enhanced MRI is better at detecting subcentimeter lesions and CRLMs in patients with hepatic steatosis, a common occurrence after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Patients whose disease progresses while on chemotherapy or who develop extrahepatic disease have biologically aggressive tumors that would not benefit from resection. (See <a href=\"#H4007691482\" class=\"local\">'Synchronous colorectal liver metastases'</a> below.)</p><p>Neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy also has the potential to convert some patients with initially unresectable large or critically located liver metastases to resectable disease, although the true frequency with which this occurs is probably low.

Utilizing the liver-first approach can delay resection of the primary and increase the risk of developing complications related to the primary colorectal tumor.

Complete resection of such extensive CRLMs often requires an anatomic resection combined with multiple partial hepatectomies. This typically cannot be accomplished in a single operation because of a high risk of liver failure. With the classic approach, at the time of colorectal primary resection, the CRLMs on the future liver remnant are resected with partial hepatectomies, leaving tumors behind on the portion of the liver that can be treated with a future anatomic resection. The patient then undergoes embolization of the portal vein on the side with the remaining tumors. After an adequate hypertrophy of the future liver remnant, a formal anatomic resection of the remaining diseases can be performed as the second-stage operation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116621 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some patients who are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy may benefit from a two-staged liver-first approach. In one example, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bulky tumor, or extensive nodal disease) may benefit from intensification of preoperative therapy using induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy instead of chemoradiotherapy alone. If such patients have synchronous, potentially resectable liver metastases, they would be candidates for the reverse (liver-first), two-staged approach to resection: after four months of induction chemotherapy, hepatic resection typically takes place first; colorectal resection then follows in another two to four months upon completion of two additional months of chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy to enhance local control (minimize the risk of a positive margin). Further delaying hepatic resection until a simultaneous resection can be carried out (at six to eight months) may worsen chemotherapy-induced liver changes and increase the risk of postoperative liver failure.

Intravenous fluids are minimized, and low central venous pressure is maintained until parenchymal transection is complete in order to minimize blood loss. Once the hepatic resection is completed, the patient can be hydrated and colorectal resection performed. After colorectal resection, the liver should be reexamined for bile leak and hemostasis. The details of liver parenchymal transection techniques can be found elsewhere.

Therefore, they argue liver resection should precede colorectal primary tumor resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-for-colorectal-cancer-liver-metastasis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Furthermore, significant postoperative complications with a colorectal-first surgery can preclude both resection of the CRLM and systemic chemotherapy, which can also result in CRLM progression.</p><p>The liver-first approach terminology is misleading as patients typically receive neoadjuvant therapy before surgery.

Survival after resection has doubled, reaching almost 60 percent in the modern era. Perioperative mortality is typically &lt;5 percent, and &lt;1 percent in high-volume centers. (See <a href=\"#H117807013\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1988811045\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative planning should be based on maintaining inflow (hepatic artery and portal vein), outflow (hepatic veins), biliary drainage, and adequate future liver reserve to prevent post-hepatectomy liver failure. Anatomically speaking, if a R0 resection can be accomplished and a functional residual liver volume preserved, other negative prognostic factors should not preclude surgery. However, patient-related factors (eg, comorbidities) can prohibit surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4160085102\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either high-quality computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine the quantity and location of CRLMs and their resectability. The quality of the liver should also be assessed as preoperative chemotherapy can cause liver injury. In general, a healthy liver requires a future liver remnant volume of &gt;20 percent, and &gt;30 percent is needed for livers that have undergone chemotherapy-associated changes. (See <a href=\"#H389165632\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2683924912\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy-related liver toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical risk scores can be used to counsel patients by determining the risk of recurrence and overall survival. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is one of the strongest predictors of long-term survival and recurrence. Morphologic changes in response to chemotherapy rather than size can provide prognostic data. (See <a href=\"#H3933998624\" class=\"local\">'Tumor factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H455837702\" class=\"local\">'Morphologic response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRLMs smaller than 2 cm and &gt;1 cm deep in the liver are at greatest risk of disappearing (radiographically) after systemic chemotherapy. They should still be resected because complete pathologic response is rare. Fiducial placement prior to systemic therapy can facilitate identification of these lesions at the time of resection. (See <a href=\"#H2655315127\" class=\"local\">'Fiducial placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with synchronous CRLMs, there are no differences in oncologic outcomes between simultaneous, classic (colorectal-first), or reverse (liver-first) approaches to surgical resection. The timing and sequence of resections mostly depend on the acuity of symptoms and disease burden (see <a href=\"#H1549881577\" class=\"local\">'Selecting a surgical approach'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who present with symptoms from the primary colorectal cancer (CRC), such as bleeding, obstruction, or perforation, should undergo resection of the colorectal primary tumor first. Following postoperative recovery and two to three months of systemic chemotherapy, resection of the CRLMs is performed if there is no disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H1568543507\" class=\"local\">'Classic (colorectal-first) approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with extensive bilobar diseases would benefit from the classic (colorectal-first), two-staged approach: at the time of colorectal primary resection, some CRLMs are resected with partial hepatectomies, leaving tumors behind on the portion of the liver that will be treated with a future anatomic resection. The patient then undergoes embolization of the portal vein on the side with the remaining tumors. After an adequate increase in the future liver remnant, a formal anatomic resection of the remaining diseases can be performed at the second-stage operation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116621 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a colorectal primary lesion in a favorable location (eg, right colon) and limited liver metastases may undergo simultaneous resection. Simultaneous resection should be used cautiously when both the liver and colorectal tumors require an extensive resection. When simultaneous resection is performed, the liver resection is performed first. If the hepatic resection is more extensive than anticipated, or there is greater blood loss than anticipated, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient is not tolerating the procedure, the colorectal portion should be postponed and a staged approach utilized. (See <a href=\"#H4263387516\" class=\"local\">'Simultaneous resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal-sparing resections achieve similar oncologic outcomes to those of anatomic resections while preserving greater hepatic reserve, which potentially increases salvageability in case of hepatic recurrence. While still debated, current trends are moving toward nonanatomic parenchymal-sparing resections for CRLMs. (See <a href=\"#H2609690523\" class=\"local\">'Parenchymal-sparing versus anatomic resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of CRLM resection should be to obtain negative margins. When anatomically feasible, we suggest obtaining resection margins of &gt;10 mm (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, resection should still be offered if a minimal margin of &gt;1 mm can be achieved. Every effort should be made to achieve a negative initial margin, as intraoperative reresection of the margin based on frozen section results has not been associated with the same survival advantage as the initial margin. (See <a href=\"#H3848958578\" class=\"local\">'Wide versus narrow margin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2647232504\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative reresection to obtain negative margins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special consideration should be given to patients with <em>RAS</em>-mutated tumors as they have poorer survival and more positive margins when using standard surgical techniques. Wider negative margins (eg, &gt;1 cm) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anatomic resection may benefit this population, although narrow margins are likely reflective of aggressive tumor biology rather than poor technique. (See <a href=\"#H509107159\" class=\"local\">'RAS mutational status'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1547095923\" class=\"local\">'RAS mutation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We routinely perform an air cholangiogram after anatomic or multiple nonanatomic liver resections to minimize the risk of bile leak. We do not routinely place abdominal drains intraoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H2519649444\" class=\"local\">'Air cholangiogram'</a> above and <a href=\"#H874591887\" class=\"local\">'Drains'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRLM recurrence after resection is common, and reresection is a safe and feasible option in properly selected patients with adequate future liver reserve and good performance status.
