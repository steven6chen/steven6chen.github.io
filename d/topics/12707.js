Great strides have been achieved in infertility therapy, particularly the development of assisted reproductive technology (ART).</p><p>Once the cause of infertility is identified, therapy aimed at correcting reversible etiologies and overcoming irreversible factors can be implemented. The couple is also counseled on lifestyle modifications to improve fertility, such as smoking cessation, reducing excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, and appropriate frequency of coitus (every one to two days around the expected time of ovulation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73570 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optimizing natural fertility in couples planning pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The patient should be involved in fertility treatment choices. These choices involve four major factors: effectiveness (eg, live birth rate), burden of treatment (eg, frequency of injections and office visits), safety (eg, risk of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple gestation), and financial costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the treatment of female. The evaluation of female infertility, as well as the causes and treatment of male infertility, are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1743822359\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only absolute contraindications to infertility therapy are contraindication to pregnancy and contraindication to use of the drugs used to enhance fertility. The ethics of restricting infertility therapy for other reasons, such as parental child-rearing ability, severe obesity, lifestyle issues (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption), are controversial and beyond the scope of this review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Women with primary gonadal failure (previously called premature ovarian failure) or gonadal dysgenesis, comprise the majority of these cases.</p><p/><p>Hyperprolactinemic anovulation is a separate category; gonadotropin concentrations in this condition are usually normal or decreased.</p><p>Oligoovulation unrelated to ovarian failure can usually be treated successfully with ovulation induction; these women achieve fecundability nearly equivalent to that of normal couples (ie, 15 to 25 percent probability of achieving a pregnancy in one menstrual cycle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, normal fecundability is achieved at the expense of an increased risk of multiple pregnancy.</p><p>The method of ovulation induction selected should be based upon the underlying cause of anovulation and the efficacy, costs, risks, and potential complications associated with each method as they apply to the individual woman.

WHO class 1 patients respond best to therapy involving lifestyle modification or gonadotropins. Some WHO class 3 patients respond to gonadotropin therapy and in vitro fertilization (IVF), but those who fail require oocyte donation. A synopsis of these therapies is reviewed below; recommendations regarding the choice and dosing of first-line, second-line, and further therapy for ovulation induction according to WHO class are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight modulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are far above or below ideal body weight are prone to ovulatory dysfunction and subfertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Weight modulation in these women can enhance fertility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">High body weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with elevated baseline weight or body mass index (BMI) greater than 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2</span> and anovulatory infertility are advised to lose weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63600%7EENDO%2F74762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63600 graphicRef74762 \">table 3A-B</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). For obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the loss of just 5 to 10 percent of body weight is sufficient to restore ovulation in 55 to 100 percent of these women within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Weight loss is an inexpensive, low-intervention modality with no side effects and with other health benefits and thus should be a first-line treatment for obese anovulatory women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56718 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A large, multicenter trial of obese (BMI &ge;29 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and infertile women reported no difference in rates of vaginally delivered term singletons at 24 months among women who received a six-month structured weight-loss intervention prior to infertility treatment and control women who went directly to infertility treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the trial, women who underwent a six-month lifestyle intervention to lose weight prior to fertility treatment were more likely to conceive spontaneously compared with control women (26 versus 16 percent). The women in the intervention groups also underwent fewer fertility treatment cycles compared with the control women (679 versus 1067 treatment cycles). However, weight reduction was not associated with increased fecundability, as the overall term singleton vaginal birth rates and live birth rates were the same between groups. In addition, there were no differences in the obstetric outcomes of gestational diabetes or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between intervention and control groups. Study limitations include that target weight loss was reached by only 38 percent of women in the intervention group and the intervention discontinuation rate was 22 percent. It is not known if greater weight reduction per person, increased proportion of women reaching target weight loss, or increased patient continuation rates would increase fecundability. However, we continue to advise weight loss for infertile women with an elevated BMI because weight reduction appears to aid spontaneous conception and reduce the need for fertility treatment, in addition to providing long-term benefits for overall health.

Psychogenic stress may also disrupt the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator and impair ovarian function as a result of reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. Such women should be advised to gain weight, modify diet, and reduce exercise; however, these women are often reluctant to alter their behaviors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of modifying suboptimal behavior was underscored in a randomized trial of women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These women were randomly assigned to either observation or 16 sessions of intrapersonal therapy that assessed eating behavior, nutritional intake, energy expenditure, exercise, and attitudes. The goal of therapy was to correct nutritional deficiencies, energy deficit, and problematic attitudes. Treatment was effective: ovarian function recovered in 87 percent of women who received therapy, but in only 25 percent of women who did not receive the intervention. However, as discussed above, women with eating disorders, other psychiatric conditions, or compulsion to excessive exercise are often unable to change these behaviors after just a brief exposure to counseling.</p><p>Patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to eating disorders or intensive exercise who do not respond to behavioral modification may conceive with pulsatile GnRH therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Pulsatile GnRH therapy for ovulation induction has been approved by the FDA, but no pharmaceutical company makes it available in the United States at this time. This treatment is available in Europe.

Advantages of these agents over clomiphene include (1) production of fewer follicles and lower estradiol levels, thereby decreasing the risk of multiple gestation, and (2) shorter half-life (50 hours versus 5 days), resulting in reduced antiestrogen effects on the endometrium and cervical mucus. In patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a multicenter randomized double-blind trial showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> was superior to clomiphene in inducing ovulation and live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

A consensus group has recommended against the routine use of metformin for ovulation induction except in women with glucose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The improvement in pregnancy and live birth rates is likely due to the removal of a source of embryotoxic substances or fluid into the uterus disrupting implantation. It has been hypothesized that the surgical removal of hydrosalpinges might decrease blood supply to the ovaries and compromise ovarian reserve, but this has not been studied. In a meta-analysis of seven trials, proximal tubal occlusion and salpingectomy each resulted in increased rates of ongoing pregnancy following IVF in women with hydrosalpinges (tubal occlusion risk ratio 3.22, 95% CI 1.27-8.14 and salpingectomy risk ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.27-3.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although tubal occlusion resulted in more ongoing pregnancies compared with salpingectomy, the small number of trials and procedures limits the ability to determine procedure superiority. Further investigation is required to assess whether alternative surgical treatments for hydrosalpinx removal (salpingostomy, tubal occlusion, needle drainage of hydrosalpinx at oocyte retrieval) are more effective than salpingectomy.

We generally use this step-wise approach, except in the setting of multiple infertility factors (eg, significant male factor component, decreased ovarian reserve, pelvic factors) because the presence of multiple factors has a large negative effect on conservative therapy. For these cases, we would probably go straight to IVF rather than apply less resource intensive approaches. A treatment algorithm for infertile patients with early and advanced stage endometriosis is provided separately.

However, when a submucous fibroid, endometrial polyp, septate uterus, or uterine synechiae are discovered in the setting of failure to conceive or recurrent pregnancy loss, surgical correction should be considered since there may be a causal association.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between leiomyomas and infertility is controversial. Couples should complete a full infertility evaluation before addressing the role of leiomyomas in their infertility. In general, the best candidates for myomectomy are women with a submucosal fibroid or an intramural fibroid that deforms the uterine cavity.

While there is no randomized controlled trial comparing pregnancy outcomes between treated and untreated patients, two retrospective series showed a marked reduction in pregnancy loss after resection of a uterine septum or lysis of adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

This was illustrated in a trial that randomly assigned subfertile women with an endometrial polyp to hysteroscopic polypectomy before IUI or IUI alone and found removal of the polyp significantly improved the pregnancy rate (pregnancy rate 63 percent after polypectomy versus 28 percent with IUI alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Based on this trial, and other data from observational studies, we remove endometrial polyps in infertile women, even in the absence of abnormal bleeding.

In the past, it has been defined as a lag in endometrial epithelial maturation as determined by histological analysis of a timed luteal endometrial biopsy. However, there is good evidence that this is not a valid concept because fertile women have a higher prevalence of abnormal endometrial maturation than infertile women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], thus calling into question the association between luteal phase defect and infertility. A 2015 committee opinion by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine concluded that luteal phase defect as an independent entity that results in infertility has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss#H320926221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;, section on 'Luteal phase defect'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians treating women with infertility should avoid making the diagnosis of luteal phase defect until the definition and diagnosis are clarified through further research. Persistent defects of follicular and luteal function that impact fertility are most common in women with oligomenorrhea (cycle length &gt;35 days). Treatment of infertility in these women is best approached by treatment of oligomenorrhea with agents that induce ovulation, rather than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a>.

A Cochrane review of randomized and controlled trials found IUI was no more effective than timed intercourse for treatment of subfertility attributed to abnormal cervical mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatments-for-female-infertility/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Subfertility was defined as failure to conceive within one year and cervical mucus abnormality was based upon postcoital testing. The lack of benefit of IUI may be related, at least in part, to the poor prognostic value of postcoital tests for identifying women with abnormal cervical factors.
