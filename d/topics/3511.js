There are several theories regarding the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), none of which have been conclusively established. CU is a self-limited disorder in most patients, although the average duration of disease is two to five years.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, epidemiology, diagnosis, theories of pathogenesis, and natural history of CU will be reviewed here. The management of CU is discussed separately.

There are several closely related terms that are used in the CU literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2560198500\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic idiopathic urticaria and chronic spontaneous urticaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;chronic urticaria&quot; (CU), &quot;chronic idiopathic urticaria&quot; (CIU), and &quot;chronic spontaneous urticaria&quot; (CSU) are used interchangeably in this review. CU is the most general term and is used less in the literature over time because it is nonspecific and would often be used to describe patients with a mixture of CIU and physical urticaria (ie, hives triggered by physical stimuli, such as heat, cold, pressure applied to the skin, exercise, water, vibration, and sunlight). Physical urticaria is also called &quot;inducible urticaria.&quot; Physical urticaria syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term CSU is increasingly used instead of CIU or CU. This term refers to CU in which appearance of lesions is not triggered by consistent or identifiable factors, and it specifically excludes the physical urticaria syndromes or other inducible forms of urticaria. We prefer this term over the others, although it is not as familiar to nonspecialists, so we continue to use the generic term CU.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067374353\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic autoimmune urticaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies distinguish between patients with and without positive autologous serum skin tests (ASSTs) or other laboratory indicators of an autoimmune process. This distinction is mentioned in the text only if a study found a difference between these two patient groups. The performance and interpretation of an ASST is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune theory'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1183511\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At any given time, CU affects up to 1 percent of the general population in the United States, and the prevalence is believed to be similar in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Both children and adults can develop CU, although it is more common in adults. Women are affected twice as often as men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/7,9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-15</a>], and the condition typically begins in the third to fifth decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/7,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1263753\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of CU may be limited to the skin, although some patients report accompanying systemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177773262\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticarial lesions (ie, hives) are circumscribed, raised, erythematous plaques, often with central pallor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F89752\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89752 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72519 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63644\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63644 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81678\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81678 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77506 \">picture 5</a>). They may be round, annular, or serpiginous and variable in size. The lesions may appear flattened if the patient is currently taking H1 antihistamines. Individual lesions are transient, lasting a few hours to one day and resolving without residual marks. Patients with intense pruritus may occasionally injure their skin by scratching, resulting in excoriations (superficial erosions and crusts).</p><p>Lesions are extremely pruritic, and pruritus may be severe enough to disrupt work, school, or sleep. The pruritus of CU is often most noticeable at night. Any area of the body may be affected. Areas in which clothing compresses the skin (ie, under waistbands) or the skin rubs together (axillae) are sometimes affected more extensively. Patients whose symptoms have resolved sometimes have difficulty describing urticarial lesions in a sufficiently detailed manner to assist in diagnosis. In this situation, showing patients photographs of urticaria and asking if the lesions looked similar can be helpful.</p><p>Individual lesions usually appear, possibly enlarge or merge, and then resolve within 24 hours. If the patient is having difficulty estimating how long an individual lesion lasts, they can trace a newly developed lesion with a pen and monitor the time to resolution. Lesions lasting longer than 24 hours and those that are painful or burning in nature or leave residual bruising are suggestive of a vasculitic process. (See <a href=\"#H1264349\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Angioedema, if present, is defined as episodic submucosal or subcutaneous swelling that is usually asymmetric in distribution, affects nondependent parts of the body, develops over minutes to hours, and is nonpitting. Affected areas typically feel numb or tingling, rather than pruritic. Angioedema in the setting of CU commonly involves the lips, cheeks, periorbital areas of the face, extremities, and genitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are no known tests that distinguish among patients with isolated urticaria, mixed urticaria and angioedema, and predominant angioedema with infrequent urticaria.</p><p>In contrast, angioedema involving the throat, tongue, or lips, <strong>without</strong> urticaria, should prompt consideration of drug-induced angioedema (such as that seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), hereditary angioedema, or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. Episodic abdominal pain due to angioedema of the intestinal mucosa is another distinguishing feature of these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ace-inhibitor-induced-angioedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2408723869\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subset of patients with CU report systemic symptoms, including headache, fatigue, pain or swelling of joints, wheezing, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and palpitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In a study of 155 CU patients treated at a university allergy clinic, 103 reported systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This subgroup had more severe and longer-lasting disease and significantly higher baseline tryptase levels, compared with CU patients without systemic symptoms (5.1 versus 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> respectively). Although there was likely some referral bias in this study toward patients with more severe disease, clinicians should inquire about systemic symptoms in patients with CU.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94602611\"><span class=\"h2\">Aggravating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not the sole cause of symptoms, certain factors aggravate CU in a substantial subset of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98751 \">table 1</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical factors &ndash; Some patients with CU have some flares that are triggered by physical stimuli. As an example, heat (hot showers, extreme humidity) is a common trigger for many CU patients, and tight clothing or straps can also aggravate symptoms. In contrast, patients in whom physical factors are the <strong>main</strong> trigger for symptoms are more appropriately diagnosed as having a physical urticarial syndrome, such as cholinergic urticaria or delayed-pressure urticaria. Physical urticarias are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-inflammatory medications &ndash; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen symptoms in 25 to 50 percent of patients with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress &ndash; Patients often report more severe symptoms during periods of physical or psychologic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]. However, evidence that psychosocial factors are in some way causative is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variations in dietary habits and alcohol &ndash; Although food allergy is a rare cause of CU, some patients will report that variations in diet, particularly rich meals or spicy foods, will aggravate symptoms. Alcohol also aggravates symptoms in some. The interactions between diet and CU are discussed separately.

In the largest study, the prevalence of autoimmune disorders in nearly 13,000 patients with CU was compared with over 10,000 control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following autoimmune disorders were more prevalent in patients with CU: thyroid disorders, celiac disease, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, with considerable variability between males and females. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were also more prevalent than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among patients with CU, an autoimmune disorder was more likely to be diagnosed in the decade after the onset of CU, rather than before it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H557583\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroid disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 9.8 percent of CU patients (versus 0.6 percent of controls) and hyperthyroidism in 2.6 percent (versus 0.5 percent of controls) in the larger study mentioned previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A population-based Korean study found that individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves' disease) had higher rates of CU compared with controls (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Thyroid autoantibodies, specifically thyroid peroxidase antibodies or antimicrosomal antibodies, are more prevalent among patients with CU (12 to 30 percent), compared with members of the general population (5 to 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/10,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33-35</a>]. However, the presence of thyroid autoantibodies does not necessarily correlate with abnormal thyroid function, and the majority of patients with CU who have demonstrable thyroid autoantibodies have <strong>normal</strong> thyroid function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The role of these autoantibodies in CU in patients with normal thyroid function is not clear.

However, even in the absence of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, patients with thyroid autoantibodies are often poorly responsive to standard therapies for CU and have more persistent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease is reviewed elsewhere.

Guidelines do not suggest that malignancy screening be performed in patients with CU, unless indicated by specific abnormalities in the clinical history or physical exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. Studies that support this approach include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1155 Swedish patients with CU, subjects were followed by academic dermatologists for an average of 8.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The incidence of malignant cancer during the period of observation was compared with the expected number of cancers from the Swedish Cancer Registry, yielding a relative risk (RR) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.61-1.12). Thus, this study found no increased risk of malignancy in patients with CU.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review of 6462 patients described in 29 studies, internal diseases were detected as an underlying cause of CU in only 105 patients, or 1.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Within this group, there were 60 cases of urticarial vasculitis, 17 patients with thyroid disease, 7 with lupus, and 16 with other connective tissue disorders. Three patients had a paraproteinemia, four had polycythemia vera, and five had various malignancies (breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, and two unidentified cancers). Therefore, few malignancies were detected in this review, and no one type of cancer predominated.</p><p/><p>Subsequent to the publication of CU guidelines, a study of 12,720 Taiwanese patients found that there may be an increased risk of malignancy among patients with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this cohort, subjects were identified as having CU based upon the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM code for urticaria, combined with use of an antihistamine for at least six months over a two-year period. Patients with coexisting allergic disorders that could require chronic antihistamines, patients receiving immunosuppressant drugs for any reason, and those with pre-existing malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, or Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, were excluded. The rate of malignancies diagnosed in this cohort over an average follow-up period of five years was compared with expected rates, obtained from the Taiwan National Cancer Registry. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for patients with CU was 2.2 (95% CI 2.0-2.4).</p><p>Both the Swedish and Taiwanese studies were performed in countries in which people have unique identifying patient numbers and health data can be reliably captured. Neither study included data about possible confounders, such as smoking or alcohol use. The diagnosis of CU in the first study may have been made with greater accuracy, since patients were recruited and followed at an academic dermatology center, while those in the second study were gleaned from the entire population and were diagnosed in a variety of settings. Accordingly, patients in the second study may not have been as extensively evaluated for signs or symptoms of underlying disorders. In addition, the authors of the second study noted that there was no diagnostic code for urticarial vasculitis, so this diagnosis, which is known to be associated with malignancy, would not have been easily distinguished from uncomplicated urticaria. Therefore, although the Taiwanese study may have overestimated cancer risk, the association warrants further evaluation.</p><p>Until the association between chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and malignancy is better defined, it seems logical to continue to perform additional testing only if indicated by the patient's clinical history and physical exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CU is diagnosed clinically based upon the episodic and transient appearance of characteristic urticarial lesions, with or without angioedema, for a period of six weeks or longer.

Significant elevations in ESR or C-reactive protein (CRP) should prompt further investigation for systemic diseases, such as autoimmune, rheumatologic, infectious, or neoplastic diseases. Such an evaluation may include measurement of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), cryoglobulins, hepatitis B and C serologies, total hemolytic complement, and a serum protein electrophoresis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1264349\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TSH level</strong> &ndash; Some clinicians also obtain thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroglobulin, antimicrosomal antibodies, or both) in adults, while others do so only if the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

This review analyzed 29 studies (including 6462 patients), in which investigations for underlying medical disorders were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Potentially causative internal diseases were identified in only 1.6 percent of patients, and there was no association between the number of tests ordered and the identification of an underlying disorder. The reviewers concluded that ESR, complete blood count, and differential were useful screening tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1519355\"><span class=\"h3\">Investigational tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigational tests include the autologous serum skin test (ASST), various tests of basophil activation, and tests for autoantibodies to the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor or the Fc region of IgE. These tests are discussed separately.

There is accompanying angioedema in some patients. There should be no other signs of systemic illness, and laboratory testing is usually normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsy is not routinely needed for the diagnosis of CU. However, a 3 mm punch biopsy of a newly formed lesion should be performed to exclude urticarial vasculitis in patients with one or more of the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual lesions that persist beyond 24 hours, are painful rather than pruritic, have accompanying petechial or purpuric characteristics, or leave residual pigmentation upon resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/47,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">CRP/ESR</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic symptoms (eg, arthralgias, fever).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that are unresponsive to appropriate doses of antihistamines.

Mastocytosis is a rare disease that would be suspected in a patient in whom CU was accompanied by episodic signs and symptoms of systemic mast cell-mediator release, such as flushing, abdominal cramping and diarrhea, wheezing, lightheadedness, or syncope. (See <a href=\"#H1264349\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The biopsy sample should be obtained from a fresh lesion. Patients receiving glucocorticoids may need to discontinue these medications for several days in order to allow new lesions to form. Biopsy specimens should be submitted in formalin for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. In addition, if urticarial vasculitis is a strong consideration, a sample should be submitted in Michel's media or freshly snap frozen for direct immunofluorescence microscopy. Also consider testing for immunoglobulins in lesional skin when vasculitis is a consideration and in perilesional, noninvolved skin when considering autoimmune blistering disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Biopsy findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biopsy findings of CU vary somewhat among patients. Consistent features include interstitial edema with a perivascular mixed infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and in some areas, a few neutrophils or basophils. Lymphocytes are generally CD4+ T lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are not usually seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Angioedema, if present, often shows a similar infiltrate and is characterized by more prominent edema of the interstitial tissues.</p><p>Neutrophil-predominant urticaria, without vasculitis, is a variant of CU that is often refractory to standard pharmacologic treatments. The significance of neutrophil-predominant urticaria, in terms of preferred treatment or prognosis, is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Findings that are <strong>not</strong> characteristic of CU include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several disorders in the differential diagnosis for CU may also show a predominance of neutrophils, such as Schnitzler syndrome, delayed-pressure urticaria, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Biopsies in these disorders may also mistakenly be interpreted as leukocytoclastic vasculitis. (See <a href=\"#H1264349\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytoclasis should <strong>not</strong> be present in CU. Leukocytoclasis is the fragmentation of neutrophils resulting in scattered nuclear fragments (nuclear dust) in the infiltrate, red blood cell extravasation within the lumen of affected vessels or in the interstitium, and fibrinoid degeneration of the endothelial cells resulting in a blunted vascular outline with fibrin deposits. If leukocytoclasis is found, the diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and associated conditions should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Histology'</a> and <a href=\"#H1264349\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytoclasis accompanied by a dense cellular infiltrate consisting almost entirely of neutrophils, without evidence of vasculitis, should prompt evaluation for the rare disorder, neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis.

The best developed hypotheses include the autoimmune theory, theories involving histamine-releasing factors, and the cellular defects theory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune theory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept that CU could represent an autoimmune disorder arose from the recognition that thyroid dysfunction and thyroid autoantibodies are more prevalent in patients with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/9,29,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29,33,34</a>]. This led to a search for autoantibodies and other serum factors that could be responsible for increased release of histamine from cutaneous mast cells and basophils. A European taskforce panel of CU experts published a statement in 2013 concluding that there was persuasive but not conclusive evidence for the existence of autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) as a specific disease entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The evidence suggesting that CU may be an autoimmune disorder in some patients is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H94601717\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune disorders'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10997853\"><span class=\"h3\">The autologous serum skin test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One area of investigation suggesting that CU is an autoimmune disorder was introduced in the 1980s with the description of the autologous serum skin test (ASST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The ASST is proposed to provide an in vivo assay of mast cell activation induced by factors in the patients' serum. The ASST involves intradermal injection of the patients' own serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. In preparation for this test, patients must refrain from taking antihistamines for three to seven days (depending upon the half-life of the specific drug), which can cause an exacerbation in symptoms.</p><p>In up to one-half of patients with CU, the intradermal injection of serum produces a wheal-and-flare reaction (ie, area of cutaneous edema and erythema) at the site of injection within 30 minutes (note that the time to maximal reaction is longer than 15 minutes seen in allergen skin testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In vitro tests of mast cell activation are lacking because mast cells are tissue-based cells that are not easily collected or cultured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1519631\"><span class=\"h4\">Problems with the ASST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The leading argument against the clinical significance of the autologous serum skin test (ASST) is that a positive test is not unique to patients with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. In one study, positive ASSTs were found in 53 percent of patients with CU, 20 percent of patients with nonallergic <span class=\"nowrap\">asthma/rhinitis,</span> and 56 percent of healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In addition, the positivity of the ASST persists in patients with CU, even when the disorder is in clinical remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Finally, the ASST has not demonstrated clinical utility in identifying patients who respond differently to treatment or whose disease follows a different clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/60,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,73,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sera of patients with CU and positive ASSTs are capable of causing in vitro histamine release from basophils collected from control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. It was therefore proposed that an autoantibody or other histamine-releasing factor was present in the serum of these patients.</p><p>At least two candidate autoantibodies have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/66,71,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,71,75,76</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules directed against the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor alpha subunit (anti-Fc-epsilon-R1-alpha)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human IgG molecules directed against the Fc region of IgE (anti-IgE)</p><p/><p>The presence of IgG autoantibodies to the IgE receptor or the Fc region of IgE can be demonstrated in as many as 30 to 50 percent of children and adults with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/2,64,77-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,64,77-81</a>].

In addition, the levels of autoantibodies in CU do not appear to change with the clinical activity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], and the presence of these autoantibodies does not predict more difficult-to-manage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Also problematic, is the fact that commercial assays for anti-Fc-epsilon-RI-alpha antibodies are based upon basophil activation tests, for which there are no widely accepted standards across laboratories. The technical difficulties of studying basophils are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H1181729\" class=\"local\">'Problems in basophil studies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1180430\"><span class=\"h2\">Theories involving other serum or plasma factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other factors in the serum or plasma have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CU because of an ability to activate mast cells or basophils, either directly or indirectly. No single factor has been shown to be essential for a positive ASST, and it remains unclear why serologic factors would activate only skin mast cells rather than causing more generalized mast cell and basophil activation leading to anaphylaxis, yet patients with CU are not at increased risk for anaphylaxis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study tested sera from patients with CU and normal controls for the ability to induce endothelial cell permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Although neither group's sera alone induced endothelial cell permeability, the majority of CU sera caused mast cell degranulation when incubated with different mast cell lines, one of which lacked IgE receptors. Supernatants from activated mast cell cultures did increase endothelial cell permeability. This property persisted when the sera were depleted of IgG and was unrelated to the ability of the sera to cause a positive ASST.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The observation that many patients with CU improve with anti-IgE therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>) implies that there may be an abnormal IgE present, which recognizes an unknown antigen(s) and activates mast cells and basophils. Studies of omalizumab for the management of refractory CU are reviewed separately. A variation on this theory proposes that there are individuals with IgE against self-antigens, but there are limited data for this concept. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms#H22592681\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Treatment of refractory symptoms&quot;, section on 'Omalizumab'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine-releasing factors in the plasma have also been proposed. Some patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) demonstrate excessive or abnormal production of platelet-derived clotting factors, such as thrombin, possibly resulting from activation of the extrinsic pathway of the clotting cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>]. In one study, the plasma of 28 patients with CU contained higher levels of the polypeptide F1+2, which is produced upon activation of prothrombin to thrombin, compared with control plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The levels of this peptide correlated with the severity of the patients' urticaria. Thrombin, in turn, is capable of activating mast cells and basophils and also increasing the permeability of blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>]. In addition, thrombin can stimulate the generation of C5a, which has been shown to enhance IgG-dependent mast cell histamine release in patients with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Other groups have also found abnormalities in the coagulation system that correlate with CU severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The identification of abnormalities in clotting factors lead to the autologous plasma skin test (APST), a variant of the ASST in which sodium citrate-anticoagulated plasma is injected intradermally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Subsequently, two basophil phenotypes were identified in patients with CU: one type with an apparently normal response to Fc-epsilon-RI activation (&quot;responders&quot;) and another type of basophil that does not respond to IgE-mediated activation (&quot;nonresponders&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. These phenotypes are present in approximately equal numbers in patients with CU, unlike in normals, where &quot;nonresponders&quot; comprise only about 10 to 15 percent of the population. The nonresponder phenotype demonstrates elevated intracellular levels of regulatory proteins that normally inhibit signaling through Fc-epsilon-RI.

IgE-mediated food allergy is far more likely to present with acute urticaria as part of generalized allergic reactions. Despite this, up to one-half of adult patients initially perceive a relationship between food and episodes of urticaria. Patients' suspicion about the role of foods and food additives is fueled by the fact that many will notice that dietary variations can cause temporary fluctuations in CU symptoms. In particular, rich meals, spicy or fermented foods, alcohol, and dramatic changes in diet will often worsen the condition temporarily. This may be related to the histamine content or innate histamine-releasing properties of these foods, as well as the vasodilatory effects of alcohol and certain spices.

No specific cause can be identified in 80 to 90 percent of adults and children with CU. A complete blood count with differential, a C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level are suggested at diagnosis, although these laboratories are normal in most patients who lack signs and symptoms of systemic disease.
