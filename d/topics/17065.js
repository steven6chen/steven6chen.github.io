Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide and accounts for nearly 4 percent of all new cases of cancer in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is also the eighth most common cause of cancer death in the world. The risk of ovarian cancer increased with age with only 10 to 15 percent of cases diagnosed before menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With increasing age, there is an increased prevalence of comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, functional dependence, cognitive impairment, depression, frailty, poor nutrition, and limited social support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Given these many potential limitations, it is not surprising that many older adult patients who present with advanced ovarian cancer receive less aggressive therapies than their younger counterparts and have poorer disease-specific outcomes. Because there are limited data on the approach to older women with gynecologic cancer in general, this topic will specifically discuss the care of the older woman with ovarian cancer.</p><p>Other topics related to the cancer care of this population are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2112507975\" class=\"local\">'Geriatric assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>The results of the assessment can be used to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are candidates for CRS should proceed with primary surgical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H27668664\" class=\"local\">'Approach to surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are not candidates for CRS should be offered chemotherapy, provided they are also candidates for medical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H27668831\" class=\"local\">'Approach to first-line medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are neither candidates for CRS nor for medical treatment should be referred for palliative care and hospice services. Treatment for these patients should be focused on symptom management. (See <a href=\"#H27668880\" class=\"local\">'Palliative care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Treatment for ovarian cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes consideration of both surgery and medical therapy. Therefore, all patients should be evaluated by a specialized team that includes a gynecologic oncologist whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2112507975\"><span class=\"h1\">GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Geriatric assessment (GA) provides clinicians with a formal way to evaluate a patient's functional status (ie, ability to live independently at home and in the community), comorbid medical conditions, cognition, psychological status, social <span class=\"nowrap\">functioning/support,</span> and nutritional status. Several studies have demonstrated the predictive value of GA for estimating the risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy and survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p>Unfortunately, a validated instrument for assessment specifically for the older patient with ovarian cancer is not yet available. For patients with ovarian cancer, separate GAs are conducted for evaluation preoperatively and then prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. These are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2112507989\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A validated instrument for assessment of the older adult patient with cancer does not yet exist. Despite this, there are several assessments under study for breast and other solid tumors, which may be applicable to this population. Ongoing research is aimed at prospective evaluation of these and other tools to remove the guesswork from assessing a patient&rsquo;s fitness for surgery.</p><p>Given the importance of the issue of preoperative assessment, the American College of Surgeons released a position paper in 2012 outlining best practices for the optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, the NRG-Oncology Cooperative Group completed a GA study in older adults (ELD1301, NRG-CC002), which used a modified Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE) tool, to determine the benefit of a modified GA in predicting postsurgical complications in women undergoing primary CRS (pCRS). The study has completed accrual and conclusions are underway.</p><p>The PACE and other tools that can be used as part of a preoperative GA are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1030730\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PACE tool was developed to combine elements of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) with surgical risk assessment tools.

In one study that included data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, main results included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 30-day postoperative mortality rate among women &gt;65 years (who underwent either primary CRS or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by an interval CRS) was 8.2 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with women who underwent surgery as scheduled, those who had emergent surgery had a higher incidence of 30-day postoperative mortality (20 versus 5.6 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients scheduled for surgery, each year over age 65 was associated with a 7.5 percent increase in the risk of 30-day mortality (95% CI 1.06-1.10).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who underwent surgery emergently, each year over age 65 was associated with a 2.8 percent increase in the risk of 30-day mortality (95% CI 1.01-1.05).</p><p/><p>A risk score has been proposed to identify patients who are being evaluated for primary CRS and may be at risk for death within 30 days, which uses age, stage, and comorbidity score. The highest-risk group is comprised of women 75 years of age or older with stage IV disease (or stage III disease plus a comorbidity score of 1 or more). In this SEER-Medicare study, this group had a 30-day postoperative mortality of 12.7 percent, which accounted for 50 percent of the deaths in the entire cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although not prospectively evaluated, such a score may provide valuable information to inform candidacy for CRS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2179958070\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative morbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative complications are important to avoid, not only for the obvious reason of eliminating patient discomfort and risk, but also because certain complications are associated with a reduction in overall survival (OS). This is not to say that patients die of their complications (ie, postoperative death), but the complication compromises the ability of the patient to survive their cancer. The importance of this was shown in a National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) study where the most important determinant of decreased survival following surgery for patients with solid tumors was the occurrence of a major complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In ovarian cancer surgery, two or more complications increased the risk of death from cancer by almost 30 percent (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.15-1.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This was shown in a study that utilized data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) registry that included almost 29,000 patients admitted for ovarian cancer surgery.

In the study using data from the NIS registry, age and number of radical procedures appeared to be associated with the frequency of nontraditional discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 1 percent of patients &lt;50 years were not discharged to home.

Some data on this topic include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, data from SEER show that 12 percent of patients do not receive chemotherapy, which appears unrelated to complications or number of radical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Significant factors associated with the lack of chemotherapy included ASA score and the surgical complexity score.</p><p>In the randomized clinical trial of primary CRS versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by an interval CRS conducted by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 55971), almost 7 percent of those women who underwent primary CRS did not receive chemotherapy, and in most of these cases, it was due to excessive post-surgery complications or the diagnosis of another primary tumor. The results of this trial are discussed separately.

Those who received debulking surgery and optimal chemotherapy (six cycles within an appropriate timeframe) had the best overall survival (39 months), an association that was maintained after multivariate analysis controlling for demographics, cancer type, and comorbidities.</p><p/><p>There is a lack of prospective data from clinical trials to inform the chemotherapy tolerance threshold in older adult patients. Most published reports are retrospective or secondary analyses of large clinical trials, which usually include a healthier, younger population.

Between 1998 and 2003, two prospective studies were conducted to assess the tolerability of standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. In both studies, the selected population was comprised of older adult patients aged &ge;70 years with liberal inclusion criteria. Importantly, all patients completed a baseline geriatric assessment (GA). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EWOC1 &ndash; In the first study, 83 patients (median age 76) with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> ovarian cancer were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> (AUC 5) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> on day 1 every 28-day (CC) combination for six cycles.

Patients in the EWOC2 trial appeared to be younger and with better PS than those in the EWOC1, indicating a selection bias, likely due concern that the CP regimen could be associated with a higher toxicity if given to older patients.

Its use is gaining popularity in both the United States (US) and Europe, particularly for older and frail patients, given NACT is associated with less surgical toxicity. In an observational study of over 1500 women with stages IIIC to IV ovarian cancer, NACT use increased from 16 percent during 2003 to 2010 to 34 percent during 2011 to 2012 among those with stage IIIC disease, and from 41 to 62 percent among those with stage IV disease. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-ovarian-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Ovarian cancer, predominantly a disease of postmenopausal women, should also increase in prevalence with an increasingly aged population. (See <a href=\"#H27668657\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients should undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) at their initial presentation to determine whether or not they are appropriate candidates for cytoreductive surgery (CRS). (See <a href=\"#H2179957134\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Geriatric assessment (GA) provides clinicians with a formal way to evaluate a patient's functional status (ie, ability to live independently at home and in the community), comorbid medical conditions, cognition, psychological status, social functioning-support, and nutritional status. Several studies have demonstrated the predictive value of GA for estimating the risk of severe toxicity from chemotherapy and survival outcomes. Unfortunately, a validated instrument for assessment specifically for the older patient with ovarian cancer is not yet available. (See <a href=\"#H2112507989\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE) tool was developed to combine elements of the CGA with surgical risk assessment tools. However, while promising, it has not yet been evaluated in patients who are being considered for higher-risk surgeries. (See <a href=\"#H1030730\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with the preoperative assessment, there is a clear need for a simple and short screening test for older vulnerable women with ovarian cancer undergoing chemotherapy. While validated tools are available, none are routinely used in clinical gynecologic oncological practice at this time. (See <a href=\"#H2112508024\" class=\"local\">'Prior to systemic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients initially diagnosed with ovarian cancer should be evaluated for CRS, regardless of age. However, there will be a proportion of patients who present with advanced ovarian cancer in whom primary CRS is not indicated (eg, those with a poor performance status <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with radiologically or clinically unresectable disease). (See <a href=\"#H2179957823\" class=\"local\">'Primary cytoreductive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients deemed to be poor candidates for primary CRS, interval CRS can be offered after initial treatment using neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Multiple randomized trials show that survival outcomes appear to be similar among women who undergo a primary versus an interval CRS. However, perioperative complications were lower in those patients receiving NACT.
