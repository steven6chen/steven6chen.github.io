These spots often itch or hurt. Lichen planus can affect the skin anywhere on the body, including the skin in and around the vagina and penis, and the pink, moist skin that lines the mouth.</p><p>In most cases, doctors do not know what causes lichen planus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12719000\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of lichen planus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lichen planus causes different symptoms, depending on which part of the body is affected.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the <strong>skin</strong>, it usually causes shiny, flat, red, or purple spots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87024\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87024 \">picture 1</a>). These spots tend to form on the wrists, arms, or legs, but might also show up on other areas. The spots are often very itchy. As the spots heal, they can turn dark.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the <strong>nails</strong>, it can cause lines or ridges to form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the &quot;<strong>mucous membranes</strong>,&quot; the pink moist skin that lines the inside of the mouth, the vagina, and other organs, it can cause redness, painful sores, or patterns that look like white lace. When lichen planus affects the mouth, it can make it hard to eat.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12719041\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms like those listed above, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell if you have lichen planus by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. It&rsquo;s also possible your doctor or nurse will take a small sample of skin to send to the lab. This is called a skin &quot;biopsy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12719058\"><span class=\"h1\">How is lichen planus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is different depending on which part of the body is affected and how bad the symptoms are. In general, treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines that come in ointments, creams, or gels &ndash; These steroid medicines reduce inflammation and help the skin heal. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluocinonide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">clobetasol</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called calcineurin inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pimecrolimus</a> (brand name: Elidel) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tacrolimus</a> (brand name: Protopic).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that numb the skin and help with pain, especially for people who have sores on their mouth or sex organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pills that help to reduce inflammation and help the skin heal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A special type of light treatment called phototherapy</p><p/><p>Some people need to try more than one medicine before they find the medicine that works best for them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12719073\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some things you should do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take good care of your skin. Wash and dry your skin gently when you take a shower or bath. Try not to scratch itchy skin because that can increase the chance of infection. Scratching can also make lichen planus worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have lichen planus in your mouth, make sure you take good care of your teeth and gums. You should brush your teeth twice a day with a soft brush and floss every day. Not taking good care of your mouth could make lichen planus worse and might cause other problems from unhealthy teeth and gums.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12719088\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-sclerosus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lichen sclerosus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-itching-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar itching (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyspareunia-painful-sex-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dyspareunia (painful sex) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lichen sclerosus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
