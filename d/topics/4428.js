These are noted below.

Either whole blood or platelet-rich plasma is used depending on the technique. Since many common medications can affect platelet function, care must be taken to avoid their use in patients prior to testing. Common agonists used in these assays include ADP, arachidonic acid, collagen, epinephrine, thrombin, and ristocetin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'Platelet aggregometry'</a>.)</p><p>Normal platelet aggregation in vitro in response to ADP and epinephrine involves a biphasic response. The first wave of aggregation reflects activation of integrin &alpha;<sub>IIb</sub>&beta;<sub>3</sub> and subsequent crosslinking of platelets via fibrinogen binding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81908\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81908 \">figure 1</a>). The second wave reflects platelet degranulation and enhanced aggregation due to the release of platelet agonists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56188 \">figure 2</a>). Arachidonic acid, collagen and thrombin provoke only a single burst of aggregation.

This device uses two separate cartridges that distinguish between an aspirin-induced defect and more severe platelet dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'The platelet function analyzer'</a>.)</p><p>One study compared results with the PFA-100 and standard platelet aggregometry in subjects with abnormal platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The sensitivity (94 versus 95 percent) and specificity (88 versus 89 percent) of the two tests were remarkably similar. An aspirin-induced defect was detected with a sensitivity of 96 versus 100 percent and von Willebrand disease and Glanzmann thrombasthenia were confirmed with sensitivities of 96 percent for the PFA-100 versus 80 percent with standard aggregometry. The PFA-100 is less sensitive to other specific platelet disorders such as storage pool disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In a study involving 113 patients, both the bleeding time (BT) and PFA-100 were used and showed concordant results in 74 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the 29 patients with discordant results, 23 had abnormal findings with the PFA-100 but a normal BT. When platelet aggregometry was performed, 17 of these 23 patients had a defect consistent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> effect. A second study concluded that the PFA-100 was as sensitive to the effects of aspirin on platelet function as the template BT, with less variability and fewer false positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There are numerous studies clearly showing superior sensitivity of the PFA-100 versus the BT in screening for VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In several studies, the sensitivity of the PFA-100 was uniformly higher than the BT (84 to 97 percent versus 48 to 66 percent), although the sensitivity of the PFA-100 varied with the severity of the VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>While the PFA-100 is very sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>'s effect on platelets, it is insensitive to other therapeutic anti-platelet agents, including COX-2 inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, and heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

However, there are many variables that can influence its accuracy and it is no longer used in routine practice. It is not useful as a preoperative screening test in patients without a history of bleeding and it cannot accurately assess platelet dysfunction in the presence of thrombocytopenia. There is also general consensus that the BT should not be routinely used preoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

By blocking thromboxane A2 production, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction are inhibited.
