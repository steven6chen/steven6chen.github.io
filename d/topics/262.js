Commonly triggered by viral infections, ADEM is caused by an inflammatory reaction in the brain and spinal cord. Its onset is acute and often rapidly progressive. ADEM is typically monophasic, but some patients may either have recurrences, or have an ADEM-like presentation as the first attack of a chronic demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, pathology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in adults. Clinical aspects of ADEM in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267831\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of ADEM is reviewed here briefly and discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Although the pathogenesis is incompletely understood, ADEM appears to be an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that is triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. One proposed mechanism is that myelin autoantigens, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte protein, share antigenic determinants with those of an infecting pathogen. Antiviral antibodies or a cell-mediated response to the pathogen cross react with the myelin autoantigens, resulting in ADEM.</p><p>Alternatively, ADEM may be due to increased vascular permeability and congestion in the central nervous system, perhaps triggered by circulating immune complexes or other humoral factors that develop after the appearance of a foreign antigen introduced by infection or vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. This process then leads to infiltration of the vessel walls by mononuclear cells, followed by perivenous edema and occasionally hemorrhages. Within days, microglia, lymphocytes, and phagocytes appear, ultimately causing demyelination and possible gliosis and necrosis. The extent of demyelination and subsequent glial and neuronal changes account for the variation in clinical features and disease prognosis.</p><p>A combination of these two mechanisms may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Altered vascular permeability and inflammation may lead to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, allowing for the release of previously sequestered antigens and consequently triggering a cell-mediated immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267837\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gross neuropathologic sections of patients with ADEM often reveal edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], although in other cases the brain may appear normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most common histopathologic finding is perivenous infiltration of lymphocytes; neutrophils, plasma cells, microglial cells, foamy macrophages, and eosinophilic granulocytes have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Many reports emphasize the finding of perivenous sleeves of inflammation and demyelination as the pathologic hallmark and predominant lesion of ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-12</a>]. In some ADEM cases, these perivenous lesions may eventually coalesce to form confluent regions of demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This is in contrast with multiple sclerosis, where the confluent lesion is the predominant feature at the initiation of the pathologic process and is associated with infiltration of macrophages and astrocytes.</p><p>Myelin breakdown products are seen as lipids in macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An inflammatory infiltrate surrounding blood vessels is often described as cuffing of vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Additional features may include vasculitic-type lesions consisting of inflammation in the vessel walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], perivascular necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>], lymphocytic infiltration of the meninges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and glial nodules in gray matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Reactive astrocytes are seen in some cases, and gliosis often replaces the inflammatory exudate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Axonal damage has been observed in fatal cases of ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267843\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADEM is an uncommon illness, but the precise incidence is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is thought to occur more frequently in children than adults (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-children-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>). In retrospective studies, ADEM is associated with a preceding infection or vaccination in 50 to 75 percent of adult cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Among cases with an identified precipitant, most are associated with natural infection, and a small minority with vaccination. ADEM has been reported in adults 18 to 82 years of age; the median age ranges from 33 to 41 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18-20</a>].</p><p>ADEM is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection. However, an underlying pathogen is not always identified, and ADEM may follow a nonspecific upper respiratory or gastrointestinal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. The list of infectious pathogens associated with ADEM includes rubella, mumps, varicella, measles, smallpox, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus-6, influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,7,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,22-26</a>].</p><p>Although early reports suggested that a small minority of ADEM cases followed immunization, subsequent studies have found little or no association between ADEM and immunization. The frequency of ADEM in the United States following any vaccine was explored using the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which captured approximately 64 million doses of 24 different vaccines administered between 2007 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There was no increase in the risk of ADEM during the primary exposure window (5 to 28 days prior to onset) for any vaccine with the possible exception of the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (odds ratio [OR] 15.8, 95% CI 1.2-471.6). However, this result was based on only two cases of ADEM, one of whom received a second vaccine concurrent with Tdap. In addition, adjustments for multiple comparisons were not performed. Overall, the attributable risk for ADEM following Tdap was 0.385 per one million doses (95% CI 0.04-1.16).</p><p>In early reports, ADEM sometimes occurred after administration of the rabies (Semple) vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Typically, adults and children developed encephalomyelitis 8 to 21 days following the immunization (range 6 to 45 days). Neurologic complications suggestive of ADEM were also reported (rarely) after vaccines against smallpox, influenza, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, rubella, and polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,29-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267849\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic descriptions of ADEM involve a preceding illness, or less often a vaccination, in most but not all cases (see <a href=\"#H193267843\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). After a lag time of a few days to two months (mean 26 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], the typical presentation involves the acute onset of multifocal neurologic symptoms, often with rapid deterioration prompting hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/18,19,21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21,33</a>].</p><p>Nonspecific signs that can accompany ADEM include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Altered mental status (ie, encephalopathy) is present in 20 to 56 percent of adult cases, ranging from irritability, confusion, and psychosis to somnolence and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,17,18</a>]. Most patients present with motor deficits; these may involve a single limb or result in paraparesis or tetraparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>]. Sensory deficits are frequent. Brainstem involvement is also common, including oculomotor deficits and dysarthria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Additional signs and symptoms may include meningismus, ataxia, aphasia, optic neuritis (sometimes bilateral), nystagmus, extrapyramidal movement disorders, urinary retention, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278794034\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis is considered a variant type of ADEM. Some experts recognize additional variants of ADEM, including site-restricted forms such as postinfectious myelitis or myeloradiculoneuritis, and a form with mixed central and peripheral nervous system involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278794085\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), also called acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL) or acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE) of Weston-Hurst, is considered a hyperacute variant of ADEM. Typically, AHEM presents after an illness or vaccination, with meningismus, headache, seizures, multifocal neurologic signs, asymmetrical neurologic deficits, and rapid progression to coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Head CT and MRI usually reveal hemorrhagic lesions in the white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional pathologic features include edema, petechial hemorrhages of the corona radiata, perivascular hemorrhages, destruction of the vessel walls with fibrin deposition, and neutrophilic infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Neuroimaging in one rapidly fatal case did not reveal the presence of hemorrhagic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89986 \">figure 1</a>); however, focal hemorrhages were seen on gross sections of the brain at autopsy in the white matter of the bilateral posterior frontal and parietal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H278794145\"><span class=\"h3\">ADEM with peripheral nervous system involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with postinfectious neurologic syndromes may have clinical or subclinical electrodiagnostic evidence of peripheral nervous system involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,34</a>]. As an example, one report evaluated 176 adults (median age 69 years), consisting of one group with purely central nervous system syndromes (30 with encephalitis, 35 with encephalomyelitis, and 47 with myelitis) and a second group with both central and peripheral nervous system syndromes (30 patients with encephalomyeloradiculoneuritis and 34 with myeloradiculoneuritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Peripheral nerve involvement was defined by the presence of electrodiagnostic abnormalities. Clinical symptoms of peripheral nerve injury, including distal limb paresthesia, perineal anesthesia, and muscle atrophy, were present in 29 of the 64 patients (46 percent) with electrodiagnostic evidence of peripheral nerve injury. Patients with peripheral nerve involvement were significantly older and had a worse prognosis and an elevated risk of relapses compared with those having only central nervous system syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267855\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is the imaging modality of choice, although an urgent CT scan may be necessary in order to exclude other causes of neurologic disease. Lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most patients have multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter, characteristic of demyelination. On MRI, the lesions of ADEM are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89988\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89988 \">image 1</a>)[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], and are usually inconspicuous on unenhanced T1-weighted sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, large lesions can be slightly hypointense on unenhanced T1 sequences. There can be considerable heterogeneity: large confluent lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111832\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111832 \">image 2</a>), single solitary lesions, and multiple small lesions have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/10,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,39</a>]. Lesions may be seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, including corpus callosum and centrum semiovale, as well as in the gray matter, including the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15,17,18,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18,40</a>]. Infratentorial lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>], although an isolated spinal cord lesion without supratentorial involvement is rare in ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>While the studies cited above have observed that MRI is almost always abnormal in ADEM, one series reported that brain MRI was normal in 5 of 10 adults with ADEM, even after multiple repeated scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Others have noted that there may be a delay in the appearance of MRI lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/33,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,41,42</a>]; in one report the time lag to MRI lesion appearance was eight weeks from ADEM symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Gadolinium enhancement of MRI lesions in ADEM is variable. Enhancing and nonenhancing lesions may appear together in the same scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,18,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,33</a>]. Even though ADEM is considered a monophasic illness, repeat imaging early in the disease course has shown fluctuation in the presence of both enhancing and nonenhancing lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. New asymptomatic lesions may appear while others seemingly resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Many MRI lesions resolve within 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], although some patients have residual lesions on follow-up imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>With diffusion-weighted MRI imaging (DWI), lesions associated with ADEM show restricted diffusion (ie, decreased apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] values) in the acute stage, defined as within seven days from symptom onset, whereas increased diffusivity and normalization of the ADC is seen within a few weeks after the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,40</a>].</p><p>Head CT is often normal, especially early in the course of ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, some patients may have evidence of focal or multifocal white matter damage on head CT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267861\"><span class=\"h2\">Lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in ADEM are variable; abnormalities are present in 50 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15,17,18,21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18,21,26</a>]. Typical abnormalities in ADEM are nonspecific and include a lymphocytic pleocytosis, usually with a CSF white blood cell count &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL,</span> and a mildly elevated CSF protein of &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> although higher counts have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5,10,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,18,21</a>]. Oligoclonal bands are present in 6 to 65 percent of patients with ADEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267867\"><span class=\"h2\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ancillary tests, including evoked potentials and electroencephalogram (EEG), have been studied in ADEM, but the findings are usually nonspecific.

Given this, some authors do not feel it contributes to the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], whereas others argue that the presence of focal slowing or epileptiform discharges is useful in documenting central nervous system involvement, especially if the MRI and cerebrospinal fluid findings are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193267873\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ADEM is considered in patients with acute multifocal neurologic signs and symptoms, and without a history of previously unexplained neurologic symptoms.</p><p>The evaluation of a patient with suspected ADEM begins with a detailed clinical history and examination, which often reveals polyfocal neurologic symptoms. The presence of encephalopathy, observed in approximately one-half of adults, is supportive of the diagnosis. Most patients present to an emergency room, where a head CT and lumbar puncture are often performed acutely, given the rapid progression of neurologic symptoms and the need to exclude other diagnoses (see <a href=\"#H193267879\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Nevertheless, MRI is the neuroimaging modality of choice to evaluate ADEM. An MRI of the brain, with and without gadolinium, can be performed when the patient has stabilized. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine also may be indicated to confirm the extent of inflammation if there are symptoms or signs of myelopathy.</p><p>A lumbar puncture is an important part of the evaluation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations should include cell counts, protein, glucose, culture, oligoclonal band profile (including the presence or absence of oligoclonal bands, immunoglobulin G [IgG] synthesis rate, and IgG index), and viral studies if suggested by the clinical history.</p><p>There are no specific biomarkers or confirmatory tests to establish the diagnosis of ADEM. However, the diagnosis is supported by the presence of one or more supratentorial or infratentorial demyelinating lesions on brain MRI and the absence of destructive &quot;black hole&quot; lesions on T1-weighted MRI, which suggest prior episodes of inflammation or demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A preceding infection and abnormal CSF (a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly elevated protein) are suggestive of ADEM, but not required for the diagnosis.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for ADEM have been proposed for children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74896 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

Acute viral encephalitis typically affects the gray matter and can present with seizures, as seen in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. The most important diagnostic consideration in patients with encephalitis is HSV since delay in treatment can impact morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CSF examination of patients with suspected meningitis or encephalitis is essential for diagnosis. A lymphocytic predominance is suggestive of a viral etiology; the presence of red blood cells in the absence of a traumatic tap is suggestive of HSV or other necrotizing viral encephalitides. Diagnostic CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV-1 and IgM antibody in CSF and serum for West Nile virus are recommended for patients with encephalitis. Testing for other viral pathogens will depend on travel or exposure history to insects and animals. Serologic testing for West Nile virus, mumps, and Epstein-Barr virus can also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

The pathologic finding is non-caseating granulomas. Neurologic complications occur in approximately 5 percent of patients with sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cranial mononeuropathy, neuroendocrine dysfunction, a focal or multifocal encephalopathy, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis, peripheral neuropathy, or myopathy, are the most common features of neurologic sarcoidosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>). Parenchymal involvement mimicking inflammatory disorders such as ADEM or multiple sclerosis may also be seen. Sarcoid is more commonly a chronic recurrent disease and less likely to be monophasic. However, patients presenting with neurosarcoidosis may have no systemic features of the disease and thus present a diagnostic challenge. Thus, the diagnostic evaluation requires distinguishing neurosarcoidosis from a variety of other inflammatory and infectious conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>A thorough evaluation for systemic sarcoidosis (eg, chest imaging) can expedite the evaluation by providing tissue that is accessible for biopsy. In the absence of systemic sarcoidosis, testing that may be helpful includes contrast-enhanced MRI of the affected area (brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spinal cord), cerebrospinal fluid evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-sarcoidosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>) and serum angiotensin converting enzyme level.

Headaches, seizures, and cognitive, mood, or behavioral changes can occur in ADEM but are more common in some vasculitides. MR angiography may reveal abnormal vessels, but is often non-diagnostic. While conventional angiography is perhaps more sensitive in the diagnosis of vasculitis, it may still be negative; leptomeningeal biopsy may be necessary to increase the diagnostic yield. Vasculitis secondary to systemic autoimmune diseases can be diagnosed by the appropriate rheumatologic serologies and other systemic manifestations.</p><p>Patients with primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) may present with an altered mental status, followed by the accrual of multifocal CNS deficits (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-angiitis-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary angiitis of the central nervous system in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). Signs and symptoms of systemic vasculitis, such as peripheral neuropathy, fever, weight loss, or rash, are usually absent. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with elevated protein is typical but not specific for PACNS. MRI of the brain commonly shows multiple infarcts in multiple vascular territories, and often in areas of the brain not affected by more common causes of stroke (such as the corpus callosum). However, these findings are not specific for PACNS. Cerebral angiography findings that are compatible with (but not diagnostic of) PACNS include beading, circumferential or eccentric luminal narrowing, occlusions of one or more arteries, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an avascular mass effect, but the sensitivity and specificity of angiography for the diagnosis are suboptimal. The gold standard for the diagnosis of PACNS is histopathology of the leptomeninges and underlying cortex. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">brain/leptomeningeal</span> biopsies are only about 75 percent sensitive for the diagnosis of PACNS.

Similar to ADEM, patients with PML may present with multifocal neurologic deficits, including motor weakness, visual changes, and cognitive impairment. Its onset may be less acutely fulminant than ADEM, but progresses rapidly over several months, usually resulting in severe disability and death. The typical appearance of PML on neuroimaging studies consists of symmetric or asymmetric multifocal areas of white matter demyelination that do not conform to cerebrovascular territories and exhibit neither mass effect nor contrast enhancement.

Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is more common (and often more severe) along the ancient silk road, which extends from eastern Asia to the Mediterranean; the prevalence is much lower in North America and northern Europe.

Recurrent ADEM frequently responds to glucocorticoid treatment.</p><p>ADEM relapses that involve a new CNS territory should raise suspicion for multiple sclerosis. As discussed above, the International Pediatric MS Study Group (IPMSSG) have defined ADEM by the simultaneous presence of polyfocal neurologic symptoms and encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].

The presence of oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index is more common in multiple sclerosis, but can also be seen in ADEM. (See <a href=\"#H193267861\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ADEM is considered in patients with acute multifocal neurologic signs and symptoms without a history of unexplained neurologic symptoms. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of one or more supratentorial or infratentorial demyelinating lesions on brain MRI and the absence of destructive &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; lesions on T1-weighted MRI. A preceding infection or vaccination and abnormal CSF are suggestive of ADEM, but not required for the diagnosis. There are no specific biomarkers to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H193267873\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, ADEM is difficult to distinguish from multiple sclerosis. Other entities to be considered in the differential of ADEM include infectious meningoencephalitis, neurologic sarcoidosis, vasculitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H193267879\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected ADEM who present with symptoms suggestive of encephalitis, empiric treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> should be started and continued until an infectious etiology is excluded. Immune suppression is the mainstay of treatment for ADEM. For adults with ADEM, we recommend initial therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Reasonable regimens include intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1000 mg daily for three to five days. For those who have an insufficient response to intravenous glucocorticoid treatment, we suggest intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> treatment, 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> intravenously daily for five days, or plasma exchange (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H193267921\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with ADEM improve with treatment, but complete recovery occurs in only 10 to 46 percent of adult patients, with motor deficits <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive impairment often persisting in the remainder. In fulminant cases, death may result. Relapses, though unusual, have occurred. In other instances, ADEM progresses into multiple sclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H193267927\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2257771921\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dina Jacobs, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Poser CM.
