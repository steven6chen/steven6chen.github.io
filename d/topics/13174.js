He related atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcation to ischemic symptoms in the ipsilateral eye and brain. The modern era has seen an extraordinary expansion in our approach to the diagnosis and management of patients with carotid artery stenosis.</p><p>Stroke, due to atherothrombosis of the extracranial carotid arteries, is caused by a combination of factors involving the blood vessels, the clotting system, and hemodynamics. This interaction explains the mechanism of ischemic stroke in patients with carotid atheroma which may be due to artery-to-artery embolism or low cerebral blood flow.</p><p>The classification of symptomatic status of the internal carotid artery, the mechanism of symptom production, and the associated physical signs are reviewed here. Other issues, such as the methods for evaluating carotid stenosis and therapies available for the treatment of carotid artery disease, are discussed separately.

The plaque encroaches on the lumen of the internal carotid artery and often extends caudally into the common carotid artery. An hourglass configuration to the stenosis typically develops with time.</p><p>Regardless of their location, carotid plaques were associated with an increased risk of stroke in an observational study of older adult men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and an increased risk of mortality in an observational study of older adult men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to a reduction in vessel diameter induced by the enlarging plaque, thrombus can become superimposed on the atheroma which will further increase the degree of stenosis. Thus, the mechanism of stroke may be embolism of the thrombotic material or low flow due to the stenosis with inadequate collateral compensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/1,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-8</a>].</p><p>The most compelling argument for emboli as the cause of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke has been the angiographic evidence of a stem or branch occlusion above a carotid stenosis. In addition, several investigators have observed material passing through small retinal arteries during an attack of monocular ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and transcranial Doppler ultrasound has verified the passage of formed element emboli into the intracranial cerebral circulation downstream from severe internal carotid artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient ischemic attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIAs may be due to either low flow or embolization. When TIAs are due to low flow with inadequate collateral blood supply, they are brief, repetitive, stereotyped spells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. They often herald strokes occurring in the territory of the internal carotid artery.</p><p>In comparison, embolic TIAs are usually single and more prolonged, and the symptoms are related to the vascular territories involved. Most often, an embolic ischemic event related to carotid artery stenosis will produce symptoms referable to the middle cerebral artery territory, although the anterior cerebral artery can also be involved. Amaurosis fugax refers to transient monocular blindness caused by a small embolus to the ophthalmic artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Total carotid artery occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the internal carotid artery occludes completely, it can also cause low flow or embolic ischemic events depending upon the adequacy of collateral flow through the orbit and across the circle of Willis. The greatest risk of low flow TIA or stroke is at the time of occlusion; the risk diminishes after the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. There is, however, a phenomenon of delayed stroke, occurring many months after carotid occlusion, presumably due to propagation of thrombus or embolism from the distal portion of the clot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The apparent diagnosis of carotid occlusion by carotid Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in a symptomatic patient is a special clinical problem. This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of complete occlusion'</a>.)</p><p>The management of total carotid occlusion is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention for specific causes of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Carotid occlusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired vasoreactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alteration in cerebral hemodynamic function may be an important factor in the occurrence of symptoms and stroke in patients with carotid stenosis. The prognosis of patients with a stroke due to carotid occlusion may be related to collateral flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Moreover, symptomatic patients have more impaired cerebrovascular reserve compared to those who are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Impaired vasoreactivity is associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with a severe carotid stenosis or occlusion. Supporting evidence comes from a meta-analysis of nine studies with individual data from over 700 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Carbon dioxide reactivity was evaluated at baseline using transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral artery during a vasodilatory carbon dioxide challenge (hypercapnia or breath-holding), and patients were followed for a median of 750 days. Impaired carbon dioxide reactivity was associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke (hazard ratio 3.69, 95% CI 2.01-6.77), and the risk was similar comparing subgroups with symptomatic versus asymptomatic carotid stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PLAQUE MORPHOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various features of plaque morphology can be used to identify symptomatic risk. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaque ulceration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaque structure and composition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaque volume</p><p/><p>The utility of these features is limited by deficiencies in the technologies used to identify these abnormalities, eg, B-mode imaging, color flow Doppler, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and angiography, all of which have strengths and weaknesses, and correlate imperfectly with pathologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Noninvasive imaging modalities such as high resolution MRI and ultrasonography that target the inflammatory and thrombotic components of atherosclerotic plaque may allow improved risk assessment of carotid plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. However, the clinical utility of these methods remains unproven. Prospective data correlating plaque morphology with stroke risk are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/19,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque ulceration and rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accumulating evidence supports the notion that carotid plaque ulceration is associated with carotid origin stroke. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinicopathologic correlates'</a> below.) </p><p>In addition, the presence of ulceration has been linked to transcranial Doppler detection of downstream emboli. However, some earlier studies suggested that ulceration may not increase the risk of carotid symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Furthermore, ulceration is significantly more prevalent in plaques producing severe stenosis. Because symptomatic risk is related to the degree of stenosis, a relationship between ulceration and stroke risk may be explained on this basis alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Plaque rupture is often the precipitating event in acute coronary syndromes and a similar process may occur with carotid plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In one report of endarterectomy specimens from 19 symptomatic and 25 asymptomatic patients, plaque rupture was significantly more common in patients with symptoms (74 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of carotid plaques is not as well understood as that of coronary artery plaques, but similar processes are thought to be involved, and a number of factors appear to increase plaque vulnerability to rupture. These include morphologic features (eg, plaque geometry, fibrous cap thickness or thinning, neovascularization, smooth muscle cell proliferation, intraplaque hemorrhage, and endothelial erosion), biochemical mechanisms (eg, inflammation and oxidative stress), and local hemodynamic forces operating along the plaque (eg, wall sheer stress and local pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. Carotid plaque ulceration and rupture most often involves the upstream (proximal) shoulder of the plaque, where sheer stress is maximal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/30,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34</a>].</p><p>Oxidative stress, particularly peroxidation of low density lipoproteins that contain arachidonic and linoleic acid, plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis and may promote plaque instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Inflammation is probably another important contributor to plaque rupture. Studies in coronary artery plaques have shown that the immediate site of plaque rupture or erosion is marked by an active inflammatory process consisting of activated monocytes and macrophages and, to a lesser degree, T cells. With the use of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning, inflammation can be visualized noninvasively in carotid plaques; the degree of inflammation is significantly greater in symptomatic plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The possible clinical use of FDG-PET to target surgery to high risk plaques remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraplaque hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies suggest that intraplaque hemorrhage is an important marker of symptomatic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. As an example, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that the presence of intraplaque hemorrhage on MRI in 335 patients with symptomatic carotid disease was associated with a marked increase in the risk for recurrent ipsilateral cerebral ischemic events (odds ratio 12.2, 95% CI 5.5-27.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of intraplaque hemorrhage is increased in patients with carotid stenosis when patients are studied in close proximity to the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The diminishing prevalence of this finding with increasing time from symptoms is believed to represent indirect evidence that intraplaque hemorrhage is related to symptom production.</p><p>However, intraplaque hemorrhage is common in asymptomatic severe plaques and may be unrelated to the production of symptoms. In a series of 43 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, for example, examination of the removed plaques revealed no differences with respect to intraplaque hemorrhage or other parameters, between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Plaque volume may represent a more accurate marker of plaque evolution and symptomatic risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque emboli</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emboli in the carotid and intracranial circulations can be detected by ultrasound. Because of increased impedance, emboli produced an audible chirp and a visual signal on the velocity spectrum. Formed element emboli have been found in patients with cardiac disease and carotid stenosis and in those undergoing invasive vascular procedures, such as coronary artery bypass grafting, endarterectomy, and angioplasty. There is some evidence that an increased number of emboli in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis places these patients at higher risk of future symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinicopathologic correlates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data are available regarding clinical events and the corresponding histopathology of carotid plaques.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest reported series examined 269 carotid plaques obtained at endarterectomy from 0 to 30 months after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Plaques were classified as thrombotically active when associated with acute thrombus; immunohistochemical studies were used to assess inflammatory cells in the plaque caps. The prevalence of thrombotically active plaque was significantly greater in patients with ipsilateral stroke compared with patients who had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or patients who were asymptomatic (74 versus 35 versus 14 percent, respectively). Thrombotically active plaque associated with fibrous cap rupture was found in all 32 patients who had endarterectomy within two months of symptom onset. The prevalence of thrombotically active plaque decreased with increasing time from symptom onset to endarterectomy, but it was still present in 54 percent of plaques obtained 13 to 24 months after symptom onset. The prevalence of ruptured plaque associated with cap inflammation was significantly greater in patients who had stroke compared with patients who had TIA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study examined surgical carotid plaque specimens from 241 subjects enrolled in the NASCET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] or ACAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] endarterectomy trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Ulceration was more common in patients who were symptomatic (in plaques taken from either the ipsilateral or contralateral side) compared with plaques taken from patients without symptoms (36 versus 14 percent). In patients with ipsilateral symptoms, the presence of thrombus was significantly higher in ulcerated plaques compared with plaques lacking ulceration (44 versus 13 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'NASCET trial'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Endarterectomy trials'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third report looked at 100 patients with TIA or minor stroke and ipsilateral symptomatic mild (n = 39) or moderate (n = 61) carotid stenosis by ultrasound criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Patients with a moderate degree of carotid stenosis had a significantly higher prevalence of complicated plaque features on MRI, including intraplaque hemorrhage (49 versus 20 percent) and a thin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ruptured fibrous cap (62 versus 36 percent). In addition, patients with moderate stenosis had plaques with larger volumes of lipid-rich necrotic core (12 versus 7 percent of total vessel wall volume).</p><p/><p>Together, the results of these studies suggest that plaque ulceration, thrombosis, and inflammation are important in the pathogenesis of carotid origin stroke. Plaque thrombosis may remain active and provide a continual source of embolic material for many months after symptom onset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of carotid artery stenosis are a carotid bruit and symptoms of ischemia. Carotid stenosis may also exist in the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms. Classification of the symptomatic status of the artery is important to the neurologist in making diagnostic and treatment decisions. A history of more than one discrete episode occurring in the same carotid territory, especially the combination of ipsilateral ophthalmic and hemispheric events (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic symptoms'</a> below), is very suggestive of underlying carotid disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Carotid bruit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important sign of carotid stenosis is a carotid bruit heard over the site of the stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, a carotid bruit in asymptomatic patients is a poor predictor for the presence of an underlying carotid stenosis and for the subsequent development of stroke. Similarly, ocular bruits and abnormalities or asymmetries of facial pulses are not reliable predictors of carotid stenosis. These relationships can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 331 patients referred to a cerebrovascular clinic, one-third had carotid bruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Using carotid duplex ultrasonography, only 37 percent of these patients had a moderate or severe carotid stenosis compared to 17 percent without a bruit. The carotid arteries were normal in 32 percent of those with a bruit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective natural history studies of asymptomatic carotid artery bruits suggest that the rate of ipsilateral stroke increases dramatically when the residual lumen diameter narrows to greater than 70 percent stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66153\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66153 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. In one series of 500 patients, for example, the incidence of stroke was 1.7 percent per year over all but 5.5 percent per year in those with more than a 75 percent carotid artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), the presence of a carotid bruit was associated with a nonsignificant relative risk of 1.29 for stroke over a mean follow-up of 4.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Similar findings were noted in the Framingham Heart Study as an asymptomatic carotid bruit was associated with an approximate doubling of the expected stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, the stroke more often than not occurred in a vascular territory different from the carotid bruit, suggesting that a carotid bruit can act as a nonfocal marker of advanced atherosclerosis.</p><p/><p>The yield is higher in patients with symptomatic carotid disease. In a report from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) of patients with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease, carotid bruits alone were not sufficiently predictive of high-grade carotid stenosis to be useful in selecting patients for angiography; bruits were absent in over one-third of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, 75 percent of patients with a bruit had a moderate to severe stenosis (&ge;60 percent stenosis).</p><p>Some experienced clinicians believe that there are several characteristics of a carotid bruit, if they can be heard, that give an indication of the location and severity of the stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A focal bruit suggests an internal carotid artery stenosis, as opposed to a transmitted cardiac or aortic murmur</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high-pitched bruit suggests increased blood flow velocity in the region of arterial stenosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A long duration bruit in systole suggests a tighter stenosis</p><p/><p>These bruit characteristics are most often heard at the origin of the internal carotid artery when the stenosis is &ge;70 percent of the lumen diameter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the residual lumen diameter is &le;1.5 mm.

In addition to a reduction in vessel diameter induced by the enlarging plaque, thrombus can become superimposed on the atheroma. Thus, the mechanism of stroke may be embolism of the thrombotic material or low flow due to the stenosis with inadequate collateral compensation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient ischemic attacks may be due to either low flow or embolization. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transient ischemic attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the internal carotid artery occludes completely, it can also cause low flow or embolic ischemic events depending upon the adequacy of collateral flow through the orbit and across the circle of Willis. The greatest risk of low flow transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke is at the time of occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Total carotid artery occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various features of plaque morphology can be used to identify symptomatic risk. These include plaque ulceration, plaque structure and composition, and plaque volume. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Plaque morphology and pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of carotid artery stenosis are a carotid bruit and symptoms of ischemia. Carotid stenosis may also exist in the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms. A history of more than one discrete episode occurring in the same carotid territory, especially the combination of ipsilateral ophthalmic and hemispheric events, is very suggestive of underlying carotid disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20302029\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors of UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Philip Kistler, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">FISHER M.
