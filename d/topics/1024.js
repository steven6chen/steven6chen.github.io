In contrast, their benefit in the treatment of the primary disease processes of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis has not been well-established in carefully-designed clinical trials, although they are used commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The rationale for antibiotic therapy in IBD is based upon a large body of evidence demonstrating that luminal bacteria and perhaps fungi and viruses have an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment with antibiotics has the potential to influence the course of IBD by several mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreasing the concentrations of bacteria and fungi in the gut lumen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altering the composition of the intestinal microbiota to favor beneficial bacteria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreasing bacterial tissue invasion and treating microabscesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreasing bacterial translocation and systemic dissemination</p><p/><p>Some of the antibiotics that have been used to treat IBD may also act as immunomodulators and thereby exert their benefit by mechanisms other than their antimicrobial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, some antibiotic regimens have been designed to treat mycobacterial infection, which has been hypothesized to have a role in the development of Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal microbiota can also be accomplished with other strategies including prebiotics (ie, dietary components that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria) and probiotics (ie, beneficial bacteria). How these strategies might be used together in the treatment of IBD remains a topic of active investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probiotics-for-gastrointestinal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Probiotics for gastrointestinal diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review summarizes clinical trials of antibiotic treatment for IBD, focusing primarily on Crohn disease, which has been the subject of the greatest number of clinical studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CROHN DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Luminal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several controlled trials and observational studies in the treatment of active Crohn disease with antibiotics have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>]. Most were small (16 to 213 subjects), short-term (range 2 to 24 weeks), and have important methodologic limitations. Furthermore, these studies used different entry criteria, permitted use of various concomitant therapies, and focused on different endpoints, thus limiting direct comparisons between studies. However, in a 2011 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, antibiotics were superior to placebo for the induction of remission of active Crohn disease (RR of active disease not in remission 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, this meta-analysis found that antibiotics were more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission of Crohn disease (RR of relapse 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.96). In a 2012 meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials, antibiotic therapy was associated with an improvement in clinical symptoms as compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.16-1.58]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Clinical experience with antibiotics in the treatment of IBD has far outpaced published scientific evidence. The published literature and clinical experience considered together suggest a modest benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (10 or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> or the combination of metronidazole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> for primary or adjunctive therapy of colonic Crohn disease, but not for isolated small intestinal disease. Several other single and combination antibiotic regimens also appear to be effective, although there is somewhat less experience. However, many uncertainties remain, including the magnitude and duration of the benefit, the optimal dose and duration of therapy, and strategies to reduce adverse effects. Metronidazole in particular can be associated with permanent peripheral neuropathy when used for prolonged periods, especially at higher doses, and ciprofloxacin can rarely cause tendon rupture and has been linked with cartilage defects in fetal development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-an-overview#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metronidazole: An overview&quot;, section on 'Toxicity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoroquinolones#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluoroquinolones&quot;, section on 'Tendinopathy and tendon rupture'</a>.)</p><p>Most antibiotics only transiently alter luminal bacterial concentrations; bacteria repopulate the mucosa after therapy ceases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Antibiotics also promote proliferation of resistant strains, and broad spectrum agents can increase risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection. A study in new onset pediatric Crohn disease patients suggested that short-term use of antibiotics prior to diagnosis actually potentiated dysbiosis by decreasing putative protective bacterial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This study illustrates the need to carefully choose indications for antibiotic use and to prescribe three-month courses rather than short-term intervals when using antibiotics for primary or adjunctive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology#H402654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>One study demonstrated that chronic use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> eliminated Bacteroides species in patients with Crohn disease for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Furthermore, Bacteroides clearance was associated with disease remission suggesting that treatment of anaerobes is important. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> has poor anaerobic coverage, but may be effective in clearing <em>Escherichia coli</em>, which have been implicated in ileal Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p>In one report, the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> significantly decreased mucosally-associated bacteria after 1 and 7 to 14 days of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, mucosally associated bacteria rebounded to higher than pretreatment levels 1 to 18 weeks after antibiotic exposure ceased, but returned to pretreatment levels by six months after cessation of antibiotics. Neither Bacteroides<em> </em>nor Enterobacteriaceae (<em>E. coli</em>) groups were permanently suppressed.</p><p>Thus, the relationship between the bacterial targets of antimicrobial agents and therapeutic efficacy remains obscure. Whether results observed with specific antimicrobial agents can be generalized to others is uncertain.</p><p>The following summarizes the largest studies in which the patient populations, clinical endpoints, and interventions were best described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Metronidazole</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study included 105 patients with active disease who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> or placebo for 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only 56 patients completed the study. Withdrawals were due to deterioration of symptoms, adverse events, or protocol violations. Among those who completed the study, there was a significant decrease in the Crohn disease activity index, and a decrease in CRP with metronidazole therapy. However, there were no differences in remission rates between those receiving metronidazole or placebo. Patients with colonic involvement fared better than those with isolated ileal involvement, which has been a consistent finding in several studies. The high dropout rate in this study makes the results difficult to interpret, although the results suggest a benefit of this therapy for Crohn colitis and ileocolitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another trial included 78 patients with active disease who were randomly assigned to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> in a double-blind, cross-over study for two four-month periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

At the end of the study complete remission was observed in a similar proportion of patients (55 versus 56 percent, respectively).<br/><br/>These findings do not necessarily indicate that the two drugs are equivalent since the study was not designed to determine equivalence.

However, a subsequent, large (213 patients) placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a> for two years found no lasting benefit, although a significant improvement with antibiotics was seen at four months (66 percent remission on antibiotics versus 50 percent with placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antibiotics-for-treatment-of-inflammatory-bowel-diseases/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is likely that benefit was due to the effects of this treatment on commensal bacteria rather than <em>Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis</em> (MAP). Unfortunately, mucosal levels of MAP were not measured before and after therapy in this study.
