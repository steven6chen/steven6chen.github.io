Therapy for hyperkalemia due to potassium retention is ultimately aimed at inducing potassium loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In some cases, the primary problem is movement of potassium out of the cells, even though the total body potassium may be reduced. Redistributive hyperkalemia most commonly occurs in uncontrolled hyperglycemia (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state). In these disorders, hyperosmolality and insulin deficiency are primarily responsible for the transcellular shift of potassium from the cells into the extracellular fluid, which can be reversed by the administration of fluids and insulin. Many of these patients have a significant deficit in whole body potassium and must be monitored carefully for the development of hypokalemia during therapy.

The most serious manifestations of hyperkalemia are muscle weakness or paralysis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, slow idioventricular rhythms, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole. These manifestations usually occur when the serum potassium concentration is &ge;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> with chronic hyperkalemia, or possibly at lower levels in patients with an acute rise in serum potassium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> underlying cardiac conduction disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">There are several characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities associated with hyperkalemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109443\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109443 \">figure 1</a>). A tall peaked T wave with a shortened QT interval is the earliest change (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80441\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80441 \">waveform 1</a>), followed by progressive lengthening of the PR interval and QRS duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63569\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63569 \">waveform 2</a>). The P wave may disappear, and ultimately, the QRS widens further to a sine wave. Ventricular standstill with a flat line on the ECG ensues with complete absence of electrical activity. The progression and severity of ECG changes do not correlate well with the serum potassium concentration. Conduction abnormalities, such as bundle branch blocks and arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, slow idioventricular rhythms, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole) may also occur in hyperkalemia.

Tissue breakdown can release large amounts of potassium from cells, which can lead to rapid and substantial elevations in serum potassium. Potassium absorption from the blood in the gastrointestinal tract or soft tissues can produce similar rapid increases in the serum potassium. Patients with a non-gap acidosis or respiratory acidosis may develop severe hyperkalemia quickly if the acidosis worsens, or if they develop an additional superimposed metabolic or respiratory acidosis, particularly when renal function is impaired.

Measures such as isotonic bicarbonate infusion, intravenous 5 percent dextrose in water infusion overnight (to stimulate insulin in a fasting patient), or hemodialysis may be appropriate in these settings.

Such patients do not require urgent lowering of the serum potassium and can often be treated with dietary modification, use of diuretics (if otherwise appropriate), treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis, or reversal of factors that can cause hyperkalemia (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hypovolemia). In some instances, drugs that inhibit the RAAS are reduced or discontinued, and drugs that remove potassium by gastrointestinal cation exchange are prescribed for chronic use.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH A HYPERKALEMIC EMERGENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying patients who have a hyperkalemic emergency is presented above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F109740\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109740 \">algorithm 1</a>).

As discussed elsewhere, hyperkalemia-induced depolarization of the resting membrane potential leads to inactivation of sodium channels and decreased membrane excitability.

As a result, calcium should not be administered as monotherapy for hyperkalemia but should rather be combined with therapies that drive extracellular potassium into cells. Administration of calcium can be repeated every 30 to 60 minutes if the hyperkalemic emergency persists and the serum calcium does not become elevated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Insulin with glucose'</a> below.)</p><p>Calcium can be given as either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a>. Calcium chloride contains three times the concentration of elemental calcium compared with calcium gluconate (13.6 versus 4.6 mEq in 10 mL of a 10 percent solution). However, calcium gluconate is generally preferred because calcium chloride may cause local irritation at the injection site.</p><p>The usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> is 1000 mg (10 mL of a 10 percent solution) infused over two to three minutes, with constant cardiac monitoring. The usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> is 500 to 1000 mg (5 to 10 mL of a 10 percent solution), also infused over two to three minutes, with constant cardiac monitoring. The dose of either formulation can be repeated after five minutes if the ECG changes persist or recur.</p><p>Concentrated calcium infusions (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a>) are irritating to veins, and extravasation can cause tissue necrosis. As a result, a central or deep vein is preferred for administration of calcium chloride. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcium gluconate</a> can be given peripherally, ideally through a small needle or catheter in a large vein.

In such patients, a dilute solution can be administered slowly, infusing 10 mL of 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> in 100 mL of 5 percent dextrose in water over 20 to 30 minutes, to avoid acute hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with hyperkalemia due to digitalis toxicity, the administration of digoxin-specific antibody fragments is the preferred therapy.

Glucose is usually given with insulin to prevent the development of hypoglycemia. However, insulin should be given alone if the serum glucose is &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The serum glucose should be measured every hour for five to six hours after the administration of insulin, given the risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>One commonly used regimen for administering insulin and glucose is 10 to 20 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> in 500 mL of 10 percent dextrose, given intravenously over 60 minutes. Another regimen consists of a bolus injection of 10 units of regular insulin, followed immediately by 50 mL of 50 percent dextrose (25 g of glucose). This regimen may provide a greater early reduction in serum potassium since the potassium-lowering effect is greater at the higher insulin concentrations attained with bolus therapy. However, hypoglycemia occurs in up to 75 percent of patients treated with the bolus regimen, typically approximately one hour after the infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. To avoid this complication, we recommend subsequent infusion of 10 percent dextrose at 50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> and close monitoring of blood glucose levels every hour for five to six hours.</p><p>The administration of glucose without insulin is <strong>not</strong> recommended, since the release of endogenous insulin can be variable and the attained insulin levels are generally lower with a glucose infusion alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, in susceptible patients (primarily diabetic patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism), hypertonic glucose in the absence of insulin may acutely increase the serum potassium concentration by raising the plasma osmolality, which promotes water and potassium movement out of the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>The effect of insulin begins in 10 to 20 minutes, peaks at 30 to 60 minutes, and lasts for four to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/7,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12-14</a>].

In particular, although patients with renal failure are resistant to the glucose-lowering effect of insulin, they are not resistant to the hypokalemic effect, because Na-K-ATPase activity is still enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Hemodialysis can remove 25 to 50 mEq of potassium per hour, with variability based upon the initial serum potassium concentration, the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, the blood flow rate, the dialysate flow rate, the duration of dialysis, the potassium concentration of the dialysate, and the patient's muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p>One of the major determinants of the rate of potassium removal is the potassium gradient between the plasma and dialysate.

Thus, the serum potassium concentration should usually not be measured soon after the completion of hemodialysis, since the results are likely to be misleading.</p><p>The postdialysis rebound after hemodialysis is more pronounced in patients undergoing acute hemodialysis for hyperkalemia due to massive release of potassium from injured cells (eg, tumor lysis, rhabdomyolysis) and after regular maintenance hemodialysis in patients with a high predialysis serum potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Rapidly acting transient therapies given before dialysis, such as insulin with glucose or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, have a twofold effect: Total potassium removal is reduced due to lowering of the serum potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/43,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,52</a>]; and the potassium rebound is greater because of the wearing off of the effect of the transient therapies. The potassium rebound is also increased with a high-sodium dialysate since the increase in plasma osmolality creates a gradient for water and then potassium efflux from the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Patients who have a large postdialysis rebound may require daily dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy to avoid recurrent severe hyperkalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2686782473\"><span class=\"h3\">Those without severe renal impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have moderate hyperkalemia and either normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment can usually be managed without dialysis.

In patients with normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment, correcting the cause of hyperkalemia (eg, drugs, hypovolemia) will generally suffice, in addition to treatment with saline infusion and loop diuretics; a gastrointestinal cation exchanger is sometimes used in such patients.

With the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patiromer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">patiromer</a> and ZS-9, it is anticipated that gastrointestinal cation exchangers will be utilized more frequently in these patients for chronic control of the serum potassium.

In addition to a low-potassium diet, the following modalities have been effective in stable maintenance hemodialysis patients (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-potassium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid episodes of fasting, which can increase potassium movement out of the cells due, at least in part, to reduced insulin secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with moderate hyperkalemia, avoid, if possible, drugs that raise the serum potassium concentration.
