The treatment of telangiectasias and reticular veins with lasers or light therapy is reviewed here. Other modalities used to treat these entities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liquid-foam-and-glue-sclerotherapy-techniques-for-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-veins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liquid, foam, and glue sclerotherapy techniques for the treatment of lower extremity veins&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Telangiectasias, reticular veins, and varicose veins are the visible signs of chronic venous disease and can occur in the presence or absence of either symptoms or an underlying functional venous disorder (reflux) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice for the majority of superficial leg veins. When sclerotherapy is administered sequentially from deep to superficial and from larger to smaller veins, over 90 percent of vessels can be successfully treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Candidates for laser and light therapy are those who do not tolerate or fail sclerotherapy or who have small superficial vessels that are too small to cannulate with a sclerotherapy needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In the absence of signs of venous reflux, laser and light therapy can be performed after physical examination. The clinical evaluation of the patient with chronic venous disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because vein recurrence rates are increased in the presence of superficial venous reflux, reflux is managed prior to treatment. Treatment with laser and light therapy is most effective for small vessels (1 to 2 mm in diameter), although vessels up to 5 mm in diameter can be treated. Larger veins do not respond as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].

Pregnant patients should defer until after delivery.</p><p>Diabetes and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (ankle-brachial index &lt;0.9) are also contraindications because these conditions are associated with an increased risk of nonhealing wounds.</p><p>In addition, laser and light therapy may cause hyperpigmentation, which is usually temporary but can last up to a year, and hypopigmentation, which may be permanent. Both these side effects are most common in patients with tan skin and in Fitzpatrick skin types III, IV, V, and VI. A test spot is undertaken prior to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Pigmentation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to offer laser or light therapy depends upon symptoms, extent of lower extremity disease, patient expectations, and likelihood of providing a durable benefit either with respect to appearance or improvement in symptoms. </p><p>Patients should be counseled carefully prior to treatment. The patient is informed that veins will lighten and become less noticeable but may not completely disappear. Multiple treatments are typically required to achieve the desired effect, and alteration in skin pigmentation can occur.</p><p>For all patients, it is important to address patient expectations and potential complications and to document veins photographically prior to each treatment. These photographs should be reviewed with the patient periodically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LASER/LIGHT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lasers emit a single, coherent wavelength of light, while intense pulsed light (IPL) sources emit white light from 515 to 1200 nm that is usually filtered to certain broad wavelengths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69001 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Laser therapy of venous structures is based on the concept of selective photothermolysis (ie, selective thermal confinement of light-induced damage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Pulsed lasers and light sources heat the target tissue, inducing thermal injury with limited damage to the surrounding structures. The wavelength of light is chosen based upon the chromophore (the part of a molecule responsible for its color) of the target structure and the depth of the vessel. The oxyhemoglobin contained within red blood cells has three major absorption peaks at 418, 542, and 577 nm, with an additional infrared absorption around 1000 nm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63932\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63932 \">figure 2</a>). Green, yellow, and infrared laser and light sources are effectively absorbed by leg veins. </p><p>The selected duration of the light pulse determines the size of the vessel that will respond to treatment. Shorter pulses selectively heat smaller vessels (&lt;2 mm), and longer pulse duration light sources are effective for slightly larger vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other parameters, such as fluence (energy density), spot size, and cooling are also important factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-medical-lasers#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of medical lasers&quot;, section on 'Tissue ablation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LASER AND LIGHT SOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single laser type is used to treat the variety of vascular abnormalities seen in clinical practice. The specific laser selected for an individual patient depends upon the size and depth of the vessels to be treated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80164 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patient skin phototype is also important (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse dye laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse dye lasers (PDLs) emit light at 585 and 595 nm at pulse durations of 0.45 to 40 msecs. The yellow wavelength matches the third oxyhemoglobin peak (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77528 \">figure 3</a>). PDLs are most effective for treating small lower extremity veins less than 1.5 mm in diameter in light skin type patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80164 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium titanyl phosphate laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) lasers emit light at 532 nm at pulse durations in the millisecond range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77528 \">figure 3</a>). The green wavelength matches the second oxyhemoglobin peak overlapping the absorption peak of melanin. Veins with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mm can be effectively treated in light skin type patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80164 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diode laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diode lasers emit light at a single wavelength between 800 and 900 nm, penetrating more deeply and with less absorption by melanin than PDL and KTP lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Veins up to 4 mm in diameter can be treated using this laser (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77528 \">figure 3</a>). Diode lasers with a 900 nm wavelength have been used in conjunction with radiofrequency current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The combination is an effective treatment for lower extremity veins. The diode laser can also be augmented with intravenous injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a>, which enhances light absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This longer wavelength penetrates to deeper levels and, with long pulse durations, can be used to treat veins from 0.3 to 3 mm in diameter. Because of lower absorption in pigment, Nd:YAG lasers are less likely to cause pigmentary changes and are safer to use in darker skin types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80164 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Alexandrite laser</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alexandrite lasers emit light at a wavelength of 755 nm with a pulse duration in the millisecond range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77528 \">figure 3</a>). The wavelength corresponds to absorption by deoxygenated hemoglobin but also to absorption by melanin.

The use of eye protection is essential, and when operating class 4 lasers (includes most medical lasers), it is required in the workplace by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Detailed treatment parameters for each of the devices listed above are beyond the scope of this topic but can be found in specialty reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The parameters for treatment are entered into the <span class=\"nowrap\">laser/light</span> control panel, and treatment proceeds by first cooling the skin over the vessels and then activating the <span class=\"nowrap\">laser/light</span> over the target vessel(s). The patient will feel anything from a very mild sting to a strong pinching and burning sensation when the laser is activated. The application of a topical anesthetic agent can be used to lessen pain. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Adverse reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>A visible clearing of the vein should be seen, but if not, the vessel can be treated again or the laser parameters adjusted to improve the effect. To avoid burns, no more than three attempts should be tried over the same area of skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No dressings are needed. Application of compression bandages is suggested by some, but not all, practitioners. The patient may return to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> normal daily activities immediately, including work. There is no evidence that avoiding exercise leads to better results. Patients should avoid sun exposure to the treated areas. Alternatively, sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF 30) may be applied to the treated areas.</p><p>Vessels may need more than one treatment to achieve optimum results, and repeat therapy is generally performed within four to six weeks. There is some evidence, at least with long pulsed Nd:YAG lasers, that waiting eight weeks between treatments yields more improvement per treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common local reactions associated with laser therapy include pain, redness, swelling, bruising, and itching.

Another study directly compared sclerotherapy using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polidocanol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polidocanol</a> with laser (1064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet [Nd-YAG]) for the treatment of leg telangiectasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-and-light-therapy-of-lower-extremity-telangiectasias-reticular-veins-and-small-varicose-veins/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A blinded assessment of the outcomes of treatment found a high (&gt;70 percent) and equal improvement after either treatment. However, the 1064-nm long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatment was associated with more pain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser therapy of telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins is generally considered a cosmetic treatment and is not typically covered by insurance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated veins can occur in the presence or absence of either symptoms or an underlying functional venous disorder. Telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins can cause symptoms and are often a source of significant distress to the patient even in the absence of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, or small varicose veins in the lower extremities may indicate an underlying functional venous disorder, especially when associated with symptoms (aching, swelling, heaviness). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients with lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, or small varicose veins should undergo further evaluation with venous duplex to identify the presence of superficial or deep venous insufficiency, which alters treatment options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy is the only option for treatment of telangiectasias too small to access with a needle, patients allergic to sclerosing agents or afraid of needles, or those who have failed sclerotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest laser therapy over sclerotherapy for treatment of telangiectatic matting resulting from either prior sclerotherapy or saphenous ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Laser versus sclerotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We avoid laser therapy of lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, or small varicose veins in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types III, IV, V, and VI due to the risk of hypopigmentation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Adverse reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common local adverse reactions to laser treatment include pain, bruising, altered skin pigmentation, and telangiectatic matting. The incidence of these reactions depends upon the <span class=\"nowrap\">laser/light</span> modality chosen and patient skin type. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Adverse reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of the neodymium-doped: yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser over other laser types for the treatment of most lower extremity telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small varicose veins (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The Nd:YAG laser is effective for treatment over a wider range of vein diameters and depths with fewer adverse reactions.
