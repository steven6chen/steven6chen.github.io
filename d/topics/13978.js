The data demonstrating these associations, as well as the potential mechanisms, will be reviewed here. The approach to patients who present with concurrent hypertension and hypokalemia, and the clinical features of primary aldosteronism, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">POTASSIUM INTAKE AND BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of potassium intake can affect blood pressure. The effect varies with the direction (low potassium intake raises the blood pressure, and high potassium intake lowers the blood pressure) and magnitude of change in potassium intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355188390\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-potassium diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low dietary potassium intake (below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> [1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day])</span> has been associated with an elevation in blood pressure and an <strong>increased</strong> risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>], as well as an increase in risk of chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following observations are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two different studies, one in healthy normotensive men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and one in patients with primary hypertension (formerly called essential hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], potassium restriction from a normal intake of 80 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> down to 10 to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> led to a statistically significant 4 to 5 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure may have been mediated in part by sodium retention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies and nearly 250,000 individuals, a 1.64 g (42 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol)/day</span> higher potassium intake was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to the adverse effects of low dietary potassium intake, the ratio of dietary sodium-to-potassium intake can also influence blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a report from the Dallas Heart Study, each three-unit <strong>increase</strong> in the urine sodium-to-potassium ratio, which can reflect increased sodium intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduced potassium intake, was associated with a 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/1</span> mmHg elevation in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A higher sodium-to-potassium intake ratio is also associated with an increase in overall cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355188396\"><span class=\"h2\">High-potassium diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the rise in blood pressure associated with a low-potassium diet, potassium supplementation lowers the blood pressure significantly in hypertensive patients and insignificantly in normotensive patients. The magnitude of change has been illustrated in systematic reviews that included meta-analyses of both randomized trials and cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. The following findings were noted in the larger of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials in hypertensive patients, increased potassium intake significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by a mean of 5.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/3</span>.1 mmHg. By contrast, the reduction in blood pressure was small (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/0</span>.6 mmHg) and not statistically significant in three trials in normotensive subjects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a subgroup analysis was performed according to achieved potassium intake, patients with an increase to 90 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> had the largest reduction in blood pressure (7.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/4</span>.1 mmHg).</p><p/><p>In another meta-analysis, the effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure was <strong>greater</strong> in blacks than in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Urinary potassium excretion in blacks is consistently less than in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. This difference is due in part to less dietary potassium intake in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>In addition to the lower rate of potassium intake, another factor that may contribute to the increased predisposition to hypertension in blacks is a relative increase in the activity of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the luminal membrane in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This defect could contribute to the decreased plasma renin activity, lower rate of urinary potassium excretion, and increased salt sensitivity often seen in blacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9649910\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical implications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the above observations, it has been proposed that hypertensive patients with normal or near-normal renal function should be encouraged to maintain a high potassium intake from fresh fruits and vegetables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Dietary counseling is the usual approach to increasing potassium intake.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Potassium chloride</a> supplements can also be used, particularly if the serum potassium concentration is low. However, if there is no apparent cause for the hypokalemia (eg, diuretic therapy, gastrointestinal losses), the patient should be evaluated for the disorders that are associated with both hypertension and hypokalemia. These include primary aldosteronism, renovascular disease, and Cushing's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H27627359\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>Few Americans achieve the recommended level of potassium intake. In a report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, the average daily potassium intake in adults was 74 to 82 mEq (2.9 to 3.2 g) in men and 54 to 59 mEq (2.1 to 2.3 g) in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Only 10 percent of men and less than 1 percent of women had a daily potassium intake of 120 mEq (4.7 g) or more.</p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> recommend potassium supplementation or a high-potassium diet to attain these goals in patients at risk for hyperkalemia due, for example, to therapy with angiotensin inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, or underlying chronic kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several mechanisms by which potassium intake affects hypertension and vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>]. In particular, low potassium intake may reduce sodium excretion due in part to effects of potassium deficiency on the activity of the WNK (With-No-Lysine) kinase pathway, resulting in activation of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Conversely, high potassium intake increases sodium excretion. Potassium &quot;sensing&quot; via basolateral potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels in the distal convoluted tubule plays a key role in these pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to sodium excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between potassium and blood pressure appears to be due in part to changes in sodium excretion, as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sodium excretion is diminished by hypokalemia or a low-potassium diet and increased with potassium supplements, apparently through changes in sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Potassium intake and blood pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemia-induced-renal-dysfunction#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemia-induced renal dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Increased sodium reabsorption'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of chloride intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chloride is an important determinant of the rise in blood pressure in salt-sensitive forms of hypertension. By comparison, dietary potassium (eg, from fruits and vegetables) is primarily associated with organic anions such as citrate, not chloride. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salt intake, salt restriction, and primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relative efficacy of potassium bicarbonate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-citrate-tablet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium citrate</a> (citrate is metabolized to bicarbonate) supplements and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> supplements has been directly evaluated in randomized crossover trials of patients with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potassium-and-hypertension/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The bicarbonate, citrate, and chloride preparation all produced a similar reduction in blood pressure. Thus, the available evidence does <strong>not</strong> support the accompanying anion being important in the effect of potassium on blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of adequate potassium intake or the administration of potassium supplements usually lowers the blood pressure, particularly in blacks and in patients who are not sodium restricted. Furthermore, a higher potassium intake reduces the risk of stroke. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Potassium intake and blood pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Relation to sodium excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism by which potassium reduces blood pressure is not clear. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some experts suggest that hypertensive patients should consume at least 120 mEq (4.7 g) of dietary <span class=\"nowrap\">potassium/day</span> provided they do not have a predisposition to hyperkalemia.
