It is characterized by a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms that includes abdominal distention and discomfort, enlarged ovaries, ascites, and other complications of enhanced vascular permeability. The syndrome can be strictly defined as the shift of serum from the intravascular space to the third space, mainly to the abdominal cavity, in the context of enlarged ovaries due to follicular stimulation. In its very severe form, OHSS is a life-threatening condition.</p><p>The prevention of OHSS will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and management of established OHSS are discussed separately.

OHSS is an iatrogenic and potentially life-threatening condition that affects young, healthy women. In addition, there is an important economic burden associated with OHSS due to absence from work, bed rest, or hospitalization and intensive medical management of severe cases. </p><p>The pathophysiology of OHSS is not fully understood, but increased capillary permeability with the resulting loss of fluid into the third space is its main feature (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&quot;</a>). In the susceptible patient, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration for final follicular maturation and triggering of ovulation is the pivotal stimulus for OHSS, leading to overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the ovary, release of vasoactive-angiogenic substances, increased vascular permeability, loss of fluid to the third space, and full-blown OHSS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66510 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>There are two clinical forms of OHSS, both hCG related: the <strong>early-onset</strong> form (occurring in the first eight days after hCG administration) and the <strong>late-onset</strong> form (occurring nine or more days after hCG administration, related to pregnancy-induced hCG production) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Therefore, in patients at risk, the starting dose of gonadotropins should be decreased (to 100 to 150 international units) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The current approach to ovarian stimulation emphasizes an approach to dosing based upon patient variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), baseline serum anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone concentrations, antral follicle count, and previous ovarian response. This approach typically uses lower doses than fixed ovarian stimulation protocols.</p><p>A clinical trial based upon this approach reported that clinical pregnancy rates were similar with a standard and individualized approach, but that the cancellation and OHSS rates were lower with the individualized approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of note, there is currently no consensus on the ideal dosing approach that optimizes pregnancy rates yet minimizes OHSS risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to dose, the type of gonadotropin preparation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menotropins-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">human menopausal gonadotropins</a> [hMG] versus recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone [rFSH] versus urinary follicle-stimulating hormone [uFSH]) does not appear to affect the risk of OHSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119223168\"><span class=\"h4\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest monitoring patients using both transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) (for follicular number and size) and serum E2 concentrations. Since multiple follicle development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and high E2 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] are important risk factors, early detection of either helps prevent OHSS by withholding the ovulatory dose of hCG in high-risk cycles.</p><p>One meta-analysis of eight studies of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) concluded that TVUS alone was adequate for patient monitoring, as clinical pregnancy and OHSS rates were similar in women monitored with TVUS alone or TVUS combined with serum E2 monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the overall quality of the evidence was low. Given the potential risks and important consequences of OHSS, we continue to suggest monitoring with both TVUS and serum E2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5388434\"><span class=\"h3\">Addition of GnRH agonist or antagonist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of controlled ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins for IVF, a GnRH agonist or antagonist is also administered to prevent the endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. hCG is then given to induce final oocyte maturation prior to oocyte retrieval, when follicles are judged to be mature based upon size and serum E2 concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation'</a>.) </p><p>We suggest the use of GnRH antagonists rather than GnRH agonists in women at high risk for OHSS. The use of GnRH agonists is associated with a higher incidence of OHSS, probably due to enhanced follicular recruitment. In contrast, prospective randomized trials and two meta-analyses have reported a lower incidence of OHSS when GnRH antagonists are used, including in women with PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/17-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-24</a>]. However, these same analyses suggest that the use of GnRH antagonists may result in lower pregnancy rates when compared with GnRH agonist therapy.</p><p>The use of GnRH antagonists followed by a GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation for women donating oocytes is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H119223203\" class=\"local\">'GnRH agonist trigger'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210635783\"><span class=\"h3\">Coasting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coasting refers to withholding gonadotropin therapy while continuing pituitary suppression with a GnRH agonist or antagonist until serum E2 levels fall into a range acceptable for hCG administration (eg, associated with a lower OHSS risk). This approach is less common now because of the availability of GnRH antagonists. The larger follicles can continue their growth and maturation when follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is stopped; the smaller follicles have a greater FSH requirement and therefore undergo atresia. Although we agree with trying this approach in high-risk cycles, available data are conflicting on its impact on preventing OHSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>We typically start coasting when the dominant follicles are &ge;16 mm and serum E2 levels are &gt;3500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (12,850 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Once initiated, daily TVUS and serum E2 measurements should be performed; administration of hCG should be withheld until serum E2 falls below 3500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (12,850 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span>. Coasting for greater than three days (but not up to three days) has a modest adverse effect on pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, we consider cycle cancellation if E2 levels have not fallen by the fourth day of coasting.</p><p>Based on one review, this approach results in an acceptably low incidence of severe OHSS (&lt;2 percent) with satisfactory fertilization and pregnancy rates (55 to 71 and 37 to 63 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1210635933\"><span class=\"h3\">Withholding hCG (cycle cancellation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cycle cancellation before administration of exogenous hCG is an effective strategy to prevent OHSS, ie, postponing the treatment cycle until the ovaries have been rendered quiescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, cycle cancellation has financial and emotional implications, frustrates both patient and clinician, and results in cancellation of a high percentage of cycles that would not have progressed to clinical OHSS. For patients undergoing agonist cycles at high-risk for severe OHSS, this approach is still a valid and safe alternative that prevents both early and late-onset OHSS forms. As noted, we consider cycle cancellation if E2 levels have not fallen by the fourth day of coasting. (See <a href=\"#H1210635783\" class=\"local\">'Coasting'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87937938\"><span class=\"h3\">Pretreatment with metformin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> pretreatment for women with PCOS undergoing IVF. Metformin is an antidiabetic drug that has been extensively investigated in the management of PCOS. Its indications in the management of PCOS have diminished, but it does appear to be useful for pretreatment prior to controlled ovarian stimulation prior to IVF for reducing the risk of OHSS.</p><p>In two studies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> pretreatment beginning four to five weeks before starting gonadotropin therapy for IVF reduced the risk of OHSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eight trials (n = 798 women), metformin pretreatment decreased the risk of OHSS when compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.18-0.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The authors calculated that for a woman with a 27 percent risk of having OHSS without metformin, the corresponding chance using metformin treatment would be between 6 and 15 percent. Similar results were seen in a second meta-analysis of 10 trials of over 800 women; metformin pretreatment reduced the risk of OHSS (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No difference in live birth rate was seen with metformin compared with placebo in either meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1379633520\"><span class=\"h3\">Luteal phase support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> regimens over hCG regimens for luteal phase support because they are associated with a lower risk of OHSS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;, section on 'Luteal phase support'</a>). Progesterone supplementation is generally initiated on the day of oocyte retrieval or at the time of embryo transfer. An alternative approach has been to administer intermittent, low doses of hCG. In a meta-analysis of seven trials comparing luteal phase progesterone and hCG regimens, the risk of OHSS was significantly lower with progesterone (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779501539\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovulatory triggers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1379632362\"><span class=\"h3\">Low versus standard-dose hCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>hCG, which mimics the LH surge, is the standard drug administered for inducing final oocyte maturation. As noted, it is thought to be the pivotal stimulus for OHSS; if withheld, the most severe types of OHSS do not occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F100371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100371 \">table 1</a>). The effect of hCG is related to its high biological activity, which is six to seven times that of endogenous LH (because of hCG&rsquo;s longer half-life) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In patients at risk, it had been assumed that <strong>lower</strong> doses of hCG would be associated with lower risks of OHSS by decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by granulosa cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Evidence to date, including a retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], suggests that lowering the dose of hCG to as low as 2500 to 3300 international units results in successful oocyte maturation with similar fertilization and pregnancy rates as doses of 5000 or 10,000 international units. However, it is not clear that the risk of OHSS is reduced, because both the studies and the number of cases are small.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1301594667\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant LH/recombinant hCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of OHSS appears to be similar with recombinant LH (rLH), recombinant hCG (rhCG) and urinary hCG. Recombinant hCG is a purer preparation of hCG that can be administered subcutaneously, as opposed to urinary hCG which is administered intramuscularly. The risk of OHSS appears to be similar with the two preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The biologic half-life of rLH is approximately 10 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of urinary hCG preparations (24 to 36 hours). Therefore, it had been thought that the risk of OHSS may be lower with rLH. However, pooled data from three trials comparing rLH and urinary hCG showed no difference in achieving final follicular maturation in IVF, with similar pregnancy and OHSS rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119223203\"><span class=\"h3\">GnRH agonist trigger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In GnRH antagonist cycles, the administration of a GnRH agonist at the end of ovarian stimulation induces an endogenous rise in both LH and FSH concentrations and effectively triggers oocyte maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. This is a useful approach in high-risk patients, preventing both early and late forms of OHSS. In a meta-analysis of 13 studies that assessed fresh autologous IVF cycles and four that assessed donor-recipient cycles, the use of GnRH agonist, when compared with hCG for final oocyte maturation, lowered the risk of OHSS but had a negative impact on live birth rates in the autologous IVF group but not the donor-recipient cycles. We therefore suggest this approach in oocyte donors, a group of healthy young women in whom minimizing OHSS risk is a particularly high priority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In IVF patients, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> 0.5 to 1 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> 0.1 to 0.2 mg subcutaneously. We agree with the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada who suggest using a GnRH antagonist protocol that includes a GnRH agonist as a substitute for hCG for final oocyte maturation in two settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women at high risk for OHSS (development of multiple follicles during ovarian stimulation [&gt;20 follicles over 10 mm]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101682\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101682 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women undergoing ovarian stimulation who plan to donate oocytes to recipients, or women undergoing fertility preservation cycles (eg, women planning to freeze their oocytes or embryos for future use)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450078794\"><span class=\"h2\">Other interventions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119223210\"><span class=\"h3\">In vitro oocyte maturation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro maturation (IVM) is an <strong>experimental</strong> technique that consists of the in vitro conversion of oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage to oocytes at the metaphase II stage.

Initial studies with IVM resulted in low fertilization rates and suboptimal embryonic quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, preliminary studies in women with PCOS suggest that IVM is associated with a lower OHSS rate but also a lower live birth rate than IVF using a GnRH antagonist protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

Observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>] and one prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] suggest that elective cryopreservation prevents severe OHSS and that embryo replacement in subsequent natural cycles results in good pregnancy rates. In contrast, in a review of two clinical trials of embryo cryopreservation (one compared with intravenous albumin therapy and one compared with fresh embryo transfer), no differences were observed between groups in the incidence of OHSS, pregnancy rates, or live birth rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Although data are conflicting, we currently suggest embryo cryopreservation in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at risk for OHSS (&gt;20 follicles larger than 10 mm) who received a GnRH agonist trigger. In these patients, the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> OHSS is virtually zero, but implantation rates are lower due to impairment of endometrial receptivity. Until luteal support is well established for these cases, cryopreservation of all <span class=\"nowrap\">oocytes/embryos</span> is the best approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at high risk for OHSS who received hCG. Those patients should have their <span class=\"nowrap\">oocytes/embryos</span> cryopreserved to avoid pregnancy and late OHSS. They are still at risk for early OHSS, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonists should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H119223238\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119223224\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not suggest the routine use of intravenous albumin or other volume expanders for the prevention of OHSS. The potential mechanism of action of prophylactic intravenous fluids is to increase plasma oncotic pressure, maintain intravascular volume, and bind to and inactivate ovarian mediators (eg, VEGF) involved in the development of OHSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials of human intravenous albumin versus placebo, there was only a borderline statistically significant decrease in the incidence of severe OHSS with albumin (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99).</p><p>These results are consistent with two previously published meta-analyses, both of which found no significant benefit of intravenous albumin for reducing the occurrence of severe OHSS in high-risk women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. In one analysis, pregnancy rates were lower in women receiving albumin compared with no treatment (relative risk [RR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Thus, we do not suggest this approach as there is no evidence of benefit and a possible negative impact on pregnancy rates.</p><p>A second volume expander, hydroxyethyl starch, was associated with a reduction in OHSS rates compared with placebo in three trials (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.40), but the safety of this product has not been well established.</p><p>Intravenous albumin has also been used for intravenous hydration in the management of severe OHSS. However, available evidence suggests that intravenous albumin provides no additional benefit when compared with crystalloid solutions.
