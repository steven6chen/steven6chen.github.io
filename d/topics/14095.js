It usually happens during the second half of pregnancy (after 20 weeks). It can also happen during labor or after the baby is born.</p><p>Women with preeclampsia have high blood pressure. They might also have too much protein in their urine, or problems with organs like the liver, kidneys, brain, eyes, or placenta. (The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste.) Plus, the baby might not grow well and be small.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482015\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with preeclampsia do not feel any different than usual. Preeclampsia usually does not cause symptoms unless it is severe. Signs and symptoms of severe preeclampsia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bad headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in vision: blurry vision, flashes of light, spots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain, especially in the upper belly</p><p/><p>If you have any of these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse. You might not have preeclampsia, because these symptoms can also occur in normal pregnancies. But it's important that your doctor knows about them.</p><p>You should also call your doctor or nurse if you have bleeding from the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482022\"><span class=\"h1\">How might preeclampsia affect my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preeclampsia can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow the growth of the baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease the amount of amniotic fluid around the baby (amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds and protects the baby in the uterus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p>You should call your doctor or nurse if your baby is not moving as much as usual. Your doctor or nurse will do tests to check for any problems with the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482029\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for preeclampsia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To test for preeclampsia, your doctor or nurse will take your blood pressure and check your urine for protein during pregnancy. He or she might also do blood tests to make sure your organs are working as they should.</p><p>When your doctor or nurse tells you your blood pressure, he or she will say 2 numbers. For instance, your doctor or nurse might say that your blood pressure is &quot;140 over 90.&quot; To be diagnosed with preeclampsia, your top number (called &quot;systolic pressure&quot;) must be 140 or higher, or your bottom number (called &quot;diastolic pressure&quot;) must be 90 or higher. Plus, you must have too much protein in your urine <strong>or</strong> problems with 1 or more of your organs.</p><p>It is possible to have high blood pressure (above <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90)</span> during pregnancy without having high protein in the urine or other problems. That is not preeclampsia. Still, if you develop high blood pressure, your doctor will watch you closely. You could develop preeclampsia or other problems related to high blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482036\"><span class=\"h1\">How is preeclampsia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For preeclampsia that develops during pregnancy, the only cure is to deliver the baby. Your doctor or nurse will decide whether it is better for you to have your baby right away, or to wait.</p><p>If you are near your due date, your doctor will probably give you medicine to start contractions. This is called &quot;inducing labor.&quot; Most women are able to give birth the usual way, through the vagina. But in some cases the doctor will need to do a C-section. A C-section, or &quot;cesarean delivery,&quot; is a type of surgery used to get the baby out of the uterus.</p><p>If your due date is not for several weeks, and your preeclampsia is not severe, your doctor or nurse might wait to deliver your baby. This is to give the baby more time to grow and develop. If your doctor or nurse decides to wait, he or she will check you and your baby often for any problems. You might need to stay in the hospital.</p><p>If your blood pressure is very high, your doctor or nurse might give you medicine to lower blood pressure. This is to keep you from having a stroke.</p><p>Women with preeclampsia can sometimes have seizures. Your doctor or nurse will probably give you medicine during labor to prevent this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482043\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to prevent preeclampsia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can't do anything to keep from getting preeclampsia. The most important thing you can do is to keep all the appointments you have with your doctor, nurse, or midwife. That way, they can find out as soon as possible if your blood pressure goes up, or if you have too much protein in your urine or any other problems. Also, call someone on your health care team right away if you have symptoms of preeclampsia or the baby isn't moving as much as usual. Your doctor or nurse can do things to keep you from having worse problems from preeclampsia.</p><p>If you are at high risk for preeclampsia, your doctor might tell you to take low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> during your second and third trimesters of pregnancy (after 12 weeks). You might be at high risk if you have had preeclampsia before and your baby was born early, if you are pregnant with twins, or if you have high blood pressure even when you are not pregnant. Your doctor can tell you if you are at high risk.</p><p>Do not take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or other medicines unless your doctor or nurse tells you it's safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482050\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HELLP syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=edema-swelling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Edema (swelling) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
