It happens when the body's infection-fighting system (called the &quot;immune system&quot;) attacks glands that keep the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body moist.</p><p>Some people with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome have other immune system conditions. These include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and scleroderma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74095186\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms are dry eyes and dry mouth. Dry eye symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes that feel dry or burn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sandy or gritty feeling in the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red or watery eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p/><p>If you have a dry mouth, you might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wake up at night to drink water because your mouth is so dry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to drink liquids to help swallow dry foods</p><p/><p>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome can also affect other parts of the body. Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry, itchy skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint or muscle pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems urinating, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinating more often than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Getting up a lot at night to urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Needing to urinate suddenly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal dryness &ndash; This can make sex painful.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74095201\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will learn about your symptoms and do an exam. You might also have the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye tests &ndash; To check if your eyes are making a normal amount of tears. If not, this could be a sign of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. An eye doctor called an &quot;ophthalmologist&quot; does these tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests &ndash; To check for diseases that people with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome often have, or other conditions that could be causing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;biopsy&quot; &ndash; In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from inside your lower lip. Another doctor looks at it under a microscope for signs of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; This test uses special magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors can use it to look at the saliva glands in your mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74095218\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dry eye treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye ointments and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">artificial tears</a> &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will help you decide which ones are best for you. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicated eye drops &ndash; Your doctor might prescribe these if they are right for you. Unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">artificial tears</a>, these contain medicine and are not available without a prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called &quot;punctal occlusion&quot; &ndash; In this procedure, an ophthalmologist puts tiny plugs in the tubes that normally drain tears from the eye. This can help with dry eyes by keeping tears on the eye longer.</p><p/><p>Dry mouth treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sprays and lozenges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescription medicines you take by mouth</p><p/><p>Other treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve other symptoms of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome or problems it can cause. For example, if you have joint pain, you can try <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that partly &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74095233\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sip water, chew sugarless gum, or suck sugar-free candy to help with dry mouth. If you don't like drinking a lot of water, you can rinse your mouth and spit the water out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put lip balm on dry lips and moisturizer on dry skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid excess air conditioning or heating. Use a humidifier in your bedroom and other places where you spend a lot of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use &quot;moisture chambers&quot; if your doctor or nurse suggests them. Moisture chambers are devices that fit on your glasses. They can help keep your eyes moist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82900 \">picture 1</a>). You can buy them at most stores that sell glasses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brush and floss your teeth after every meal, and see your dentist as often as your doctor or nurse tells you. Dry mouth raises the risk of cavities and some other mouth problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74095248\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you need surgery, make sure the doctor who gives you anesthesia (called an &quot;anesthesiologist&quot;) knows you have Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome. Having Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome can increase the risk of certain problems during surgery. Knowing you have Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome helps doctors do things to lower the risk of problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74095265\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dry eye (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fibromyalgia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-scleroderma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Systemic scleroderma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sjogrens-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
