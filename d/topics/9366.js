Hyperimmune globulins refer to products made from plasma with a high titer of the desired antibody. Some hyperimmune products are derived from immunized animals (eg, equine products) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-antitoxin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphtheria antitoxin</a> or snake anti-venoms. These products are much more likely to have adverse reactions and are outside the scope of this topic review.</p><p>Products for intravenous use are referred to as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) by clinicians and as &quot;IGIV&quot; by industry and regulatory agencies.</p><p>Other human <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> preparations include intramuscular immune globulin (IMIG, IGIM), also called intramuscular immune serum globulin (IM ISG), and subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG; IGSC, SC ISG). Adverse effects of IMIG and SCIG are discussed separately; these are generally similar (but less frequent and milder) to those with IVIG, with the exception of local reactions at the administration site, which are more of an issue with the intramuscular and subcutaneous routes than with IVIG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy#H759047119\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;, section on 'Adverse reactions of SCIG'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H656348\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse reactions to IVIG are reported to occur in up to 5 to 15 percent of all IVIG infusions and to affect 20 to 50 percent of individuals receiving IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].<strong> </strong>Adverse reactions are uncommon in patients receiving IVIG on a regular schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. Most of these reactions are mild, transient, reversible events such as headache, chills, or flushing. Potentially serious reactions occur in 2 to 6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Product information for available products includes a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of thrombosis, renal dysfunction, and acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The risk of adverse reactions generally correlates with the dose of IVIG within each course (eg, when 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> is given over two to four days) and the rate of infusion. Many of the known adverse reactions are most likely to occur during the first infusion, or the first infusion of a new product after changing brands. This was illustrated in a review of 15,548 infusions administered to 1705 patients, in which only 10 individuals had an adverse systemic reaction to a product they had previously received [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The underlying clinical condition may also affect the risk of adverse events. In a review of 13,508 IVIG infusions in 459 patients with primary antibody deficiencies, the presence of a concomitant infection increased the risk compared to that in patients without an infection (5.1 versus 0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Additional general risk factors include the initial infusion, hyperviscosity states (either from dehydration or a hyperviscosity syndrome such as cryoglobulinemia), underlying organ dysfunction (eg, renal insufficiency), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prothrombotic stimuli (eg, systemic inflammatory state or central venous catheter). However, adverse events also can occur in individuals who lack predisposing factors. More than half of reactions occur in the immediate period during or within a few hours of the infusion. (See <a href=\"#H657974\" class=\"local\">'Immediate reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Reactions have also been classified according to the age of the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; The incidence of adverse effects was evaluated in a prospective series of 345 IVIG infusions administered to 58 children (33 for immunodeficiency, 25 for immunomodulation; median age four years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Adverse events occurred in 26 children (40 percent). Immediate adverse reactions were seen in 3.5 percent of the infusions, and delayed reactions in 20.9 percent. Headache was the most common (24 percent of patients, 13 percent of infusions), and it most often occurred as a delayed reaction. Other common reactions included fatigue, abdominal pain, and myalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults</strong> &ndash; Additional risk factors in adults include coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, sepsis, immobility, and concomitant use of estrogens or nephrotoxic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2,4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,11,12</a>].</p><p/><p>Changing from a well-tolerated product to another product should be avoided when possible, and changes should not be made without the consent of the patient's clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients initiating IVIG therapy, or those switching between products, should be observed closely by a clinician who is familiar with the signs and symptoms of IVIG reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Potentially severe reactions include anaphylaxis in some IgA-deficient individuals, thromboembolic events including myocardial and cerebral ischemia, renal impairment, or severe hemolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Organ system</strong> &ndash; Organ systems that may be affected include the kidney, lungs, skin, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and hematopoietic system, particularly hemolytic reactions. Systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis and <span class=\"nowrap\">vascular/thromboembolic</span> complications can affect any organ system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing</strong> &ndash; Immediate reactions (eg, those that occur during or within six hours following the infusion) include IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and rate-related reactions such as headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/chills</span> (especially in patients with active infections), and occasionally thromboembolic events. Delayed reactions (eg, those that occur hours to days following the infusion) include <span class=\"nowrap\">headache/aseptic</span> meningitis, acute kidney injury, hemolysis, and thromboembolic events such as venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, and stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanism</strong> &ndash; Potential mechanisms of adverse reactions to IVIG include immune reactions such as complement activation. These may be caused by immune components in the product (eg, immune complexes, coagulation factors) or a reaction to them. Other mechanisms include those related to a specific antibody specificity (eg, hemolytic anemia from antibodies to a red blood cell antigen such as A, B, or Rh(D)), those related to active non-IgG proteins in the product (eg, Factor XIa), and those related to excipients such as sucrose or the osmotic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free water load of the infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H585079\"><span class=\"h2\">Changing products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient is having adverse effects that seem to be recurring in an infusion-related pattern and are interfering with IVIG therapy, a different product should be tried in the hope of finding one that is better tolerated. However, adverse effects may be more frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more severe whenever a new product is used. For this reason, extra caution and slow infusion rates should be used when changing the specific product used by any individual patient.</p><p>Patients who are receiving IVIG for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement (eg, immunodeficiency) generally require lower doses and thus may also be able to switch to a subcutaneous product (SCIG); SCIG generally is associated with a lower frequency of adverse events.

This is a rare event that occurs in a minority of IgA-deficient individuals. Those who have had a previous anaphylactic reaction suspected to be due to this condition may be tested for anti-IgA, switched to a low IgA product, or switched to subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (SCIG), as discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Anaphylaxis in IgA-deficient patients'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who experience mild headaches can take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (adults only), other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> prior to, or at the time of, IVIG infusion. In some cases, glucocorticoids may be useful or necessary.

An annual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> is recommended for most patients.

Potential immediate reactions include rate-related reactions in individuals with a concurrent infection or a non-IgE-mediated allergic reaction due to an immune mediator in the product or elicited by the product.</p><p>Local reactions at the administration site (eg, pain, bleeding bruising) are rare with IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate-related reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic rate-related reactions are relatively common, especially in patients receiving their first infusion of IVIG or changing to a different IVIG product. These reactions rarely are serious, but they can be distressing to the patient. In general, these reactions involve the following constellations of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H659714\"><span class=\"h3\">Concurrent infections/phlogistic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phlogistic reactions are generalized inflammatory symptoms that may accompany the use of IVIG, especially in patients with an acute infection. This may be more likely in patients with an underlying immunodeficiency that puts them at risk of bacterial infections. Often, the reaction occurs in the setting of a chronic sinus or lung infection.</p><p>Symptoms may resemble those that accompany the onset of infection in individuals with intact immune function. Examples include chills (and even rigors), fever, flushing, flu-like myalgias, arthralgias, malaise, nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> headache. Symptoms may be especially pronounced if the infection has not been treated with antibiotics and the patient is receiving IVIG for the first time. These symptoms are thought to result from interactions of the newly delivered antibodies with bacterial antigens, neoantigens in the patient, or pathologic autoantibodies in the patient. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other products released from newly opsonized organisms may also stimulate toll-like receptors and activate leukocytes and macrophages leading to rapid release of cytokines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eicosanoids.</p><p>When possible, patients with immunodeficiency should have a thorough search for any occult infections and should receive appropriate antibiotics before receiving IVIG for the first time, or if several months have passed since a patient's last infusion. In such cases, the delay need only occur for a day or two, providing there is reasonable evidence that the infection is responding and under control (eg, absence of severe fever or other acute symptoms). However, the initiation of IVIG should not be delayed further in patients who have an infection that has not responded to routine antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune globulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Initial doses and schedules'</a>.)</p><p>The inflammatory symptoms may be minimized by giving the IVIG slowly. Premedicating with antipyretics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoids as described above may also help, although high quality evidence to support this practice is lacking. (See <a href=\"#H658008\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p>If symptoms still occur, management generally involves temporarily interrupting the infusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treating specific symptoms. Rarely, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> may be needed for muscle spasm or severe musculoskeletal pain. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management of symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Reactions resembling anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions resembling anaphylaxis are usually rate-related and often occur midway through an IVIG infusion. Patients may develop urticaria, flushing; tachycardia; chest tightness, wheezing, or dyspnea; pain in the chest or lower back; nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a sense of impending doom or sudden anxiety. Tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachypnea may also be present. Individual symptoms may occur alone or in combination. Unlike IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, these reactions are often accompanied by increases, rather than decreases, in the blood pressure. Also unlike true anaphylaxis, which may become more severe upon re-exposure to the antigen, these reactions tend to become milder with subsequent infusions.</p><p>The mechanism of the non-IgE-mediated reactions is unknown.

However, many patients with low IgA levels tolerate products that are not specifically designated as low IgA. When present, anti-IgA antibodies may be of the IgE or the IgG class; they are usually IgG. It is possible that serious reactions may occur in patients who produce antibodies to particular IgG allotypes, although such antibodies are rarely of the IgE type and do not usually pose a risk of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. They are most likely to develop in individuals with complete IgA deficiency (serum IgA undetectable, level &lt;5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> who are exposed to IgA in IVIG or blood products that is thus seen as a foreign protein, but in whom other antibody production is possible. Examples include individuals with partial B cell immunodeficiencies and those with familial IgA deficiency.</p><p>In contrast, anaphylaxis is not usually a concern in patients with X-linked (Bruton's) agammaglobulinemia, because those patients cannot make IgE or IgG anti-IgA antibodies; or in patients with partial IgA deficiency (low but detectable levels of circulating IgA), although these patients may have serious reactions to blood or plasma products, which have higher concentrations of IgA. A literature review concluded that the evidence linking anti-IgA antibodies to anaphylactic reactions to IVIG remains controversial and that additional studies are necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In a case-control study that compared 19 individuals who experienced a thromboembolic event with 38 age-matched controls (median age, 71 years), a trend towards increased thromboembolic risk was seen if two or more cardiovascular risk factors (eg, smoking, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were present (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% CI 0.45-4.30); this increased risk became statistically significant when four or more of these risk factors were present (OR 10.5; 95% CI 1.91-57.58) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other data suggest that hereditary hypercoagulable states, hyperviscosity, indwelling catheters, autoimmunity, older age, estrogen use, previous thrombotic events, and immobilization may also increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hyperviscosity may occur in the setting of dehydration; hyperviscosity syndromes such as cryoglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathies; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; and components of the IVIG product itself (eg, sugars, osmotically active stabilizers, immunoglobulins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/11,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22-25</a>]. In a series of 2724 first-time IVIG infusions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or multiple myeloma, the incidence of arterial embolic events was increased during the first day (from a baseline of 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with no identified risk factors can also develop thromboembolic complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of interest, in 2010, a single IVIG product that was subsequently withdrawn from the market was associated with a marked increase in thromboembolic events. Analysis of this product identified elevated amounts of coagulation factor XI in the activated form (FXIa), a change that may have occurred during the manufacturing procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Additional steps to remove FXIa and assays for thrombin generating activity and nonactivated partial thromboplastin time have been added to the production process to assure safety of products. A form of the IVIG product that was withdrawn has been restored to the market using these additional processes, with no resumption of the elevated rate of thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sites</strong> &ndash; Sites of thrombosis may be arterial (in approximately 80 percent) or venous, and include acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, transient cerebral ischemia attack, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/28-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-34</a>]. Local thrombosis at the site of IVIG infusion can also occur, with extension from the extremity to larger veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Timing</strong> &ndash; Timing of the events is variable. In one series from a neurology center in which 62 patients were treated with a total of 616 courses of IVIG over two years, thromboembolic events occurred in seven patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In five patients, the event occurred within two weeks of treatment. This rate is somewhat higher than the overall background rate of approximately 0.8 events per 1000 kg of IVIG distributed, or 1 event per 10,000 courses of 100 grams each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other reports suggest arterial events are more likely to occur within hours to days of an infusion, whereas venous events are more likely to occur after days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention</strong> &ndash; The risk of thromboembolism can be minimized by ensuring adequate hydration and avoiding prolonged immobilization (eg, airplane travel) in the days following the infusion. Additional strategies in patients at high risk of thromboembolic complications include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid administration of large doses in a single day; doses can be divided such that no more than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is administered per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administer IVIG at relatively slow rates, such as below 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/hour</span> and avoid &ldquo;as-tolerated&rdquo; dose escalations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use products with a lower osmolarity for patients at risk of hyperviscosity. As an example, 5 percent solutions of IVIG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>) can be reconstituted with water rather than saline to give a final concentration of 3 to 6 percent rather than 10 to 12 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assess blood viscosity in patients with hyperviscosity syndromes. Patients are most likely to become symptomatic at viscosities in excess of 5 to 8 centipoise.

These headaches typically begin after the infusion is complete. Nuchal rigidity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other signs of meningismus may also be present, suggesting that there is a continuum of symptoms, extending to include aseptic meningitis with pleocytosis. In rare cases, these headaches may be accompanied by high fevers. The evaluation for possible meningitis is presented separately.

Patients may also be premedicated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a> (an antihistamine and serotonin receptor antagonist) (2 to 4 mg for children or 4 to 12 mg for adults), or another type of antimigraine preparation, which can then be repeated at the first sign of symptoms. Severe post-infusion headaches may be prevented or ameliorated by treatment with prophylactic glucocorticoids (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or equivalent in divided doses in children or 30 to 60 mg prednisone or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> in adults), alone or in combination with an NSAID or other antimigraine preparation. Antimigraine medications may be tried first in patients with histories of migraine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whose post-infusion headaches are accompanied by migraine-like symptoms. Glucocorticoids may be tried first in patients whose post-infusion headaches are accompanied by fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of meningismus since these may be triggered by immunologic reactions within the central nervous system. In some cases, one or more of these medications may be required for as long as 72 hours after the infusion is completed. However, glucocorticoids do not appear to be useful in treating aseptic meningitis induced by IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Five of these patients subsequently underwent lumbar puncture within 48 hours, which showed neutrophilic pleocytosis in four and increased cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) IgG concentrations in all affected patients. These headaches were not prevented by changing the brand of IVIG, fractionating the dose, or administering glucocorticoids. This study suggests that some of the severe headaches may be due to meningeal irritation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation caused by antibody-antigen reactions or by the IgG itself.</p><p>In many patients, headaches diminish after the first few infusions, although some develop a recurrent pattern of symptoms occurring at seemingly reproducible intervals after each infusion.

Additional mechanisms that may apply in some patients include renal heme pigment injury related to red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis, increased blood viscosity, and immune complex deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Strategies to minimize the risk of AKI include ensuring adequate hydration prior to starting the infusion, and using an infusion rate for sucrose-containing products that maintains the infusion of sucrose at &le;3 mg of sucrose per kg per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with pre-existing renal disease or increased risk of renal complications and those whose renal function deteriorates during or after use of a sucrose-containing product should not receive IVIG solutions that are more concentrated than 5 percent and should not receive sucrose-containing products (eg, Carimune NF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>). It is also appropriate to avoid administration of large doses in a single day; doses can be divided such that no more than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is administered per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H584499\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia is a rare complication of IVIG that can occur in individuals with underlying renal insufficiency or those who develop acute kidney injury from the IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The mechanism is dilutional and thought to involve the inability of the kidney to handle the free water load in the setting of an underlying defect in free water excretion. Free water comes from the IVIG solution as well as from translocation of water from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment as a result of high concentrations of maltose or sucrose in the IVIG solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].</p><p>It is important to distinguish true hyponatremia, which is associated with decreased serum osmolality, from pseudohyponatremia, which is a laboratory artifact (see <a href=\"#H584914\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> below), because patients with pseudohyponatremia should not have free water restriction, which in turn could increase the risk of other complications of IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Distinction between true hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia using measurement of serum osmolality is presented separately.

The mechanism presumably involves antibodies present in the IVIG product, referred to as isoagglutinins, that react with RBC antigens of the Rh and ABO blood group systems (eg, anti-Rh(D), anti-A, anti-B). In mild cases, there may be a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, although this is not always seen, as antibody-sensitized RBCs may be cleared rapidly. Repeated episodes of mild hemolysis (eg, with IVIG every three or four weeks) may result in reticulocytosis. Sequestration of sensitized RBCs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild intravascular hemolysis may result in transient anemia with reticulocytosis. Intravascular hemolysis can cause decreased serum haptoglobin and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and acute severe intravascular hemolysis can cause hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, and renal <span class=\"nowrap\">damage/dysfunction</span>.</p><p>Risk factors for hemolysis include high-dose infusions (eg, 1 to 2 grams per kg), high IVIG doses (eg, &gt;100 grams), female sex, and non-O blood group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/51,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,64,65</a>]. This was illustrated in a series of 1000 patients receiving IVIG in which 16 cases of hemolysis were identified (1.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Factors present in more than half the patients with hemolysis included a large dose of IVIG, non-O blood group, increased inflammatory markers such as increased ESR, and female sex. The onset of hemolysis ranged from 12 hours to 10 days, and the mean decrease in hemoglobin was 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p>Some manufacturers have been developing additional steps in the manufacturing process that decrease the presence of isoagglutinins. When applied to the Privigen product (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>), this resulted in an approximately 90 percent reduction in isoagglutinins, without apparent effect on product quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. The modified product is not yet available.</p><p>We order a direct antiglobulin test for patients receiving high-dose infusions who are female and non-O blood group as well as individuals who have had a prior episode of hemolysis associated with IVIG or prior evidence of an ABO antibody. A positive antiglobulin test that is not due to a recent transfusion or to the disease being treated must be evaluated (eg, antibody specificity, presence of hemolysis) and addressed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>). If IVIG is being used to treat a condition responsible for hemolysis, then the infusion should proceed with caution.</p><p>For patients with clinically severe hemolysis and a positive anti-ABO antibody, the total IVIG dose can be reduced or fractionated into four to five doses, which may be given on consecutive days with careful monitoring before each additional aliquot, although this may not prevent the complication in all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Switching brands of IVIG may also be helpful (eg, when divided doses are not effective and the hemolysis is severe), and cross-matching with new lots has also been advocated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. When appropriate, subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) may also be substituted as almost all cases of hemolysis are associated with the intravenous route of administration, with only one case report of hemolysis associated with subcutaneous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. IVIG preparations with reduced isoagglutinin content are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

The mechanism may be due to neutrophil margination to the vascular wall upon activation by complement or immune globulins in the IVIG product. Another mechanism involves immune clearance induced by antineutrophil antibodies or antibodies to &quot;sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 9&quot; (Siglec-9) in the IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. In some cases, the neutropenia may be a feature of an underlying immunodeficiency rather than a complication of the IVIG.</p><p>The neutropenia is most likely to be transient, and in most cases intervention is not required. However, if a patient develops neutropenia in the setting of TRALI, measures such as premedication with glucocorticoids, slowing the infusion rate, and fractionation of the IVIG dose into smaller doses to be given over several days should be used for subsequent IVIG infusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H660184\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse events that may occur weeks to months after receiving IVIG include dermatologic reactions, impaired vaccination response, and the theoretical (but highly unlikely) risk of an infectious agent transmitted from the IVIG product.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6924704\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermatologic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A literature review identified 64 cases of eczematous dermatitis associated with IVIG therapy, mostly in patients receiving high doses for neurologic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A vesicular eruption of the palms or soles (dyshidrotic eczema), appearing within eight days of administration, was a characteristic presentation. Most patients were successfully treated with topical corticosteroids, with resolution within three weeks. However, the reaction tended to recur with subsequent IVIG treatments, requiring ongoing therapy. A few cases of alopecia, erythema multiforme, and baboon syndrome have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In addition, no product produced with current safety measures has ever been reported to have transmitted a bloodborne disease, and no transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or other human prion-mediated disorder has been reported in any patient receiving IVIG. No cases of HIV infection have been reported. However, our understanding of prions is far from complete, and one cannot be certain that available measures will remove or inactivate all potential (and as yet undescribed) clinically significant pathogens.</p><p>Parvovirus B19 is not destroyed by solvent detergent or heat treatment; however, it is thought that antibodies to parvovirus present in most IVIG preparations are sufficient to prevent clinical infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Despite the safety of available IVIG products, historical cases of infectious transmission have been reported.

Additional cases were reported in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. That episode served as a wake-up call, both to the manufacturers and to clinicians. Steps were added to the plasma procurement and IVIG processing procedures to reduce risks of transmission of bloodborne pathogens.</p><p>Further measures taken by the manufacturer include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All plasma is derived from US donors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma donors must complete a detailed questionnaire about risk factors and possible exposures.

This phenomenon is due to the protein load, which increases the nonaqueous phase of plasma. Because the concentration of sodium is physiologically regulated in the aqueous phase, but the laboratory sodium determination uses the total plasma volume of the sample, an artifactual dilution of sodium results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pseudohyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, patients with underlying renal disease may develop true hyponatremia, as discussed above.

Maltose may also give false readings with some glucose meters used by diabetics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests for various antibodies (especially antiviral titers, but possibly also antinuclear antibodies [ANA], antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies [ANCA], rheumatoid factor) may become falsely positive due to the passively transmitted antibodies in the IVIG. Thus, these serologic tests cannot be relied upon after an infusion since it is difficult (unless the patient has agammaglobulinemia) to determine if the patient or the donor pool is the source of the antibodies.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Renal complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemolytic anemia can occur from antibodies in the IVIG product that react with red blood cell (RBC) antigens of the Rh and ABO blood group systems. Reactions can range from direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT)-positivity, mild extravascular hemolysis, and rarely, intravascular hemolysis. Risk factors include high dose, female sex, and non-O blood group. Neutropenia can occur, but it is generally mild and transient. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eczematous dermatitis or reduced efficacy of vaccinations may occur days to weeks following the infusion. IVIG products are extremely unlikely to transmit infectious agents (eg, viruses, prions); however, a theoretical risk exists and information about brand, lot number, expiration date, and manufacturer should be retained for each dose administered. (See <a href=\"#H660184\" class=\"local\">'Late reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of IVIG can also cause some laboratory abnormalities that are helpful to be aware of but generally are not considered patient-important.
