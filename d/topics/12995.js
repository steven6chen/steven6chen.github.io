Technically, a Q wave indicates that the net direction of early ventricular depolarization (QRS) electrical forces projects toward the negative pole of the lead axis in question. Although prominent Q waves are a characteristic finding in myocardial infarction, they can also be seen in a number of noninfarct settings. Failure to appreciate the other causes of Q waves can lead to important diagnostic errors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-electrocardiographic-interpretation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of electrocardiographic interpretation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The presence of a Q wave does not indicate any specific electrophysiological mechanism. To the contrary, Q waves can be related to one or more of the following four factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58569 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-q-waves-on-the-electrocardiogram/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic and positional effects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial injury or replacement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular enlargement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered ventricular conduction</p><p/><p>Clinicians should be aware of three principles with respect to Q waves: not all Q waves are pathologic; not all pathologic Q waves are due to myocardial infarction caused by fixed coronary artery occlusion; and there is no firm consensus on the criteria for the diagnosis of pathologic Q waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-q-waves-on-the-electrocardiogram/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Accordingly, Q waves should always be interpreted in the clinical context.</p><p>A broader discussion of the electrocardiogram in MI is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC AND POSITIONAL EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic activation of the ventricles begins at the left side of the interventricular septum. These early septal depolarization forces are oriented anteriorly and to the right. As a result, small (&lt;0.04 sec in duration) &quot;septal&quot; Q waves typically occur in the lateral precordial leads (which have a left-right orientation) and in one or more of the limb leads (except aVR). Depending upon the electrical axis, more prominent Q waves (as part of QS or QR-type complexes) can also appear in the limb leads: in aVL with a vertical axis; and in leads III and aVF with a horizontal axis. A QS complex in which the QRS is entirely negative can also occur in lead V1 as a normal variant and rarely in leads V1 and V2.</p><p>Prominent Q waves may be associated with a variety of other positional factors that alter the orientation of the heart in relation to the lead axis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Misplacement of chest lead electrodes is an important cause of anterior pseudo-infarction patterns. Slow R wave progression in the precordial leads, sometimes with actual QS waves, may be due solely to improper placement of chest electrodes above their usual position or on, rather than under, the left breast in women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In dextrocardia, normal R wave progression may be restored by recording right-sided precordial leads, assuming that there are no underlying structural abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rightward mediastinal shift in left pneumothorax may contribute to the apparent loss of left precordial R waves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other positional factors associated with slow (formerly referred to as &quot;poor&quot;) R wave progression include pectus excavatum, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and, rarely, congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels or congenital absence of the left pericardium.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOCARDIAL DAMAGE AND REPLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reason why Q waves do or do not develop following coronary occlusion is related to the duration of occlusion, the extent to which collateral vessels maintain myocardial viability during occlusion, and ultimately, to the size of the infarction. Loss of electromotive forces due to myocardial necrosis in MI leads to R wave loss. Delayed conduction through an ischemic area or conduction around it results in recording potentials from the opposite ventricular wall with Q wave formation in the appropriate leads. Furthermore, relatively tall and slightly broad R waves (usually 30 msec or wider) in V1 and V2 may be Q wave &ldquo;equivalents&rdquo; in patients with inferior-posterior or lateral wall infarctions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;, section on 'Location of ischemia or infarction'</a>.)</p><p>A common clinical misconception is the presumption that patients with heart failure and prominent Q waves necessarily have &quot;ischemic&quot; cardiomyopathy. Any process, acute or chronic, that causes sufficient loss of regional electromotive potentials can result in Q waves. Examples include dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, replacement of myocardial tissue by electrically fibrous tissue or other electrically inert material such as amyloid fibrils or by metastatic tumor, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (which simulates a posterolateral infarct). Transient Q waves can also occur with myocardial ischemia (without infarction) and with certain metabolic disturbances such as hyperkalemia. Transient or persistent Q waves may also occur with stress-induced (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-stress-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERED CONDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intrinsic change in the sequence of ventricular depolarization can lead to pathologic, noninfarct Q waves. The two most important conduction disturbances associated with pseudo-infarct Q waves are left bundle branch block (LBBB) and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation patterns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Left bundle branch block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With LBBB, the initial septal depolarization forces are oriented from right-to-left, opposite from the normal direction. As a result, QS complexes may appear in the right and mid-precordial leads and occasionally in one or more of leads II, III, and aVF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-approach-to-delayed-intraventricular-conduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic approach to delayed intraventricular conduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With WPW, an accessory (atrioventricular) conduction pathway bypasses the AV node and initiates ventricular depolarization in an anomalous fashion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-asynchronous-activation-and-preexcitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of asynchronous activation and preexcitation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Depending upon the location of this bypass tract, initial negative QRS forces (and therefore Q waves) may be seen in the right precordial (V1 to V3), left precordial (V4 to V6), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limb leads. WPW can also produce a tall wide R wave in lead V1, simulating a &quot;posterior&quot; infarction.</p><p>The diagnosis of WPW is made by the triad of a relatively short PR interval (usually but not always less than 120 msec), a wide QRS complex, and a delta wave (slurred or notched segment on the upstroke or downstroke of the QRS complex in one or more leads).</p><p>It should also be appreciated that, in addition to producing pseudo-infarct patterns, both LBBB and WPW can <strong>mask</strong> the findings of a true infarction. As a result, the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG in diagnosing infarction are reduced by these conduction disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Left anterior fascicular (hemi-) block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable confusion surrounds the effect of left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) on the ECG and, in particular, on the question of whether this common conduction disturbance can actually cause an anterior pseudo-infarct pattern (eg, QS complexes V1 to V3). The ECG diagnosis of LAFB is supported by the presence of marked left axis deviation (usually more negative than -45&ordm;) with slight or no widening of the QRS complex. However, LAFB has only minor effects on the QRS complex in the horizontal plane (chest) leads. Probably the most common finding is a relatively prominent S wave in leads V5 and V6.</p><p>Slow R wave progression per se is not a routine feature of LAFB, although some authors have reported minuscule q waves in leads V1 to V3 in this setting. These micro-q waves (less than 0.1 mV in depth or less than one mm with standard calibration) may become more apparent if the leads are recorded one interspace above their usual position and may disappear in leads one interspace below their usual position. As a general rule, however, prominent Q waves (as part of QS or QRS complexes) in the right to-mid precordial leads should not be attributed to LAFB alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic Q waves are often incorrectly considered a specific marker of ventricular injury and loss of myocardial depolarization forces. However, an important cause of pseudo-infarct patterns is left or right ventricular enlargement. Slow R wave progression is commonly observed with left ventricular hypertrophy and with acute or chronic right ventricular overload. Q waves in these settings may reflect a variety of mechanisms, including a change in the balance of early ventricular depolarization forces and altered cardiac geometry and position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A marked loss of R wave voltage sometimes with frank Q waves from V1 to the lateral chest leads can be seen with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The presence of low limb voltage and P pulmonale (increased height of the P wave in lead II) point toward the diagnosis of COPD rather than a myocardial infarction, although the two diagnoses can coexist.</p><p>This diminution or frank loss of R wave progression in COPD may in part reflect right ventricular dilation. In addition, downward displacement of the heart in the emphysematous chest may play a major role in the genesis of slow R wave progression in some cases. Partial or complete normalization of R wave progression in this setting can often be achieved simply by recording the chest leads an interspace lower than usual. In contrast, Q waves due to infarction are not altered by this change in lead position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pulmonary embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of pseudoinfarct patterns can occur with acute cor pulmonale due to pulmonary embolism or other factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute right ventricular overload can cause slow R wave progression and sometimes right to mid precordial T wave inversions (right ventricular &quot;strain&quot;), changes that mimic an anterior infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic S1Q3T3 pattern of McGinn and White can occur, but is neither sensitive nor specific for pulmonary embolism. A prominent Q wave (usually as part of a QR complex) in lead aVF may also be seen with this pattern. However, acute right ventricular overload by itself does not cause a pathologic Q wave in lead II.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right heart overload, acute or chronic, may be associated with a QR complex in lead V1 and sometimes V2, simulating anterior infarction. The precise mechanism of this pattern has not been determined. This finding may occur with chronic pulmonary thromboembolic hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pulmonary embolism more rarely may cause actual ST-elevation in right chest leads, probably related to right ventricular ischemia in the context of chamber dilation and hypoxemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudoinfarct patterns are an important finding in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including those with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. The ECG in this disorder can simulate anterior, inferior, posterior, or lateral myocardial infarction.</p><p>The pathogenesis of the depolarization abnormalities in this cardiomyopathy is not well understood. Prominent inferolateral Q waves (in leads II, III, aVF, and V4 to V6) and tall right precordial R waves are probably related to increased depolarization forces generated by the markedly hypertrophied septum. Abnormal septal depolarization may also contribute to the bizarre QRS complexes.</p><p>The polarity of the T waves may be useful in the differential diagnosis of Q waves due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy versus infarction. When prominent Q waves (in leads showing a small terminal r wave or none at all) are due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the T wave will be upright. With infarction, prominent Q waves may be associated with upright or inverted T waves. Thus, a prominent Q wave (as part of a QS or Qr-type complex) with T wave inversion argues against hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, upright T waves in this setting have no diagnostic value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Depressed left ventricular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pseudoinfarction pattern can be seen in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic) in the absence of coronary disease and myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-q-waves-on-the-electrocardiogram/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This finding may be due in part to the presence of left ventricular conduction delays, left ventricular enlargement, or to left ventricular scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">AIDS TO DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of unexpected Q waves on the ECG poses an important clinical problem. The Q waves may be the residua of a previously unsuspected &quot;silent&quot; myocardial infarction; they may also represent a normal or positional variant, or an important noncoronary type of heart disease. The decision about how far to proceed in investigating unexpected Q waves must be individualized. The history and physical examination may provide important information. In addition, the ECG may need to be repeated to exclude lead misplacement in selected cases.</p><p>The most useful noninvasive test in the assessment of unexplained Q waves is the echocardiogram. Echocardiography may, for example, confirm the likelihood of underlying myocardial infarction by showing regional wall motion abnormalities. Furthermore, a number of conditions associated with noninfarct Q waves may be diagnosed or suggested by echocardiography: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular overload syndromes including pulmonary embolism, dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac tumors, and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac resonance imaging may also be useful in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-q-waves-on-the-electrocardiogram/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
