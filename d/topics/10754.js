The 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> adult congenital heart disease guidelines recommended that all adults with congenital heart disease of moderate or greater complexity (including those with cyanotic heart disease) should undergo initial evaluation and longitudinal coordination of care by such a specialized center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Cyanosis is caused by right to left intracardiac or extracardiac shunts. In adults, the most common causes of cyanotic congenital heart disease are Eisenmenger syndrome and palliated complex congenital heart disease (eg, palliated single ventricle, complex pulmonary atresia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-prognosis-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Medical management of adult patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease is discussed here. Management of Eisenmenger syndrome patients includes following recommendations pertinent to all patients to cyanotic heart disease as well as other recommendations specific to Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension in congenital heart disease. These later recommendations are discussed separately.

Oral and other bacterial infections should be treated promptly. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis is recommended for all patients with unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocytosis and relative anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cyanosis develop secondary erythrocytosis. This is a physiologic response, since the cyanotic blood stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells in an attempt to improve tissue oxygenation. Stable erythrocytosis and a new equilibrium are usually established at an appropriate level.</p><p>In some patients, however, hematopoiesis increases dramatically and the hemoglobin rises to over 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with an hematocrit of more than 65 percent. Symptoms of hyperviscosity may develop, such as headache, loss of concentration, muscle weakness, and fatigue. Volume depletion can cause identical symptoms and must be excluded.</p><p>Symptomatic hyperviscosity is treated with phlebotomy in an effort to lower red blood cell mass; this should be carried out slowly with simultaneous infusion of isovolumic fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62212\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62212 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Frequent phlebotomies and iron deficiency should be avoided, since rebound erythropoiesis can occur, with production of iron deficient red blood cells (microspherocytes). Microspherocytes have reduced oxygen-carrying capacity as well as increased rigidity and fragility. As a result, there is an <strong>increase</strong> in whole blood viscosity (with the associated symptoms noted above) as well as possible symptoms of iron deficiency with relative anemia (weakness, headache, irritability, and varying degrees of fatigue and exercise intolerance).</p><p>The risk of cerebrovascular events in patients with rebound erythropoiesis and microspherocytosis remains unclear.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 162 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease were retrospectively evaluated for any well-documented cerebrovascular events that occurred at &ge;18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Events related to procedures, endocarditis, or brain abscess were excluded. Twenty-two patients (13.6 percent) had 29 cerebrovascular events (a rate of approximately 1 percent per year). Patients who had a cerebrovascular event had a significantly increased tendency to develop hypertension, atrial fibrillation, microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume &lt;82), and a history of phlebotomy. Even when patients with hypertension or atrial fibrillation were excluded, there was an increased risk of cerebrovascular events associated with microcytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, 112 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease followed for almost seven years were divided into two groups: those with &quot;compensated&quot; erythrocytosis (stable hematocrit of 46 to 73 percent, iron replete, and absent or mild hyperviscosity symptoms), and those with &quot;decompensated&quot; erythrocytosis (unstable rising hematocrit of 62 to 75 percent, iron deficiency, and marked to severe hyperviscosity symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No patient in either group suffered a stroke.</p><p/><p>Although these reports differed with respect to the implications of microspherocytosis, they both concluded that phlebotomy in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and secondary erythrocytosis should be used in a conservative manner.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Guidelines and recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rather than solely using a target hematocrit, phlebotomy should be performed only in patients with intrusive symptoms of hyperviscosity, and then only with caution in the setting of iron deficiency. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guideline recommending therapeutic phlebotomy for hemoglobin greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and hematocrit &gt;65 percent, associated with headache, increasing fatigue, or other symptoms of hyperviscosity in the absence of dehydration or anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some experts also recommend preoperative phlebotomy to improve hemostasis. In our practice, this is only performed in select patients (hemoglobin greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and hematocrit &gt;65 percent) at high risk for bleeding around the time of an elective operation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated routine phlebotomies are <strong>not </strong>recommended because of the risk of iron depletion, decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>When phlebotomy is indicated, it is performed by withdrawing 250 to 500 mL of blood with replacement with volume of intravenous saline; air filters are routinely recommended for intravenous infusion in patients with intracardiac shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Symptomatic relative anemia can occur in cyanotic patients and is most often due to iron deficiency resulting from rebound erythrocytosis or bleeding. The 2008 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> guidelines recommend avoidance of iron deficiency in patients with cyanotic heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The treatment of iron deficiency is iron therapy which should be administered with care since iron supplementation may lead to rapid increases in red cell mass. Although there are no specific data regarding timing, we recommend that oral iron supplementation be instituted when the mean corpuscular volume is less than 82, since microspherocytes may increase the cerebrovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Iron should be discontinued when the hematocrit begins to rise, usually within 7 to 10 days. The benefit of iron therapy for the cyanotic patient with iron deficiency and no microcytosis has not been established; we consider iron therapy for patients with functional decline, in the hope this may improve symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyanotic patients have an increased risk of hemorrhage due to a number of hemostatic abnormalities documented in up to 20 percent of patients; these include elevations in the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, reduced coagulation factors, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal platelet function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The extent to which these abnormalities contribute to clinical bleeding risk is uncertain. However, pulmonary bleeding and menorrhagia are common. Thus, while patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have an increased risk of thrombotic complications, we recommend that anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs be <strong>avoided</strong> unless clear indications arise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoptysis is external bleeding and does not reflect the extent of intrapulmonary hemorrhage, which is a serious and life-threatening problem for Eisenmenger and other cyanotic patients and can reflect rupture of the pulmonary trunk or a bronchial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Bronchoscopy is associated with significant risk and rarely discloses the cause of hemoptysis; as a result, this procedure is generally avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pulmonary computed tomographic angiography should be performed to determine the presence and extent of intrapulmonary hemorrhage.

Suppression of menorrhagia with hormonal stimulation is often helpful; however, endometrial ablation, placement of an intrauterine device, or hysterectomy is occasionally required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted, we do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend routine anticoagulation for patients with cyanotic heart disease. Exceptions to this rule include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documented pulmonary thrombosis or embolism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient ischemic attack or stroke without evidence of microcytosis or other identifiable and treatable cause</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep venous thrombosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placement of an indwelling device (such as a permanent pacemaker) in the right side of the heart. Intracardiac devices are generally avoided in patients with congenital heart disease-related pulmonary hypertension with persistent intracardiac shunting and other patients with cyanotic heart disease. In the presence of such devices, anticoagulation may not protect against thromboembolic complications.

Hyperuricemia can lead to gout but rarely to renal failure, since the hyperuricemia is primarily due to reduced excretion rather than increased production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-cyanotic-congenital-heart-disease-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Intravenous or oral hydration should be considered to minimize renal injury.
