Knock-knees (genu valgum) are an angular deformity at the knee where the apex of the deformity points toward the midline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62835\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62835 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Bow-legs and knock-knees are among the most common musculoskeletal anatomic variations encountered by pediatric primary care providers and a common reason for referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. However, most children with bow-legs or knock-knees have variations of normal lower-extremity development that can be monitored by the primary care provider.</p><p>An understanding of the normal physiologic development of the lower extremity is essential in differentiating physiologic from pathologic alignment. Pathologic causes of bow-legs include Blount disease, nutritional rickets and other metabolic bone diseases, skeletal dysplasia, infection, trauma, and neoplasia. Unlike physiologic bowing, these conditions generally do not improve over time and may require treatment with bracing or surgery.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of normal physiologic alignment of the lower extremity, physiologic and pathologic causes of bowing, and an approach to the child with bow-legs. Knock-knees are discussed separately.

This may cause severe varus deformity, leg length discrepancy, and articular incongruity.</p><p>There are two types of Blount disease: infantile and adolescent. Infantile Blount disease typically is diagnosed before four years of age and must be distinguished from physiologic varus; it is usually bilateral (80 percent of cases) and typically worsens after walking has begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bow-legs/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].

The femur MD angle is less than the tibial MD angle (ratio of femur MD angle:tibial MD angle &lt;1).</p><p>The treatment of Blount disease depends upon the age of the child and the severity of the deformity. Patients with infantile Blount disease may be treated with braces to unload medial compressive forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bow-legs/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. Brace treatment should be started by three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bow-legs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

If the deformity does not resolve with bracing, surgical therapies include guided growth through hemiepiphysiodesis (arrest of the growth plate on the apical side of the deformity) or tibial osteotomy and realignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-bow-legs/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

The absence of these findings on radiographs does not preclude a less severe degree of metabolic bone disease. Rickets deformity may improve with medical treatment (ie, vitamin D repletion).

A lateral thrust is a brief lateral knee-joint protrusion during the stance phase of gait.
