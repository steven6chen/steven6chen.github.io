A variety of serum markers are used to screen for Down syndrome in the first <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> second trimesters. This topic will review laboratory issues related to use of these markers. Clinical issues related to Down syndrome are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Overview of prenatal screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester combined test and integrated tests for screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Quadruple marker test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The quad test is performed in the early second trimester (optimally at 15 to 18 weeks of gestation) and consists of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), and inhibin A (inhA) measurements.

Those whose screen does not place them at very high risk go on to complete the second trimester portion of the integrated test.

If Down syndrome screening is performed at 14 weeks, a second sample is required at a later date for neural tube defect screening with AFP. </p><p>Many programs suggest testing occur between 16 and 18 weeks, which optimizes testing for both Down syndrome and neural tube defects, and allows ample time for follow-up testing in screen-positive pregnancies.</p><p>First trimester combined tests can be interpreted when the serum is drawn between 10 and 13.9 weeks using PAPP-A, nuchal translucency, and free beta-hCG, but is limited to 11 to 13.9 weeks when using PAPP-A, nuchal translucency, and total beta-hCG measurements. In some programs, the serum may be drawn several weeks prior to the ultrasound examination, while in other &quot;one-stop&quot; clinics, the serum and ultrasound results are available within an hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17534334\"><span class=\"h2\">hCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the free beta subunit of hCG can be performed using either beta-hCG measurements or the free beta subunit with little or no impact on test performance. United States laboratories tend to use beta-hCG because commercial kits to measure the free beta subunit of hCG are not available. </p><p>Free beta is spontaneously generated by the disassociation of intact hCG. Programs that measure free beta hCG need to be aware of this potential problem, especially in locations where samples may be exposed to high temperatures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantifying analyte levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the serum analytes used in prenatal screening is measured using immunoassay technology; most often by automated methods. The levels of first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers can be measured reliably when the blood sample is centrifuged within an hour and the serum is kept refrigerated and received by the testing laboratory within a week of being drawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Analyte values are initially measured as standardized mass units. For the five maternal serum analytes used in Down syndrome screening, the units most commonly used in the United States are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AFP &mdash; either <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>uE3 &mdash; <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>beta-hCG &mdash; <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>inhA &mdash; <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PAPP-A &mdash; <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span></p><p/><p>Each mass value is converted to the screened woman's gestation-specific multiple of the median (MoM), since the serum levels of each analyte are constantly changing during the periods of gestation in which screening is done [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The process of normalization requires that each screening laboratory develop sufficient data to generate reliable gestation-specific medians. Medians should be generated by testing fresh serum samples from women with singleton pregnancies between 15 and 22 gestational weeks inclusive for second trimester markers and between 10 or 11 and 13 weeks for first trimester markers.</p><p>Regressed data should show that, in the early second trimester, AFP increases by 15 to 20 percent per week and estriol by 20 to 25 percent per week. Levels of beta-hCG decrease exponentially from a peak at 15 weeks, diminishing more slowly until becoming nearly constant at &ge;20 weeks. Inhibin A exhibits a shallow U-shaped curve with its nadir at 17 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76646%7EOBGYN%2F68253%7EOBGYN%2F66827%7EOBGYN%2F54546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76646 graphicRef68253 graphicRef66827 graphicRef54546 \">figure 1A-D</a>). First trimester PAPP-A levels increase by 30 to 50 percent per week between 10 and 13 weeks of gestation. Free and total beta-hCG levels reach a peak at about 10 weeks of gestation and decline through the remainder of the first trimester. Free beta-hCG levels decline more quickly than total beta-hCG (by about 10 to 30 percent and 5 to 10 percent per week, respectively).</p><p>Patient data are usually expressed as MoM values after population-based medians are established, thereby eliminating the effects of assay differences and gestational age. As an example, an AFP mass value of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span> measured at 15 weeks of gestation might calculate to a normalized value of 1.0 MoM. Similarly, an AFP mass value of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span> measured at 20 weeks might also calculate to a normalized value of 1.0 MoM. Thus, the AFP levels measured at these two different gestational weeks are comparable once they have been normalized for gestational age. In addition, an AFP value of 30 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> may be the median value at 16 weeks at one laboratory, but the median may be 32 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> at another. However, the average woman at each laboratory will still have an MoM value of 1.0.</p><p>Multiples of the median also provide a relatively simple way to compare an individual to the entire population being screened. By definition, the central value in unaffected singleton pregnancy is 1.0 MoM; thus, 2.0 MoM indicates that the woman is at twice the central value, while 0.5 MoM indicates that the woman is at one-half the central value. Since the distribution is Gaussian only after a logarithmic transformation, equal numbers of women would be expected to have values below 0.5 MoM and above 2.0 MoM.</p><p>Prior to clinical implementation of any analyte as a screening marker, the distribution of its levels in unaffected and affected pregnancies must be thoroughly described. Most laboratories cannot assess analyte levels in affected (Down syndrome) pregnancies because of limited access to sufficient numbers of such samples. As a result, they must use data reported in the scientific literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>] or from commercial providers of software used in prenatal screening. In contrast, each screening laboratory can and should examine the distribution of MoM data in its total population, almost all of it derived from unaffected pregnancies (known twins could be removed). The parameters of the population distribution (the center of the distribution or mean of log MoM values, and the breadth of the distribution or standard deviation of the log MoM values after appropriate trimming of outliers) should be consistent with published parameters of such distributions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGES IN ANALYTE LEVELS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Down syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distributions of MoM values of AFP, uE3, beta-hCG, and inhA in the second trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52502\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52502 \">figure 2</a>), and PAPP-A, free beta-hCG, and total beta-hCG in the first trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61531 \">figure 3</a>) in unaffected and Down syndrome pregnancies are Gaussian (normal) on a logarithmic scale.</p><p>Compared to unaffected pregnancies, levels of second trimester AFP and uE3 are, on average, 0.70-0.75 MoM in Down syndrome, and the levels of first trimester PAPP-A are, on average, 0.4 MoM. Therefore, for these markers, the distribution of affected population values is shifted to the left of the unaffected population. Second trimester levels of beta-hCG and inhibin A are about 2.0 MoM, the first trimester level of free beta-hCG is about 1.8 MoM, and the first trimester level of total beta-hCG is 1.4 MoM, thus shifting the distribution of affected population values for these markers to the right of the unaffected population. In examining overlapping distributions, the extent of the overlap is a function of both the distance between the medians and the widths (log standard deviations) of the two distributions. The more separate and &ldquo;tighter&rdquo; the distributions, the better the marker's performance.</p><p>The median MoM values of the second trimester markers in Down syndrome pregnancy are relatively constant when measured between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the median MoM values of the first trimester markers in Down syndrome pregnancies change systematically when measured between 10 and 13 weeks of gestation. This change in marker performance should be accounted for in the calculation of patient-specific risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Median PAPP-A rises from about 0.4 MoM at 10 weeks to about 0.7 MoM at 13 weeks, so the performance of PAPP-A decreases as gestation progresses. Median free and total beta-hCG also rise during this period, and results in increasing performance of these markers since they are both elevated in Down syndrome pregnancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79124 \">figure 4</a>). These two effects tend to cancel with performance being relatively constant over the indicated time period.</p><p>The reasons for altered maternal serum analytes in Down syndrome pregnancy are poorly understood. Placental secretory products, such as the clinically important markers beta-hCG and inhibin A (as well as other products such as progesterone&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], human placental lactogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]), are generally increased in the second trimester of Down syndrome pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/6,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-12</a>]. However, PAPP-A is also a placental secretory product, and its levels are low in the first trimester and not different from unaffected fetuses in the second trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. None of the genes for these placental products resides on chromosome 21, thereby eliminating a simple dosage effect to explain the increased or decreased concentrations. Placental size and weight are comparable in Down syndrome and unaffected pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. There may be an increase in the synthesis of specific placental proteins in Down syndrome, as suggested by beta-hCG and inhibin mRNA and protein studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Deficient syncytiotrophoblast formation may also have a role in abnormal placental secretion in affected pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>By comparison, secretory products synthesized in the fetus or requiring the combined fetoplacental unit are, on average, low in second trimester maternal serum from Down syndrome pregnancies. As an example, levels of AFP derived from the fetal liver are reduced, as are maternal serum and amniotic fluid concentrations of the fetoplacental steroid, uE3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and its fetal androgen precursor molecules, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and 16-alpha-hydroxyDHEA-S [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms leading to this phenomenon of increased placental and decreased fetal products in second trimester maternal serum of Down syndrome pregnancy are actively being investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/15-18,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18,22-24</a>].

It is estimated that about 90 percent of trisomy 18 pregnancies can be identified by first trimester screening with a false positive rate &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27,28</a>]. However, these estimates are less confident than those for Down syndrome due to potential biases in many of the published studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester combined test and integrated tests for screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the second trimester, the analyte pattern suggestive of trisomy 18 is low levels of AFP, uE3, and beta-hCG. The reduction in analyte levels is, on average, 40 percent for AFP, 60 percent for uE3, and 70 percent for beta-hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The concentration of inhibin A is only slightly reduced (by 12 to 16 percent), thus it is not used in screening for trisomy 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

If a pregnancy affected by triploidy continues to the second trimester, screening results for cases of Type I triploidy (diandric) will often indicate a high risk of Down syndrome because of low uE3 and elevated beta-hCG and inhibin A concentrations in maternal serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. AFP levels in triploidy are not predictable; they may be high, low, or unremarkable.</p><p>Type II triploidy (digynic) originates from an extra set of maternal chromosomes and is characterized by a small fetus, small placenta, and intrauterine survival late into pregnancy. In the study mentioned above, first trimester median levels were extremely low, 0.16 MoM for free beta-hCG and 0.06 MoM for PAPP-A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In these digynic triploidy cases, the risk algorithms for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 in combination resulted in detection of 84 percent of cases at a 3.1 percent false positive rate. Maternal serum levels of uE3 are extremely low (usually less than 20 percent of normal values) in Type II triploidy (digynic) and beta-hCG and inhA are also reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Although the gene alterations responsible for SLOS are relatively common and suggest a high prevalence, the birth prevalence of SLOS is quite low (1 in 20,000 to 40,000 or even lower). This is likely due to a high fetal loss rate in early pregnancy. The second trimester marker pattern associated with SLOS is a very low uE3 level (median 0.21 MoM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] because the steroid precursors required for estriol synthesis are deficient in the fetus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71463\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71463 \">figure 5</a>), and somewhat low levels of AFP (median 0.72 MoM) and beta-hCG (median 0.76 MoM).</p><p>Maternal serum screening for SLOS with AFP, uE3 and beta-hCG is expected to be very efficient, with a detection rate of about 60 percent at a 0.3 percent false positive rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A trial that attempted to identify Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in conjunction with prenatal screening for Down syndrome included over 1 million pregnant women and reported an 83 percent detection rate at a 0.3 percent false positive rate, although the prevalence of SLOS (1 in 100,000 Caucasians) was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

For this reason, some laboratories continue to offer this interpretation. </p><p>Prenatal diagnosis of SLOS can be performed by amniocentesis with amniotic fluid measurement of cholesterol and its precursors, 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A woman's a priori risk is determined based on her chronological age at the estimated date of delivery and history of previous Down syndrome pregnancy. This risk is then increased (or decreased) by a factor called the &ldquo;likelihood ratio&rdquo; (LR). The LR is determined by comparing each of her serum marker MoM values with the reference distributions, after accounting for the degree of independence between each pair of markers (measured as an R value after log transformation of the MoMs). The final reported risk is her calculated patient-specific risk of having a fetus affected by Down syndrome in that pregnancy. The chosen cut-off for a screen positive result and recommendation for further diagnostic testing has been, by convention, the risk of Down syndrome pregnancy in a 35- or 37-year-old woman. However, as tests improve in sensitivity and specificity, higher risk cut-offs (eg, 1:100 rather than 1:250) are beginning to be used. This allows for higher performance tests, like the integrated test, to obtain lowered false positive rates while still providing high detection.</p><p>The goal of screening is to maximize the detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. The number of affected and unaffected individuals who are called screen positive (ie, those identified by the test as high risk) is also dependent upon the prevalence of the disorder in the population being screened. If, as an example, testing the oldest 5 percent of pregnant women in the general population identifies 30 percent of all Down syndrome pregnancies, the screen positive group will have a six-fold higher risk <span class=\"nowrap\">(30/5)</span>. In the general population, the prevalence of Down syndrome pregnancy at birth is about 1 in 700, therefore the screen positives will have a group risk of 1 in 117 (ie, 1 in <span class=\"nowrap\">700/6)</span>. This result, expressed as a percentage (0.9 percent), is the positive predictive value.</p><p>A better screening test, such as one that identifies 90 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies with only 2 percent false positive rate (eg, integrated screen), will yield a group with a 45-fold higher risk <span class=\"nowrap\">(90/2)</span>. Thus, screen positives will, on average, have a group risk of 1 in 16 (ie, 1 in <span class=\"nowrap\">700/45)</span>. Of course, an individual woman would be interested in her specific risk, not the group risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">VARIABLES THAT AFFECT PERFORMANCE AND INTERPRETATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of risk cut-off</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each patient should be given the specific numerical risk of Down syndrome (eg, 1 in 100) calculated for her based on her age, family history, and screening test results. The risk cut-off chosen for test interpretation (ie, identifying patients as screen negative or screen positive) determines the detection and false positive rates for Down syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56294 \">table 3</a>). For a given test, as the risk cut-off becomes higher, fewer women are screen positive and fewer affected pregnancies will be identified; the positive predictive value (PPV) will be relatively high. If less stringent risk cut-offs are chosen, a greater number of affected pregnancies will be identified, but there will be more false positive tests and the PPV will be lower. This would lead to a larger number of couples experiencing parental anxiety and having to consider costly and potentially risky diagnostic procedures. Thus, there is always a trade-off between a higher detection and a tolerable false positive rate.</p><p>By convention, the risk of Down syndrome pregnancy for a 35 year-old woman has been used as the cut-off to identify pregnancies at increased risk (ie, screen positive women). The appropriateness of this convention is in question because of the marked improvement in performance of new screening tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The 2007 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines recommend offering screening to women of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], and a 2006 study suggests that amniocentesis may be safer than previously thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Second trimester versus term risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of Down syndrome is stated as either the risk of giving birth to an affected baby (so-called term risk), the risk of carrying an affected fetus in the second trimester (midpregnancy risk), or the risk of carrying an affected fetus in the first trimester. Term risk is significantly lower than second trimester risk at all maternal ages due to loss of affected fetuses in the late second and the third trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75423 \">table 4</a>). Put another way, intrauterine demise occurs in more than one-third of Down syndrome fetuses between 12 weeks and term and in 20 to 25 percent between 16 weeks and term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Thus, a second trimester risk of Down syndrome of 1 in 190 is equivalent to a term risk of 1 in 250. First-trimester risks are even higher than second-trimester risks.</p><p>About three-quarters of United States screening programs report second-trimester risk. Programs that rely on first-trimester combined screening often report first-trimester risk. There is no advantage of reporting one type of risk over another, although it is essential to know which is being used, clearly report the trimester of risk in patient reports, and use one of these conventions consistently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of maternal age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each woman's initial risk at screening is based upon her age-related risk for having a child with Down syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75423 \">table 4</a>). Since older women start at higher risk, they are more often screen positive than their younger counterparts. This also leads to a higher Down syndrome detection rate in older women. However, the risk of Down syndrome birth does not increase further after the age of 45 years, likely because of higher miscarriage rates in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior pregnancy history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Geneticists generally tell patients the recurrence risk of aneuploidy is at least 1 percent if a woman has had a prior Down syndrome pregnancy (non-inherited type). This figure is based upon data published in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Subsequent analyses of North American data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] and of previously published studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>] have suggested that the overall incremental risk of recurrence is less than 1 percent and that the excess risk is higher for younger than for older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57</a>]. For example, data from the United Kingdom National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register clearly show that the recurrence risk for younger women (under 27 years old) is about 4 or 5 per 1000 births, and that risk drops to 2 or 3 per 1000 in women in their early 30s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. By ages 36 to 42, the excess risk is only 1 per 1000 births, and by age 44, there is no excess risk of recurrence.</p><p>The risk of recurrence of inherited (ie, translocation) Down syndrome is usually much higher, but depends upon the specific translocation.

Ultrasound dating results in a narrower distribution of serum marker values in both affected and unaffected pregnancies, leading to improved performance. In one study, at a fixed 5 percent false positive rate, the Down syndrome detection rate using the quadruple test increased by 9 percentage points when ultrasound rather than LMP dating was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Adjustment of AFP for African-Americans is commonly done because it is the sole marker used in screening for neural tube defects. Differences in analyte levels for other races have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>], but adjustments may be difficult to implement because of limitations in patient self-reporting of <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> or insufficient data regarding the effect size. Laboratories that provide services to many women of other races may be able to determine their median data for these women.

Since the individual contribution of each twin to the maternal serum marker levels cannot be determined, prenatal screening in twin pregnancies is not as efficient as in singleton pregnancies (when both twins are affected, performance may be similar, but in discordant twins, screening performance is reduced). With correction of MoM values in twin gestation, a screening result can be generated that assumes each fetus contributes equally to the marker levels. However, a precise risk estimate cannot be given because of this assumption and because the actual marker levels in twin pregnancies affected with Down syndrome are not known with certainty. Serum screening is not generally considered interpretable in higher order pregnancies (eg, triplets, quadruplets). In such cases, ultrasound evaluation may be a useful screening alternative.

There appears to be little impact of smoking on the prevalence of Down syndrome, once the maternal age of the women is accounted for [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in serum marker levels have also been noted in association with factors such as parity, fetal gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/30,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,96</a>], and maternal systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. In these cases, the effect is small, the data collected are insufficient to warrant adjustment, or the correction cannot be implemented easily.</p><p>Other factors, such as renal <span class=\"nowrap\">insufficiency/hemodialysis,</span> adrenocorticotropic hormone insufficiency, and the use of various medications (eg, antiretroviral therapy), have also been associated with effects on maternal analyte levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-issues-related-to-maternal-serum-screening-for-down-syndrome/abstract/98-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-106</a>].

The detection rate is higher and the false positive rate lower than for other Down syndrome screening tests. It can be performed any time after 10 weeks of pregnancy. However, cell-free DNA fails to give a test result for some women, the testing is more expensive, and results take about a week to complete.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal screening results are evaluated using risk-based assessment. A woman's a priori risk is determined based upon her chronological age and history of previous Down syndrome pregnancy. This risk is then modified by comparing her serum marker values against published expectations. The final risk estimate is her calculated patient-specific risk of having a fetus affected by Down syndrome in that pregnancy.
