Obstruction can occur at valvar (by far the most common), subvalvar, and supravalvar levels.</p><p>Supravalvar aortic stenosis will be reviewed here. Valvar and subvalvar aortic stenosis are discussed separately.

Among children with congenital AS, supravalvar AS has accounted for 8 to 14 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are at least two anatomic forms of supravalvar AS. The majority of patients (60 to 75 percent) have an hourglass deformity, consisting of a discrete constriction of a thickened ascending aorta at the superior aspect of the sinuses of Valsalva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88409\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88409 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. More diffuse narrowing for a variable distance along the ascending aorta is seen in 25 to 40 percent. There are also rare reports of a discrete membranous stenosis, which may be a variant of the hourglass deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The major histologic features of the ascending aorta in supravalvar AS are a thickened and dysplastic media with an increased number of hypertrophied smooth muscle cells, increased collagen content, and a paucity of elastic tissue with disorganized elastin fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Further support for an abnormality in elastin is the high frequency of supravalvar AS in patients with Williams syndrome, which is due to a mutation in the elastin gene (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below). Supravalvar AS in these patients has been characterized as one manifestation of an elastin arteriopathy.</p><p>Supravalvar AS is associated with several other cardiovascular anomalies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aortic valve leaflets may be thickened, redundant, and have reduced mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one report, the aortic valve leaflets were partially adherent to the stenosing supravalvar ridge in more than one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery stenosis can occur due to focal or diffuse coronary narrowing, or due to obstruction by redundant, dysplastic aortic valve leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coarctation of the aorta and ostial stenoses of the carotid, renal, iliac, and other peripheral arteries are seen in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery stenoses, either of the main pulmonary artery or of branch pulmonary arteries, are common, occurring in approximately one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In contrast to the systemic arterial stenoses described above, pulmonary artery stenoses typically decrease in severity over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p>The mitral valve is usually normal.</p><p>In our experience at the Children's Hospital Boston (1988 to 2002), supravalvar aortic stenosis (134 patients) was associated with aortic regurgitation in 41 percent; with subvalvar aortic stenosis in 10 percent, and only one patient had a bicommissural aortic valve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiology of supravalvar AS is similar to that of valvar and subvalvar stenosis. Significant obstruction is associated with a hyperdynamic, hypertrophied left ventricle. Elevated systolic pressure in the aortic root may be responsible for the associated coronary artery enlargement and dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva that are often seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As noted above, coronary artery stenosis can occur, and subendocardial ischemic changes may be seen even without coronary narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Supravalvar AS creates a systolic jet that tends to hug the aortic wall and transfer kinetic energy into the right innominate artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This phenomenon, known as the Coanda effect, is the mechanism that explains higher blood pressure in the right than left arm in most patients with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supravalvar AS occurs in four settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a feature of Williams syndrome, which is also characterized by unusual facial features, intellectual disability (mental retardation), and hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,19</a>]. In a report from a multicenter consortium for children with Williams syndrome and cardiovascular lesions who underwent cardiac catheterization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> operation, supravalvar AS was diagnosed in 169 of 242 patients, followed by pulmonary stenosis in 130 patients and coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia in 32 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Supravalvar AS also is seen less frequently in heterozygotes (4 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This disorder typically affects adults and rarely is seen in children. It is not clear whether the lesion is solely a manifestation of aortic atherosclerosis or whether an underlying structural abnormality is present.</p><p/><p>In a 1983 series of 25 patients with supravalvar AS age 1 to 49 years, the distribution of Williams syndrome, the familial form, and the sporadic form was 28, 20, and 52 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is not apparent whether the authors looked for FH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic studies have also demonstrated that the non-FH forms of supravalvar AS are caused either by mutations in or, in Williams syndrome, deletion of the elastin gene located on chromosome 7q11.23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/18,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25-29</a>].

As an example, loss of one allele of the LIM-kinase gene is thought to be responsible for the defects in visuospatial cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Some deaths have been attributed to undiagnosed coronary artery ostial obstruction. Cardiac repolarization abnormalities with prolongation of the QT interval by electrocardiogram (ECG) may play a role as well; prolonged QTc occurs in approximately 14 percent of Williams syndrome patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, supravalvar AS is usually the only abnormality in patients with familial or sporadic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,20</a>], although peripheral pulmonary stenosis has been described in at least one family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In contrast to patients with Williams syndrome, prolonged QTc does <strong>not</strong> appear to occur in those with nonsyndromic supravalvar aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>Clinical manifestations related to the supravalvar disease include those due to the LVOT obstruction and possible coronary ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/9,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,16</a>]. The following reports illustrate the range of cardiac symptoms that have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 44 patients with Williams syndrome and a structural heart defect, 35 (80 percent) had symptoms at birth, including 34 with failure to thrive, four with heart failure, two with cyanosis, and one with absent femoral pulses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two reports including 174 patients (5 days to 27 years of age) undergoing surgical correction of supravalvar AS <strong>not</strong> due to Williams syndrome, the NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional class prior to surgery was I in 11 percent, II in 57 percent, III in 26 percent, and IV in 6 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supravalvar AS often is detected by the findings on cardiac auscultation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51024 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Affected patients typically have a loud systolic ejection murmur best heard at the first right intercostal space; there is no associated ejection click or diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation, findings that are common in valvar AS. In the series of 44 patients described above, 28 had a murmur detected during the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The aortic component of the second heart sound may be accentuated due to elevated pressure in the aorta proximal to the stenosis. A thrill at the first right intercostal space is common.</p><p>Other common findings are suprasternal notch thrills, unequal carotid pulsations due to ostial stenosis, and a higher blood pressure in the right compared with the left arm due to the high pressure jet in the ascending aorta (the Coanda effect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>]. A blood pressure difference between the two arms of more than 10 mmHg has been noted in approximately two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of supravalvar AS is confirmed by echocardiography. Echocardiography also can assess left ventricle function and hypertrophy and estimate the gradient across the obstruction. In practice, an accurate Doppler measurement of the aortic gradient frequently is sufficient to determine which patients are candidates for surgical correction of isolated lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with angiography also provides excellent anatomic detail of supravalvar aortic obstruction, together with associated aortic branch vessel disease, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. MRI is used when acoustic windows are poor, or when physical examination or other findings suggest associated lesions of the vascular tree (eg, branch vessel involvement).</p><p>The chest radiograph typically is normal, although some patients have mild to moderate cardiomegaly. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy in many older patients, which may be accompanied by a strain pattern. In addition, the ECG may show right ventricular hypertrophy in patients with significant pulmonary artery obstruction due to peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cardiac catheterization provides precise hemodynamic and angiographic evaluation, but is not routinely necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88409\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88409 \">image 1</a>). It may be performed when additional lesions are suspected, such as coronary, carotid, renal, or pulmonary artery stenoses. Pulmonary artery stenoses often are amenable to balloon dilation. When bilateral outflow obstruction is present and significant, catheterization may be extremely hazardous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive therapy for supravalvar aortic stenosis (AS), whether discrete or diffuse, consists of surgical correction of the obstruction. Stent placement has been reported in a few patients, with mixed results.</p><p>Surgery in supravalvar AS usually is performed at gradient levels that are lower than in valvar AS to avoid the progressive obstruction that occurs in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/5,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,41</a>]. The likelihood of progression varies with the initial gradient. This was illustrated in a study of 45 patients with supravalvar AS diagnosed in infancy and followed for 13 years: 32 patients with a pressure gradient less than 20 mmHg had no evidence of progression during the first two decades of life, while 13 patients with a gradient exceeding 20 mmHg had progression of the mean gradient from 35 to 53 mmHg, with eight requiring surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The risk of progression of supravalvar aortic stenosis in adult patients is considerably lower than in childhood; one multicenter study of 113 adults with supravalvar aortic stenosis (55 percent of whom had Williams syndrome) followed for a median of six years showed that progression of supravalvar aortic stenosis was rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this cohort, cardiac operation was performed in 13 percent of patients, but the majority of those were valve repair or replacements.</p><p>The indications for surgery are uncertain because experience is limited. Since surgery is usually curative for the discrete form (in contrast to valvar AS), we recommend operation for symptomatic disease and for patients with a measured gradient at catheterization of more than 30 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Flap plasty techniques usually are successful in alleviating the discrete type of stenosis, which, as noted above, accounts for 60 to 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/38,41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41,44</a>]. Techniques include simple single patch enlargement into the sinotubular junction just above the aortic root, bifurcated patches extended into two sinuses, and separate three sinus patch enlargement methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In one report of 75 patients, the mortality rate was less, need for reoperation was reduced, and hemodynamics were improved by multiple sinus reconstructions compared with single sinus patch enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Relief of diffuse obstruction is more complex; surgical options include extensive endarterectomy with patch aortoplasty or resection of the stenotic segment with end-to-end anastomosis to the distal ascending aorta, with or without insertion of a pulmonary autograft (the Ross procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/10,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,38</a>].

A few studies with long-term follow-up have been reported. The results generally have been similar, with variability due to different patient populations, indications for surgery, and perhaps surgical technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supravalvar-aortic-stenosis/abstract/38,41,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41,45-47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The operative mortality ranged from 1 to 9 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients discharged from the hospital, survival ranged from 94 to 98 percent at 10 years and 77 to 97 percent at 20 years.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of supravalvar AS is confirmed by echocardiography. Echocardiography also can assess LV function and hypertrophy, and estimate the pressure gradient across the obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive treatment of supravalvar AS is surgical correction. Indications for surgery are uncertain because of limited outcome data. At our center, we suggest surgical correction for patients with a gradient greater than 30 mmHg measured by cardiac catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgical repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocarditis prophylaxis is not necessary for most patients with supravalvar AS, except those with a previous history of endocarditis, or with a repair with prosthetic material or device. In these latter patients, prophylactic antibiotics are given only for the first six months after repair unless a residual defect is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcome varies following surgical repair and is dependent on the nature of the stenosis and presence of associated lesions.
