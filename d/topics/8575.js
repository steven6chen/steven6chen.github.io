While many patients expire without recovering awareness, improved techniques in resuscitation and artificial life support have resulted in greater numbers of patients surviving with variable degrees of brain injury. The evolution of hypothermic treatment for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest has furthered the potential to improve neurologic morbidity and lessen mortality following anoxic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>While progress has also been made in the early identification of patients at greatest risk of poor neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest, reliable prediction of good outcomes, with intact memory and independence, has lagged. The evaluation and prognosis of patients with non-traumatic hypoxic-ischemic brain injury are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coma is defined as a state of pathologic unconsciousness; patients are unaware of their environment and are unarousable. It is caused by either dysfunction of the reticular activating system above the level of the mid-pons, or dysfunction of both cerebral hemispheres. Physical examination permits localization of the level of central nervous system dysfunction (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Coma must be distinguished from the persistent vegetative state, which is also characterized by unawareness, but in which patients have normal sleep-wake cycles and are arousable. Patients in a coma may progress to a vegetative state, but this may not be associated with an improvement in their overall functional outcome. Both coma and persistent vegetative states must be distinguished from brain death, locked-in syndrome (a condition in which the patient is awake and aware but cannot move or communicate due to muscle paralysis), akinetic mutism (a condition resulting from frontal lobe injury in which the patient does not initiate speech or movements), and dementia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54393\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54393 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;, section on 'Conditions mistaken for coma'</a>.)</p><p>The vegetative and minimally conscious states are clinically defined syndromes. Importantly, prognosis for recovery can vary depending on the underlying etiology and differs between patients who have hypoxic ischemic versus traumatic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain death (death by brain criteria) is defined as the irreversible cessation of cerebral and brainstem function. There is no respiratory drive, and thus there are no spontaneous breaths regardless of hypercarbia or hypoxemia. There are no responses arising from the brain (including cranial nerve reflexes and motor responses) to stimuli, although spinal reflexes may persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One is legally dead in the United States when criteria for brain death have been demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases patients who meet brain death criteria may be potential organ donors; issues specific to the management of these individuals are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-potential-deceased-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the potential deceased donor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent vegetative state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) represent a subgroup of patients who suffer severe anoxic brain injury and progress to a state of wakefulness without awareness. A vegetative state may represent a transition between coma and recovery or between coma and death. The term was first used in 1972 and is defined as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/4,6,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of awareness of self or environment and an inability to interact with others</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of sustained, reproducible, purposeful, or voluntary behavioral responses to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of language comprehension or expression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent wakefulness manifested by the presence of sleep-wake cycles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sufficiently preserved hypothalamic and brainstem autonomic function to permit survival with medical and nursing care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel and bladder incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variably preserved cranial nerve reflexes and spinal reflexes</p><p/><p>If a patient remains comatose, the usual outcome is to recovery, PVS, or death within two weeks. On the basis of available clinical data, PVS is judged to be permanent after three months if induced nontraumatically. For traumatic brain injury, a year in this state is generally required to be considered permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most data indicate that after three months in a PVS related to HIE, recovery is rare and is associated with moderate to severe disability at best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. With the use of ancillary testing it is often possible to arrive at reliable prognostic conclusions in much shorter intervals of time following cardiac arrest (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary testing'</a> below).</p><p>The distinction between PVS and the minimally conscious state can be difficult. Careful and repeated bedside testing has been reported to reveal evidence of awareness and voluntary responses in patients originally believed to be in a PVS. </p><p>Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies have revealed that a small proportion of patients with traumatic brain injury who satisfied the above criteria for vegetative state show evidence of awareness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In these studies, patients were verbally instructed to either imagine a motor activity (playing tennis) or an imagined visual exercise (alternatively looking at rooms in their homes). Patients who responded showed increased blood oxygen level determination (BOLD) signal in the motor or visual centers in the cerebral hemispheres to the appropriate question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These binary responses were also used to generate <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> answers to questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Similarly, another study found electrophysiologic responses to an auditory cognitive paradigm in two patients with PVS after traumatic brain injury and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Another small case series found that 3 of 16 patients with PVS were able to repeatedly and reliably generate appropriate EEG responses to two distinct commands, despite being behaviorally unresponsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While these signs of awareness are more often observed in patients with PVS after TBI, they have been described in nontrauma cases as well, including at least one case of HIE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. These studies have raised concern about the possibility of awareness in patients who are diagnosed with PVS, and it may be more appropriate to communicate predictions regarding outcome in terms of levels of disability, which can be reliably determined using clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In patients who continue in PVS, life expectancy is approximately two to five years, and most patients die from infection of the lungs or urinary tract, multiorgan system failure, sudden death of unknown cause, respiratory failure, or underlying disease. It is estimated that there are 10,000 to 25,000 adult patients in PVS in the United States, generating an estimated annual cost of care of up to seven billion dollars.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimally conscious state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term minimally conscious state (MCS) has been proposed to describe patients who do not meet criteria for persistent vegetative state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As with PVS, these patients have a severe alteration in consciousness. In contrast to PVS, they may intermittently demonstrate limited interaction with the environment by visually tracking, following simple commands, signaling yes or no (not necessarily accurately), or having intelligible verbalization or restricted purposeful behavior. In one series, patients in a MCS demonstrated sleep-wake cycles with both slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while patients in PVS did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R) appears to be a useful tool to aid clinicians in soliciting responses to stimuli that distinguish patients in PVS with those in MCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25,26</a>].

However, data on late recovery of patients in MCS are largely reported in traumatic, rather than anoxic, brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. One case series of 39 minimally conscious patients included seven with a primary etiology of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Five years after coma-onset, only one of these seven patients had emerged from this state compared with one-third of the patient group overall. In this case series, the best recovery from the minimally conscious state was characterized as severe disability.</p><p>Because MCS may represent a group of patients with a better prognosis after brain injury, clinical investigations have been undertaken to ascertain specific clinical and diagnostic test features that might reliably distinguish between patients with MCS and PVS, and also that might identify patients in both groups that have either a better or worse prognosis for late recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. While these require further study, those that show promise include advanced neuroimaging techniques (including functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and electrophysiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,34</a>], as well as clinical scales such as the Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC (INDUCED) HYPOTHERMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The induction of mild to moderate hypothermia (chill therapy) to a target temperature 32 to 34&ordm;C in the initial hours after cardiac arrest improves the neurologic outcome of resuscitated patients.

However, none of these factors is sufficiently reliable to differentiate those with poor outcomes (no greater than PVS) from those patients who regain awareness.</p><p>The circumstances of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can affect prognosis after a cardiac arrest in terms of both survival and quality of life. In one study of out of hospital cardiac arrest, 44 percent of patients receiving CPR survived initially, 30 percent were alive at 24 hours, 13 percent at one month, and only 6 percent were alive after six months. The duration of CPR significantly correlated with outcome; no patient who required more than 15 minutes of CPR survived more than six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Bilateral absence of the N20 component of the SSEP with median nerve stimulation at the wrist in the first week (usually between 24 and 72 hours) from the arrest has a pooled likelihood ratio of 12.0 (95% CI of 5.3 to 26.6) and a false positive rate of zero percent for an outcome no better than PVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/34,36,47,52,60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,47,52,60-65</a>].

Although some studies have suggested that the presence or absence of the long latency response, N70, on SSEP can add to the prognostic ability of SSEP in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], a multicenter cohort study did not confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Induced hypothermia may slow conduction velocities and alter the predictive ability of SSEP findings in patients with anoxic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>].

Furthermore, the EEG is susceptible to subjective interpretation, the effects of sedative drugs, metabolic disturbances, and sepsis, which can invalidate the results.</p><p>EEG categories can be crudely classified into malignant and <span class=\"nowrap\">benign/types</span>.

Of these findings, complete, generalized suppression (&lt;20 microvolts) is the most specific for poor outcome; other patterns are less reliable for prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/34,36,37,61,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37,61,72,73</a>]. In another series of 51 patients who had EEG monitoring during therapeutic hypothermia and subsequent rewarming, EEG findings remained stable in most (75 percent) and worsened in 8 percent; malignant EEG findings during normothermia were associated with poor outcome in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The presence of variability and reactivity are relatively favorable features for recovery of awareness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/37,54,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,54,74</a>].</p><p>An EEG can also be helpful to evaluate for the possibility of status epilepticus, which may be clinically suppressed by sedation or neuromuscular junction blockade, medications sometimes used to control shivering in induced-hypothermia therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

A meta-analysis of all reported biochemical tests in blood and CSF concluded that the combined results were not sufficiently predictive for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/47,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,83</a>].</p><p>Subsequent studies have confirmed that markedly elevated serum levels of NSE and S-100 are associated with poor outcomes, but cut-off values vary among series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis/abstract/52,83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,83-86</a>].
