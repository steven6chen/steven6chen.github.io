Together, blockade of these nerves can provide complete analgesia during breast surgery. The pectoral block has been shown to result in lower pain scores and lower perioperative opioid consumption in women with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy <strong>without</strong> reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmastectomy-pain-syndrome-risk-reduction-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

A systematic review of these core modalities demonstrated that a multimodal approach, involving stretching and active exercises, was useful for the treatment of breast cancer pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmastectomy-pain-syndrome-risk-reduction-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83786997\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary and alternative medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as guided imagery, acupuncture, and biofeedback, has also been used in managing chronic neuropathic pain.

Acupuncture is an effective treatment strategy to manage some of the symptoms associated with breast cancer surgery, including pain, numbness, limited range of motion, and lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postmastectomy-pain-syndrome-risk-reduction-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

The clinical evidence of the effectiveness of acupuncture to manage chronic pain conditions (low back pain, knee osteoarthritis) is reviewed separately.

We suggest infiltrating the operative site with a long-lasting local anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>) prior to making the incision to reduce early postoperative pain (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9432075\" class=\"local\">'Preemptive analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a known history of prolonged postoperative pain, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> 37.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 10 days beginning the night before surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

To minimize the risk of sensory deficits, we preserve the intercostal brachial nerve during the axillary dissection unless gross metastatic disease is present. (See <a href=\"#H83786955\" class=\"local\">'Preservation of axillary nerves'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute and chronic pain may be caused or exacerbated by psychosocial risk factors, such as anxiety, depression, and interpersonal conflicts.

For patients who experience pain relief following this procedure, we then perform an excision of the neuroma.
