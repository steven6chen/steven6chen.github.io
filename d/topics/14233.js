Anaphylactoid reactions were reported within 30 days in four persons who received antimicrobial PEP.

The 30-day antimicrobial treatment regimens completely protected animals while they were on therapy; posttreatment survival in animals given only antimicrobial therapy ranged from 70 to 90 percent compared with 100 percent survival in animals given antimicrobial therapy plus vaccine.</p><p>A third study in monkeys compared a 14-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> with the combination of a 14-day regimen of ciprofloxacin plus three doses of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthrax-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthrax vaccine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-anthrax/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Only 44 percent of animals receiving 14 days of antimicrobial therapy alone survived compared with 100 percent survival among animals given both antimicrobial therapy and the anthrax vaccine.

AVA was licensed originally for use as a six-dose, subcutaneously administered series. The use of AVA as part of the postexposure prophylaxis regimen involves a shortened vaccination schedule as described above. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Postexposure prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p>The schedule for preexposure immunization (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in 2008) calls for a series of five intramuscular injections administered at 0 and 4 weeks and at 6, 12, and 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-anthrax/abstract/16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27</a>].

In the trial, 1563 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of six groups: AVA subcutaneously on the licensed six-dose schedule; AVA intramuscularly on the licensed six-dose schedule; AVA intramuscularly on one of three reduced dose schedules; or saline placebo. A midpoint analysis of the first 1005 participants who received the first four doses of vaccine through month 7 showed that immunogenicity at month 7 was noninferior for groups receiving either three (0, 4 weeks, and 6 months) or four (0, 2, 4 weeks, and 6 months) intramuscular injections. When tested at week 4, individuals who received vaccine only at week 0 had lower antibody levels than those who received vaccine at weeks 0 and 2. Thus, using the former regimen in the postexposure situation would be questionable. There was a significantly lower incidence and severity of injection site adverse effects for the intramuscular route compared with the subcutaneous route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-anthrax/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There were 229 serious adverse events (SAEs) in the 1563-participant cohort, involving 186 participants.
