The amount of blood removed varies between one and three units (450 to 500 mL constitutes one unit), although larger volumes may be withdrawn safely in certain circumstances. The blood is infused into the patient during or shortly after the surgical procedure.</p><p>ANH can be used as the sole blood conservation technique, or it can be combined with preoperative autologous donation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-preoperative-autologous-blood-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation&quot;</a>), blood salvage (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a>), or both. </p><p>Whether ANH is effective in decreasing allogeneic blood transfusion is debatable, and outcome benefits have not been clearly demonstrated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Advantages and disadvantages'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) can be considered for patients with normal initial hemoglobin (Hgb) levels who are expected to lose more than two units of blood (900 to 1000 mL) during surgery. It is safest when used in healthy, young adults, but can be used in other populations. It is a good option for Jehovah's Witnesses who will consent to ANH if the blood is maintained in a closed circuit continuous flow system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to the patient who refuses blood transfusion&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In patients with a normal or high initial Hgb levels who are undergoing cardiac surgery, decreased blood viscosity associated with the induced anemia may have cardioprotective effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>ANH is generally avoided in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with impaired cardiac function (eg, ejection fraction &lt;45 percent) who may have limited ability to increase cardiac output, since the main compensatory mechanism for induced anemia is a physiologic increase in cardiac output.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired renal function with oliguria, since potentially large amounts of replacement fluids ultimately need to be excreted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline Hgb &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low concentrations of coagulant proteins or platelets, or abnormalities of coagulation or platelet function tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to monitor Hgb concentration, platelet number, and coagulation function with rapidly available results (ie, 5 to 30 minutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate vascular access.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Amount of blood to withdraw</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of blood that may be withdrawn during acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is derived from the following formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"> &#160;V &#160; = &#160; EBV &#160;x &#160;({Hgb-i &#160;- &#160;Hgb-f} &#160;&divide; &#160;Hgb-av)</p></div></div><p/><p>where V is the volume of blood to be removed (liters), EBV is the estimated blood volume (liters), Hgb-i is the initial hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL),</span> Hgb-f is the desired hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL),</span> and Hgb-av is the average hemoglobin (average of Hgb-i and Hgb-f). Blood volume in adults can be crudely estimated as 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in lean men and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> in lean women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, it is important to recognize the imprecision of this estimate, and to realize that mass-based blood volume decreases in a non-linear fashion with increasing age and with increasing body mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a 70 kg patient with an estimated blood volume of 4900 mL (rounded to 5 L), an initial hemoglobin of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> and a desired hemoglobin of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> the volume of blood to be drawn is: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;V &#160; = &#160; 5.0 &#160;x &#160;({15 - 10} &#160;&divide; &#160;12.5) &#160; = &#160; 2.0 liters (four units)</p></div></div><p>The actual amount of blood removed will depend upon the patient's initial blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], hemodynamic stability, and the anticipated blood needs. Although there is good evidence that healthy patients, appropriately monitored, can tolerate a Hgb as low as 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> clinicians do not aim for such a low level. Most anesthesiologists aim for a Hgb of at least 8 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> after ANH, in order to maintain a safety net in the event of acute surgical blood loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Non-cardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671122\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normovolemia is maintained during blood withdrawal by simultaneous administration of intravenous resuscitation fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ideal vascular access consists of two large-bore cannulae placed into a central <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large peripheral vein(s) to allow simultaneous blood withdrawal and volume replacement. An indwelling bladder catheter is also required since the urine output serves as a crude guide to intravascular volume status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35028986\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ANH is generally initiated after the induction of anesthesia and stopped before surgical bleeding becomes significant, according to the anesthesiologist's judgment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replacement of intravascular volume can be accomplished using either colloid or crystalloid solutions. The volume infused depends upon the solution used. Crystalloids are distributed through the extracellular (intravascular plus interstitial) volume. As a result, the volume of crystalloid infused usually exceeds the volume of blood withdrawn. In comparison, colloids are initially restricted to the vascular space. Thus, the volume initially administered should approximate the volume of blood withdrawn. Regardless of the solution used, the volume of fluid administered is typically adjusted depending on factors such as the hemodynamic response and the urine output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood withdrawal procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood is withdrawn into a special blood donor bag, which typically contains citrate for anticoagulation and additives to prolong the life of the stored blood. Hemodilution kits are available containing two blood bags, a Y-type connector set with a Luer lock adapter, and a blood recipient identification band. These kits are convenient and improve safety since no phlebotomy needle is used. </p><p>A scale is required to determine the amount of blood removed. The donor bag should be placed on a mechanical agitator (ie, a rocker), unless gentle agitation of the blood bag can be accomplished by hand. Agitation prevents platelet aggregation and may preserve platelet function.</p><p>This blood should be maintained at room temperature (approximately 22&deg;C [72&deg;F]) to preserve platelet function. A blood warmer will be needed in cold operating rooms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Handling the blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each unit of blood should be labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, time of blood withdrawal, and sequential number (if more than one unit is removed). According to the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) Standards for Perioperative Autologous Blood Collection and Administration, blood units collected by ANH can be stored in the operating room at room temperature (approximately 22&deg;C [72&deg;F]) for up to eight hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The advantage of keeping the blood at room temperature on a mechanical agitator is that platelet function might be better preserved. However, this can be a concern in cold operating rooms.</p><p>If withdrawn units of blood are not used within eight hours, they can be stored at 1 to 6&ordm;C (34 to 43&ordm;F) for up to 24 hours, provided that cold storage is begun within eight hours of initiating blood withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Any units removed from the operating room must contain the statement &quot;For autologous use only&quot; on the label.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reinfusion is guided by estimation of blood loss and serial Hgb determinations. The collected blood is reinfused after major blood loss has ceased, or sooner if indicated (eg, Hgb &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or hemodynamic instability).</p><p>Hemoglobin or hematocrit should be monitored regularly during surgery, with the interval determined according to the anesthesiologist&rsquo;s and surgeon's assessment of blood loss. Intervals as frequent as twice an hour may be appropriate. </p><p>Usually, blood reinfusion is initiated when Hgb is approximately 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit approximately 21 to 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This decision is based upon data from several systematic reviews and randomized trials in both surgical and non-surgical patients in which evidence favored relatively restrictive transfusion triggers (Hgb 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> for a range of clinically relevant outcomes, coupled with the desire to have a degree of protection should excessive bleeding occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. However, the lowest safe Hgb (or hematocrit) level in patients undergoing ANH is unknown, and this level probably varies from individual to individual. In fact, studies including patients undergoing ANH (some from the era prior to modern blood management) have used a wide range of triggers for reinfusion of withdrawn blood, with Hgb levels ranging from 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Non-cardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Furosemide</a> is sometimes administered prior to infusion of the withdrawn blood. However, in the setting of surgery with ongoing bleeding, the administration of furosemide can lead to inappropriate diuresis and iatrogenic hypovolemia. </p><p>The units of blood are usually returned to the patient in the reverse order of collection. This allows the most concentrated unit to be transfused at the time of least bleeding. Thus, the first unit, which has the highest Hgb and contains the most platelets and undiluted coagulation factors, is administered last. However, in certain situations, it may be prudent to change the sequence to ensure that the first unit(s) is not wasted and is administered within eight hours of collection. These situations include development of hypervolemia in response to colloid administration, an inadequate response to diuretics, or an expectation that not all of the donated units will be returned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</span></p><p><strong>Potential advantages:</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) may decrease exposure to allogeneic blood, thereby minimizing or avoiding the risk of transfusion-associated complications (eg, infectious disease, allergic reactions, allosensitization, and the possibility of immunomodulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-blood-conservation-intraoperative-hemodilution/abstract/8,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16-19</a>].
