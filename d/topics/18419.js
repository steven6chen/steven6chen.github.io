If there is evidence of aberrant behaviors, patients may need to be referred to treatment centers for opioid dependence and addictions. The final decision on whether to prescribe will be individualized. However, we do not prescribe opioids to patients who are already receiving opioids from another prescriber.

Common withdrawal symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, lacrimation, diaphoresis, piloerection, mild hypertension and tachycardia, anxiety and irritability, and tremor. The degree of physical dependence is related to the dose and duration of therapy, and is the near universal outcome of chronic daily use. Physical dependence does not constitute the presence of a substance use disorder or addiction, but it can complicate attempts to reduce the dosage or discontinue opioid therapy.

Opioid therapy may not be appropriate for patients who are at high risk for opioid misuse. (See <a href=\"#H2474477232\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of risk prior to initiating therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid therapy should always be initiated as a trial, with the understanding that therapy will be discontinued if harms outweigh benefits <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the goals of therapy are not being met. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pdo_checklist-a.pdf&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsSE6Ql3oKE3l9x3JZSAjFgeKw47dI2wGLpp1Wj2vKFQjcTDpdGGkpqXZF/4dx0xYSg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=93598\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control checklist</a> is a useful tool when prescribing opioids in chronic non-cancer pain. We have all patients complete an opioid pain agreement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consent form prior to initiating opioid therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2103381177\" class=\"local\">'Setting patient responsibilities, expectations, and treatment goals'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1145929491\" class=\"local\">'Opioid agreement/consent form'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When starting opioid-na&iuml;ve patients on a trial of opioid therapy, we start with low doses of <span class=\"nowrap\">IR/SA</span> agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108947 \">table 6</a>). Opioid-na&iuml;ve patients should not be started on <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/LA</span> opioids as initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3913024374\" class=\"local\">'Opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects are common during opioid therapy. In particular, patients on opioids should be monitored for constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, impaired psychomotor function, and urinary retention. (See <a href=\"#H1658035998\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids have the potential to interact with a variety of medications, primarily other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. We avoid concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids, as concurrent use increases the risk of overdose. (See <a href=\"#H414437843\" class=\"local\">'Risks of misuse and overdose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a trial of opioid therapy, the benefits and harms of opioid therapy should be assessed within one month of starting therapy. A shorter interval for follow-up is appropriate for patients who are at higher risk for misuse. (See <a href=\"#H2940093934\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up during trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various risk management strategies may be used to manage patients on opioids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50477 \">table 12</a>). These strategies should be individualized based on the likelihood of problematic drug-related behavior. (See <a href=\"#H1611772836\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and risk management strategies during trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid therapy should only be continued after a trial only in patients who have demonstrated that benefits outweigh harms during an initial trial of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1276290545\" class=\"local\">'Chronic opioid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefits and harms for patients on chronic opioid therapy should be assessed at least every three months for patients on stable doses of opioids. Patients should be seen more frequently after dosing changes, particularly if initiating or increasing long-acting opioids. (See <a href=\"#H239910708\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up and monitoring during chronic opioid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aberrant behaviors occur on a continuum and must be carefully assessed. Aberrant behaviors associated with opioid use include misuse, opioid use disorder, and diversion. (See <a href=\"#H2808265802\" class=\"local\">'Patients with aberrant behaviors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy may be discontinued for a variety of reasons. Patients who are withdrawn from opioid therapy should continue to be treated with nonopioid therapies for their chronic pain. Patients should be gradually tapered off of opioids. (See <a href=\"#H2803959167\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with refractory pain may be candidates for an implantable spinal delivery system that permits intrathecal administration of opioid. Intrathecal analgesic therapy should be reserved for intractable severe pain with significant impact on quality of life that is refractory to all other appropriate treatments. (See <a href=\"#H46344631\" class=\"local\">'Refractory pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some populations have increased risks with the use of opioids (eg, older patients, those with kidney disease and liver failure).
