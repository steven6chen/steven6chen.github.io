In developed nations, about one in four adults have at least two chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], and more than half of older adults have three or more chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As worldwide mortality declines, people are living longer with disability and multiple comorbidities, with important implications for global health care needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the particular challenges posed by managing patients with multiple comorbidities and present strategies to maximize effective care for such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30629397\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multimorbidity refers to the co-occurrence of two or more medical or psychiatric conditions, which may or may not directly interact with each other within the same individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. The term &quot;multimorbidity&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but comorbidity technically indicates a condition or conditions that coexist in the context of an index disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As an example, an oncologist may be concerned with the effect of comorbidity on the management of lung cancer, whereas multimorbidity captures the general complexity of patients without focusing on any single disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>&quot;Multiple chronic conditions&quot; is a term closely related to multimorbidity. Several initiatives in the United States use this term in targeting a population for improving outcomes and care quality. The National Quality Forum defines multiple chronic conditions as &quot;two or more chronic conditions that collectively have an adverse effect on health status, function, or quality of life and that require complex healthcare management, decision-making, or coordination&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This concept recognizes the marked heterogeneity within the large population of individuals with two or more chronic conditions. Hypertension and hypothyroidism, for example, do not generally encompass the same complexity or health needs as heart failure and dementia. Therefore, it can be beneficial to identify a subset of people with multiple chronic conditions that is in particular need of a different paradigm for care. Hereafter, we refer to the more basic definition of multimorbidity as two or more conditions, but recognize that more nuanced definitions may better target interventions towards specific populations that need them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30629384\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although exact prevalence estimates depend on the type and number of conditions considered in the definition of multimorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], most experts agree that more than one in four adults have at least two chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Because the prevalence of many diseases rises with age, multimorbidity is increasingly common throughout the lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/1,3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,15</a>], affecting about 15 percent of Americans between ages 20 to 44 years, 35 percent of Americans aged 65 to 79 years, and 70 percent of Americans aged 80 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 have two or more chronic conditions, and approximately one-third have four or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, a study of all adults over age 65 in Alberta, Canada found that the prevalence of at least three morbidities was 34 percent, which rose to 50 percent over nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Due to the aging of the population and advances in medical care and public health that have allowed people to live longer with incurable diseases, the number and proportion of patients with multiple chronic conditions are growing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. Although the prevalence of multimorbidity is highest among adults age 65 or older, the absolute number of persons with multimorbidity is higher in those younger than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].</p><p>In addition to age, lower socioeconomic status is also associated with a higher prevalence of multimorbidity. In the cross-sectional Scottish study, the age of multimorbidity onset was lower (by 10 to 15 years) among individuals living in the most deprived, compared with the most affluent, areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In Rochester, Minnesota, compared with white persons, multimorbidity was slightly more prevalent in black persons and slightly less prevalent in Asian persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Because certain conditions heighten the risk of developing other conditions, people with multimorbidity are likely to accumulate more diagnoses and experience escalating clinical complexity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. In one study that analyzed data from over 60,000 adults in the Netherlands and adjusted for age and insurance status, individuals with multimorbidity at baseline were 40 percent more likely than those without multimorbidity to be diagnosed with two or more new conditions during the next year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that among 1259 individuals with coronary heart disease who were surveyed, coexisting noncardiac morbidities included arthritis (57 percent), chronic lung disease (25 percent), diabetes (25 percent), renal insufficiency (24 percent), and stroke (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Functional issues included urinary incontinence (49 percent), mobility difficulty (40 percent), falls or dizziness (35 percent), and cognitive impairment (30 percent). The majority of patients (55 percent) were taking four or more medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994430\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multimorbidity is associated with staggering health care utilization and costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. The two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries with multimorbidity account for 96 percent of Medicare expenditures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Individuals with multiple chronic conditions are at heightened risk of significant adverse health outcomes, often beyond the effects of the individual conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/15,18,22-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,22-31</a>].

Among the top 5 percent of Medicare spenders, the majority have both multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994437\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT CARE CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most treatments and practice guidelines target a single index condition, but patients with multimorbidity are complex and heterogeneous. The traditional disease-focused approach to clinical medicine may render care that is fragmented and poorly coordinated and produce treatment plans that are inefficient, ineffective, or even harmful for patients with multimorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/10,20,22,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,22,33-36</a>]. Clinicians have limited guidance or evidence on which to base care decisions for such patients.</p><p>In focus group interviews, primary care clinicians in the United States identified multiple issues in providing care for patients with multimorbidity, including insufficient data about best practices, inadequate support and collaboration with specialists, conflicts between clinician and patient priorities, and reimbursement policies that don't adequately compensate for the effort involved in the management of complex patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a systematic review of 10 studies, involving general practitioners in seven different countries, specific issues identified in managing patients with multimorbidity were: fragmentation of health care, inadequate guidelines and evidence-based medicine, and challenges delivering person-centered care and incorporating shared-decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994444\"><span class=\"h2\">Adherence to multiple clinical practice guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinical practice guidelines are developed with the intent to address the diagnosis or management of a single clinical entity. The challenges and potential harm brought about by rigid adherence to clinical practice guidelines in patients with multimorbidity is illustrated in a paper that examined the hypothetical case of a 79-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In following the most inexpensive and simple treatment plan that would satisfy all guidelines, the hypothetical patient would need to take 12 medications (costing USD $406 per month in 2005) and, each year, follow 14 recommendations related to self-care or education, diagnostic testing, or referrals to other specialists or services (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69591 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81404 \">table 2</a>). Furthermore, different guidelines may offer conflicting recommendations (eg, weightbearing exercise recommended by the osteoporosis guideline conflicts with cautions in weightbearing for neuropathic patients in the diabetes guideline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Although the applicability of most clinical practice guidelines to patients with multimorbidity is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], there are some that do recognize the need to adapt recommendations for patients with increased complexity. Specific steps have been described that may be considered to increase the relevance of guidelines to people with multiple comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/40-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-47</a>]. As an example, the American Geriatrics Society and American Diabetes Association recommendations for the management of older patients with diabetes advocate for prioritization of goals of care among multiple conditions and recommend more permissive targets for glycemic control and blood pressure among patients with frailty or limited life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994451\"><span class=\"h2\">Competing demands and shifting priorities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to competing demands are common when caring for patients with multiple conditions. Patients with multimorbidity typically experience a fluctuating health status, with particular ailments rotating into and out of the forefront in terms of their influence on the patient's overall well-being [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>To maximize quality of life, patients with multimorbidity must strike a daily balance between attending to their health problems, thereby controlling symptoms and reducing flares and complications while avoiding the potential for their lives to be ruled by the demands of chronic disease management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Clinicians' well-meaning attempts to aggressively treat all conditions all the time, without sufficient attention to the whole person and his or her shifting priorities, may result in treatment recommendations that the patient finds overwhelming, unaffordable, or otherwise unrealistic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Clinicians themselves must balance competing demands for their time in attempting to address multiple health issues within the confines of a 15- to 20-minute office visit. By time constraints alone, a primary care provider in the United States with a standard patient panel may be unable to deliver the services recommended for chronic disease management and prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The situation is compounded when a treatment beneficial for one condition (eg, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation) may lead to harm due to a concurrent condition (eg, bleeding from diverticulosis), forcing a prioritization of competing health objectives. Similarly, patients with multimorbidity and the clinicians who provide their care must prioritize conditions that require the most active management and balance treatment strategies consistent with the patient's preferences, tolerance, and needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994459\"><span class=\"h2\">Polypharmacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to a 2010 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, 37 percent of older Americans use five or more prescription drugs each month, and medication use in the United States, which has doubled since 1999, continues to rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Patients with more chronic conditions and more frequent clinical encounters take more medicines and are at the greatest risk of being prescribed potentially inappropriate medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Even when each medication has an appropriate indication, polypharmacy is associated with burden, cost, and risk of drug-drug or drug-condition interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. The important issue of polypharmacy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H18186995\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Polypharmacy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994466\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major challenge in delivering appropriate care to patients with multimorbidity stems from the fact that these complex patients are underrepresented in clinical research populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/34,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,58</a>]. Comorbidities typically are an exclusion factor for patient recruitment into studies addressing a given clinical condition. When investigators do attempt to include representative numbers of patients with multimorbidity in a clinical trial, they often face challenges in terms of recruitment and retention that lead to selection bias and large amounts of missing data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>As a result, the evidence base to guide medical decision-making for these patients is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In the absence of trial data, providers cannot be certain how the presence of coexisting conditions may alter the tolerance or treatment effect of an intervention for a particular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Finally, the heterogeneous nature of multimorbidity makes it difficult to control for confounding or to draw inferences about how a broad array of coexisting conditions may have impacted treatment effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994473\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH MULTIMORBIDITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several strategies for managing the challenges of caring for patients with multimorbidity and opportunities to improve care have emerged from research in this area. A 2016 systematic review of 18 trials to improve outpatient management of patients with multimorbidities found that trials evaluated a variety of interventions that focused either on the organization of care delivery (eg, through case management or enhanced multidisciplinary team work) or were patient-oriented (eg, education or self-management support interventions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The review found little or no difference in clinical outcomes with small improvement in patient-reported outcomes. The available evidence suggests that health outcomes may be improved when interventions target risk factors such as depression or specific functional difficulties.</p><p>A panel convened by the American Geriatrics Society has identified five guiding principles for management of multimorbidity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86695\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86695 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elicit and incorporate patient preferences into medical decision-making</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognize the limitations of the evidence base in interpreting and applying the medical literature to persons with multimorbidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frame clinical management decisions within the context of risks, burdens, benefits, and prognosis (remaining life expectancy, functional status, quality of life)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider treatment complexity and feasibility when making clinical management decisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose therapies that optimize benefit, minimize harm, and enhance the quality of life</p><p/><p>Guidelines for management of multimorbidity have also been developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The guidelines advise:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tailor care to meet personal goals and priorities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess patients for those who would benefit from a specific approach to multimorbidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish what is important to the patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify the impact of disease and treatment burden on quality of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review medications: consider stopping nonessential treatment, consider nonpharmacologic approaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develop an individualized management plan</p><p/><p>We have attempted to highlight key aspects of care delivery for those with multimorbidity that promote coordinated, safe, high-quality care in keeping with patient preferences and feasible within the current health care system, consistent with the American Geriatrics Society guiding principles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994480\"><span class=\"h2\">Elicit patient goals and priorities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Institute of Medicine's report, &quot;Crossing the Quality Chasm,&quot; emphasized that the &quot;true north&quot; of quality in health care is the patient experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This becomes all the more relevant for patients with multimorbidity, given the challenges of conflicting recommendations, competing demands, and limited evidence.</p><p>To optimize care for the individual patient, a provider must understand the patient's goals and preferences and how his or her health relates to perceived roles within a family or community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. The dialogue about patient goals and priorities includes a discussion of end-of-life preferences, as well as medical decision-making to include drug initiation and discontinuation, hospitalizations and procedures, receipt of preventive services, and recommendations for behavioral changes such dietary restrictions and frequency of blood pressure monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Successful elicitation of patient preference requires that the patient and provider communicate effectively and that the patient has an adequate understanding of relevant choices and their expected outcomes. It is important to recognize that patients with multimorbidity frequently have impairments in hearing, vision, or cognition that may restrict communication or their capacity to process information. Special measures may be necessary to overcome the barriers associated with these impairments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58401 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Even in patients without known communication barriers, there is considerable variability in individual's comfort level and desire to engage in the medical decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Approaches to enhancing patient involvement need to be flexible. Factors implicated in successful patient engagement include communication skills of the provider, trust in the relationship, and adequate time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. When available, a referral for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment may be a useful means of clarifying goals and priorities for patients with multimorbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994487\"><span class=\"h2\">Coordination of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with multimorbidity experience frequent clinical encounters, often with multiple providers representing different disciplines across many health care settings (including outpatient, inpatient, emergency department, long-term or rehabilitation facilities, and in-home care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/65,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,69</a>].

An essential component of high-quality care for patients with multimorbidity is coordination of a uniform care plan that is communicated across settings, providers, and caregivers.</p><p>Electronic health records are helpful in coordinating care because they facilitate access to and sharing of information between various providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. For particularly complex medical decisions, direct communication among providers, patients, and caregivers is often the best means of filling in knowledge gaps or arriving at a consensus. Multidisciplinary forums, such as Tumor Boards or Stroke Teams, may provide regular opportunities for discussion of patients by multiple providers involved in a certain aspect of patient care.</p><p>The time constraints of most clinical practices and the fragmented, disease-focused nature of service provision make it challenging to coordinate an overall care plan effectively in the current health care system. Case managers and extended care providers may play an essential role in coordinating care for the most complicated and vulnerable patients within a practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].</p><p>In addition, the value of informal, unpaid caregivers (family and friends) is increasingly recognized, particularly in the care of patients with multimorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Nonprofessional caregivers influence adherence and decision-making, supplement self-care, and frequently accompany patients to office visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. Although questions remain about how to optimally engage and integrate this support network, such caregivers are often instrumental in managing &quot;the big picture&quot; for patients with multimorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>].</p><p>Innovative models show promise in their ability to promote more seamless, efficient, and holistic care for older adults with multimorbidity. These programs often incorporate many aspects of the Wagner Chronic Care model, which emphasizes system elements that promote coordinated care by creating partnerships among patients, their families and informal caregivers, and providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. Examples of these models of care include Guided Care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>], the Program of All-Inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>], Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders (GRACE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], and the Patient-Centered Medical Home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Integrated care, involving both psychiatric and medical specialty providers, to address the medical conditions and depression that frequently coexist in older patients with chronic medical problems can improve quality of life and disability outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994494\"><span class=\"h2\">Less may be best</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every intervention, hospitalization, or medication prescribed creates the potential for harm.

Cancer screening in patients with multiple comorbidities is associated with unfavorable risk to benefit ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>], and screening should be discontinued in patients with less than a five-year life expectancy or in those who would decline treatment if disease is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. The types and severity of comorbid conditions present can help guide estimates of life expectancy and inform personalized decisions about when to cease routine cancer screening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F96330\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96330 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

The Institute of Medicine has proposed a standardized schedule for specifying medication dosing (morning, noon, evening, bedtime), recognizing that 90 percent of prescriptions are taken four or fewer times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolidate treatments when possible (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor for blood pressure, renal protection, and heart failure).</p><p/><p>A concept of &quot;time to benefit&quot; (TTB) has been considered in relation to drug prescribing for patients who have multiple morbidities and also may have limited life expectancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. This concept has also been identified as &quot;time horizon to benefit&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. TTB, defined as the time to significant benefit observed in trials of people treated with a drug compared with controls, can be estimated from data from randomized controlled trials. Such information may help guide decision-making for drug prescribing in individual patients, although it should be recognized that patients with multimorbidity are often excluded from randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30994501\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify and address issues that impact multiple conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One efficient way to promote better outcomes for patients with multimorbidity is to identify issues that affect a patient's well-being or quality of life in ways that cut across many diseases. Examples of these issues include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical <span class=\"nowrap\">activity/exercise</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Function/independence</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safety of environment and adequacy of support in current level of care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caregiver stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624058\"><span class=\"h2\">Common disease-specific considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even in patients with multimorbidity, it is sometimes appropriate to apply typical management strategies to individual chronic conditions. For example, aggressive management of heart failure may be necessary to prevent exacerbations and frequent hospitalizations. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) should receive a trial of beta blockers, even in the setting of comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because many patients with COPD tolerate beta blockers and the treatment benefit of beta blockers post-MI is clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the presence of comorbidity frequently dictates the need to adjust the treatment plans for individual conditions. Due to the heterogeneity of comorbidities that may coexist with any condition, it is not feasible to provide a uniform set of guidelines for the management of a specific disease in patients with multimorbidity. The guiding principle in patients with multimorbidity should be individualization of treatment. We have highlighted frequent considerations that arise in the setting of two common comorbidities, which may justify departure from rigid adherence to disease-specific guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624113\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A target hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 8 percent is appropriate in persons with limited life expectancy or persons in whom the risks of hypoglycemia outweigh the benefit of more aggressive targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. As an example, the risk of hypoglycemia may be elevated in persons who have difficulty maintaining consistent caloric intake due to gastrointestinal comorbidities or conditions that cause frequent nausea or anorexia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin therapy may be inappropriate in patients with cognitive or visual impairments that increase the risk of medication error, unless the patient has a caregiver with the ability to assist with every insulin dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in older adults, particularly those with comorbidities. Thus, when possible, therapeutic agents should be selected that have a lower risk for hypoglycemia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, shorter-acting sulfonylurea, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repaglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">repaglinide</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) in patients with type 2 diabetes who are diet-treated or treated with oral agents that are not associated with hypoglycemia is not as clear as for other diabetic patients. Thus, advice regarding SMBG for older diabetic patients, and especially those with comorbidity, should be tailored to the patient, based upon medications and functional and cognitive abilities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolytes and renal function should be assessed within one to two weeks of initiation or dose adjustments of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or diuretics, due to the increased likelihood of adverse effects in patients with multimorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/managing-multiple-comorbidities/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-the-older-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the older patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H624140\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients should receive nonpharmacologic therapy, particularly dietary salt restriction and weight loss in obese patients.

More permissive blood pressure targets are appropriate, if patient preferences favor quality of life over potential benefit of additional blood pressure reduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in older adults, particularly isolated systolic hypertension&quot;, section on 'Goal blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities should guide choice of agent. The goal is to avoid exacerbating comorbid conditions (eg, discontinue beta blockers if they worsen reactive airway disease or diuretics if they exacerbate urinary incontinence) and to minimize polypharmacy (eg, choose an alpha blocker to simultaneously address benign prostatic hypertrophy and hypertension, rather than prescribing a separate medication for each condition).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
