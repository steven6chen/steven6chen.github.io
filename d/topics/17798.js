This was best shown in a meta-analysis of three studies with 4651 nondialysis CKD patients, in which there was a 35 percent increase in mortality per mg increase in phosphate above normal values (95% CI 1.16-1.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The median follow-up in individual studies was approximately one to two years. In one study (which was included in the meta-analysis), serum phosphate &gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Hyperphosphatemia is a stimulus for hyperparathyroidism.

One study published after the cited meta-analysis did not show an association between quartiles of serum phosphate and mortality over a mean follow-up of 2.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

These recommendations are consistent with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and KDIGO guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,12,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4073137610\" class=\"local\">'Phosphate restriction'</a> below.)</p><p>Many patients have increased serum phosphate despite dietary phosphate restriction. For most patients who have persistently and progressively elevated phosphate despite dietary phosphate restriction, we suggest phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,22-24</a>].</p><p>In a randomized trial, compared with placebo, the use of phosphate binders was associated with a greater decrease in serum phosphate and in 24-hour urine phosphate at three, six, and nine months, although the effect was small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, the use of phosphate binders was associated with a stable parathyroid hormone (PTH) value versus an increase in the placebo group.</p><p>No randomized trials have shown a benefit of phosphate binders on clinically relevant endpoints, however. A retrospective cohort of nondialysis CKD patients demonstrated a 23 percent decrease in mortality associated with phosphate binder therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, this apparent benefit could stem from unequal periods of follow-up; the median period of follow-up was approximately four years for patients not given phosphate binders compared with just two years for patients treated with phosphate binders.</p><p>Some experts do not recommend phosphate binders, since no randomized trials have demonstrated a clinically relevant benefit of phosphate binders. Also, as noted above, studies have suggested that phosphate binders are only minimally effective in lowering serum phosphate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].</p><p>In addition, the prescription of a phosphate binder increases the patient's pill burden.</p><p>An additional concern is that calcium-containing phosphate binders may induce positive calcium balance in patients with CKD, which could lead to vascular calcification. This issue is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H169682201\" class=\"local\">'Specific treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The selection of type of phosphate binder is the same for dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients and is discussed below.

This was best shown in a meta-analysis of 12 studies that included 92,345 patients with CKD, over 97 percent of whom were on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among 10 studies that were perceived to be adequately adjusted (in which seven studies were of dialysis patients), serum phosphate &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> was associated with increased mortality. Based upon 13 studies that reported a continuous relative risk for each <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> increase in phosphate, the mortality risk increased by 18 percent (95% CI 1.12-1.25).</p><p>A target phosphate goal between 3.5 and 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.13 and 1.78 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is consistent with the KDOQI guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This target differs from the more recent KDIGO guidelines, which recommend lowering levels toward the normal range but do not specify a target threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. We feel that the KDIGO recommendations do not provide a practical goal.</p><p>No randomized study has evaluated whether achieving these serum phosphate targets affects clinically important outcomes among dialysis patients.</p><p>The initial therapy includes phosphate restriction and phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28</a>].</p><p>We suggest a moderate restriction of phosphate intake in dialysis patients, provided that this can be done without compromising nutritional status. These recommendations are consistent with the KDOQI and KDIGO guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22</a>].</p><p>We restrict dietary phosphate to 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Among dialysis patients, phosphate restriction should be done under the supervision of a dietician. This is because many dialysis patients have either overt or borderline malnutrition. For such patients, protein supplementation (which contributes to phosphorus intake) rather than protein restriction is the goal. In this setting, the patient should be encouraged to avoid unnecessary dietary phosphate (such as phosphate-containing food additives, dairy products, certain vegetables, many processed foods, and colas), while increasing the intake of high-biologic-value sources of protein (such as meat and eggs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4073137610\" class=\"local\">'Phosphate restriction'</a> below.)</p><p>While we may try dietary restriction first and only use a phosphate binder if the phosphate is persistently and progressively elevated after one or two months of dietary phosphorus restriction, most patients will also require a phosphate binder. Many clinicians will start dietary phosphate restriction and phosphate binders simultaneously in all patients with hyperphosphatemia.</p><p>Two observational studies have suggested that phosphate binders are associated with decreased mortality among dialysis patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, observational study of incident dialysis patients followed for one year, the use of phosphate binders was associated with a 25 percent lower one-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 6797 patients enrolled in an observational, prospective study (Current Management of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: A Multicenter Observational Study [COSMOS]), patients prescribed phosphate binders had a 29 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 22 percent lower risk of cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>Randomized trials are needed to determine whether the use of phosphate binders provides a benefit on clinically important endpoints among dialysis patients.</p><p>The choice of phosphate binder is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H169682201\" class=\"local\">'Specific treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to phosphate restriction and binders, it is important to make sure patients are adequately dialyzed and achieving recommended <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> targets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in patients who are undergoing standard in-center hemodialysis (which represents most hemodialysis patients), we do not generally increase the dialysis above the recommended dose, as this has not been shown to improve clinically important outcomes.

The average standard dialysis session removes approximately 900 mg of phosphate.</p><p>Some patients may consider daily or nocturnal (ie, usually prolonged and nightly) hemodialysis. Frequent or prolonged hemodialysis leads to greater removal of phosphate and can substantially lower serum phosphate levels. In fact, in some patients undergoing frequent or prolonged hemodialysis, serum phosphate can be controlled without the use of phosphate binders. However, many factors impact a decision to undergo daily dialysis, and hyperphosphatemia alone is rarely the deciding factor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Phosphate'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Phosphate'</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, hyperphosphatemia will be refractory to these methods.

Moreover, no good studies have examined the efficacy of dietary phosphate restrictions on patient-important outcomes.</p><p>Approximately 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of dietary phosphate is a level that at least some patients will find acceptable. Phosphate restriction should primarily include processed foods and colas and <strong>not</strong> high-biologic-value foods such as meat and eggs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79877%7EPI%2F56081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79877 graphicRef56081 \">table 1A-B</a>). Food additives (as are found in processed foods) are an important source of dietary phosphate. In addition to having high phosphate content, highly processed foods provide a more easily absorbed form of phosphate compared with fresh animal- and plant-based foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We agree with the KDIGO guidelines that patients should receive education on the absorbability of phosphate from different food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some nephrologists recommend a more vegetarian-based diet in order to control phosphate. Phosphate bioavailability may be less with a vegetarian compared with animal protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Many foods that have traditionally been labeled high phosphate (such as beans and nuts) may actually be acceptable (providing they are not too high in potassium) because phosphate from these sources is absorbed slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is because plant-derived phosphate found in unprocessed foods is in the form of phytate phosphorus, and the human intestine does not secrete phytase, the enzyme required for absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A randomized study of hemodialysis patients showed that careful instruction on avoiding foods with phosphorus additives resulted in larger declines in serum phosphate compared with control patients who did not receive such instruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Very few studies have examined the efficacy of dietary phosphate restrictions on patient-important outcomes among dialysis patients. In a post-hoc analysis of data from the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, prescribed phosphate restriction was not associated with improved survival of hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In fact, there was a stepwise trend toward better survival with less restrictive prescribed phosphate intake in this study. However, the HEMO study was performed prior to an awareness of the importance of food additives as a source of phosphate; as a result, phosphate restriction may have been achieved by the restriction of nutritionally beneficial food. Supporting this possibility, phosphate restriction tended to be associated with poorer nutritional indices and a persistently greater need for nutritional supplementation in this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687951240\"><span class=\"h3\">Phosphate binders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphate binders are categorized as calcium containing and noncalcium containing. Calcium-containing binders include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium acetate</a>. Major noncalcium-containing binders include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> and lanthanum. All are effective in lowering phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>We suggest that noncalcium-containing binders be used, except in situations where they are not available or affordable. Noncalcium-containing phosphate binders have been associated with lower mortality. However, limitations in the clinical trial data along with the higher cost and restricted availability of these agents make calcium-containing agents an acceptable alternative. For normocalcemic or hypocalcemic patients who cannot take noncalcium-containing binders for any reason (including cost), calcium-containing binders may be used. This approach is largely consistent with the 2017 KDIGO guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among the noncalcium-containing binders, we tend to favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> rather than lanthanum because there are more long-term data regarding safety available.

Specific doses are provided below.</p><p>A number of studies and two meta-analyses have suggested that noncalcium-containing phosphate binders decrease mortality among CKD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/37-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-47</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 11 open-label, randomized trials (4622 patients) revealed a 22 percent decrease in all-cause mortality among patients randomly assigned to receive noncalcium-based binders (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a>, 10 studies including 3268 patients, or lanthanum, one study including 1354 patients) compared with calcium-based binders (relative risk [RR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The results of this meta-analysis were driven in large part by the study that used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanthanum-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanthanum carbonate</a> not sevelamer. Analysis of dialysis and nondialysis CKD patients showed similar reductions in mortality. Most studies in this meta-analysis were limited to 24 months. Analysis of studies with follow-up at 36 and 42 months showed no difference in mortality, possibly because of insufficient power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This analysis did not look at cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>A second meta-analysis also reported a decrease in all-cause mortality with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> compared with calcium-based binders (13 studies, n = 3799, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Although there was a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (four studies, n = 2712, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07-1.64), this reduction was not statistically significant. Patients receiving sevelamer had lower cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, calcium, and decreased risk of hypercalcemia. There was no difference between groups in serum phosphate. There was considerable heterogeneity among the studies.</p><p>In addition to the possible effects on mortality, calcium-containing binders, but not noncalcium-containing binders, are associated with hypercalcemia, adynamic bone disease, and vascular calcification, all which could result in increased morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,37,39,41,42,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37,39,41,42,49,50</a>].</p><p>Vascular calcification may result from a positive calcium balance induced by calcium-containing binders. Normal dietary calcium intake is on the order of 1000 mg per day. The prescription of 500 mg elemental calcium (1250 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>) with meals therefore leads to a substantial increment in calcium intake. In a short-term study of eight patients with CKD stage 3 or 4, calcium carbonate given with meals resulted in positive total-body calcium balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Although net bone balance was positive, positive net bone balance was less than overall positive calcium balance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Positive calcium and phosphate balance and calcium intake'</a>.)</p><p>These potential effects of calcium-containing binders may depend on whether the patient is also receiving other calcium supplements or vitamin D analogs.</p><p>It is not clear that the potential benefits of noncalcium-containing phosphate binders are observed in all CKD patients. This is an important issue since noncalcium-containing binders are much more expensive than calcium-containing binders.</p><p>For all phosphate buffers, the lowest dose that is effective should be used. If calcium-containing buffers are selected, we suggest that the total dose of elemental calcium (including dietary sources) not exceed 2000 mg per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The amount of elemental calcium contained in the phosphate binder should not exceed 1500 mg per day.
